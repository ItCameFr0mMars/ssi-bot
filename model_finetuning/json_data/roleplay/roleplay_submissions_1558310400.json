            "selftext": "He died in a patch of sunlight- that\u2019s about the only good thing Genevieve can say about her last holder. And she\u2019s been sat with his corpse for\u2026\n\nA while. She doesn\u2019t like to think about how long.\n\nShe\u2019s watched plants crawl into this funny little building, eating away at it bit by bit. They open the skylight a little more each month, each year. At first she was miffed that they were stealing her sunlight- now they\u2019re good company. She names new leaves, mourns the ones that fall away. Curls up into a lonely ball when the cold white light and the colder white snow kills them away.\nShe befriends some of the animals that roam in, and takes a delight in scaring the rest. \n\n\u201cSee?\u201d She says to empty, dusty air when the rat or the bird scampers away. \u201cI\u2019m still here. I\u2019m still *here.*\u201d\n\nNothing answers, because nothing ever answers. No matter how loud she screams. Maybe there\u2019s nothing that can- maybe nothing wants to answer the thing that screams in a broken down building.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t care anymore. She just likes the noise.\n\nShe can replicate bird calls now even without recording and replaying them. She can get curious big crows peaking in through the gaps to figure out what she is. Once, she even managed to lure a feral cat. It had hissed at her when it saw her, scared and uncertain. It had made her smile for months.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still here.\u201d\n\nShe talks to the holder\u2019s skeleton. Half of his skull is bleached in sunlight. Most of the time she just swears at him, swears at her own ineffectiveness as she tries to kick bits of him across the room.\nSometimes it feels like she\u2019s not here at all.\n\nShe tries not to think, but it doesn\u2019t work, so she tries not to think of people. Only animals and plants; she doesn\u2019t want for company because humans don\u2019t exist. She\u2019s nothing. She\u2019s the walls, she\u2019s impassive, she watches and observes, she enjoys and tries to insist on her existence to the world.\n\nOther times, pretending doesn\u2019t work. She sits and cries silly ineffective tears and has conversations with the walls. She pretends her holder is still alive. She swears at him some more.\n\nBut now, in the hot summer light that leaves her so energized, she sits and talks to the new leaves on the creeping ivy.\n\n**About this thingy!**\n\nYep, looking again! If I didn't reply to you after my previous post, I'm super sorry. Tried to get to everyone but Reddit's inbox system is very disorganised. \n\nGene, more commonly known as Genevieve or Eugene dependent on the gender chosen, was an AI popular within the military when the disaster hit. Used for combat and terrain analysis, they were installed into most soldier\u2019s helmets. Now, three hundred and forty nine years later, there\u2019s only one functioning copy left. If you can call Genevieve functioning, that is.\n\nShe\u2019s installed into an earpiece set, a dusty scratched silver thing that fits snugly over the shell of the ears and attaches around the back of the head by a thin band. She charges via solar power. She has two forms; one is simply to function as the headset, invisible. The other is what looks like a holographic image of a young woman with stereotypically attractive features wearing a short sleeved dress.\n\nGenevieve\u2019s long length of activity has, essentially, broken her. Her previous owner, who she calls a holder, also made some large alterations to her and the way she functions. She\u2019s much more human as a result. Her lack of company has affected her close to as much as it would affect a real person, so her attitude isn\u2019t predictable.\n\nI\u2019d be very happy to roleplay with anyone as Gene! You'll have to be okay with roleplaying with someone under 18. The only requirements are that the world they\u2019re in is an apocalyptic one (zombies, wasteland, plague, you name it and I\u2019ll be happy with it. If you insist on me picking, then just say and I\u2019ll shoot an explanation of why the world is the way it is), you\u2019re not afraid to start conflict, and you write somewhere at 2+ paragraphs per reply. More is appreciated.\n\nI don't mind if you want to talk about the RP more or just start roleplaying from the get go. I want to write either over Reddit (PMs or I'll make us a subreddit), email or Google Docs. I won't use Discord, sorry.\n\nHope to hear from you!",

            "selftext": "Hello, my name is Coffee! I am a girl who loves high fantasy, medieval fantasy, all of the likes. I have a plot that I would love to do, especially with an open-minded partner who loves fantasy (especially medieval/renaissance type fantasy, think DnD or Skyrim). I enjoy especially doing MxM (gay. two guys) roleplays, but I don't mind FxF or MxF. But just keep in mind that I have the most experience with MxM.\n\n\nYour character is from Earth. Your character can be you or an OC, but please no canon characters from fandoms. They suddenly find themselves stranded in my fantasy world (it's quite DnD esque, but I'd rather you go in blind to the world and then learn about it through the roleplay). I'd be like the dungeon master and play all of the other characters and interactions, guiding you through my world and the plot. I would probably prefer you play a male character, but if I really like your female character, then I wouldn't mind that at all! Also, I'd like for this story to have some romance. That's just about the gist. It would be in 3rd person and literate. \n\n\nSo here are some things I ask of you, the player:\n\n\nPlease be literate. I like writing complex stories that are novel-esque.\n\nPlease be open-minded. By that, I mean that my world is going to be weird. Weird things might happen. I don't like being generic!\n\nPlease have some experience with fantasy, especially medieval/renaissance fantasy (you know, elves and dragons and the such). I'd much prefer if you're as avid a fan as me, but as long as you know a thing or two about the genre, fine by me.\n\nIf you're interested, please message me! Thanks for reading. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.",

            "selftext": " \n\n**Rookshaven** is one of the longest running, lore-intensive group role playing storylines on Discord right now.\n\nBased in present-day northern Scotland, Rookshaven Academy and University is a school for mages, though the storyline only allows for university students and professors to be applied. We're about 30+ players strong! \n\n**A bit about our lore:**\n\nThe mage community has always held their royal families above the rest. Though they aren't considered kings or queens of their mage classes anymore, the royal families are believed to be the first blood lines to develop their particular kind of magics. As such, royalty have always been the law-makers for mages worldwide. In the late 1800s, a rebel sect of mages rose up to attack the royals and all of their complicit, loyal subjects - resulting in a Mage Civil War.\n\nMany mages and their royal families were killed off, while the beast mage class disappeared entirely. From that war, the High Council was formed. A collection of the remaining royal houses, electing one member of their family to represent them in the governing of the mage community.\n\nUnfortunately, out of the original eight royal families, only four are alive in present day. Additionally, two new mage classes have been discovered. Without a way to track the new class's lineage, Mythics and Necromancers have been left without a representative in the Council. As a result, many laws passed since their discovery have been created seemingly for the purpose of keeping Necromancers and Mythics at a disadvantage. While the newest class, Mythics, are sigil-bound at a young age to feel an automatic pull toward royal families, they often grow up to be employed as maids or servants for the royals.\n\nSince 2016, another uprising of rebels has been seen. Between then and 2019 (present day), many royals and loyalists alike have lost their lives in terrorist attacks by these Rebels. In the last year of the group story on Discord, students have been attacked both on and off campus, leading many to believe there are Rebels among the ranks of Rookshaven, despite the school being run by the Council.\n\nAs of January 1st, 2019, the light binding Royal family in its entirety was wiped out in an attack from a hybridized spell known as Shadow Fire.\n\n**What you can expect:**\n\n\\- Monthly events in which your character can earn points to put into their dice, making them stronger.\n\n\\- Lots of lore.\n\n\\- High Activity.\n\n\\- Outlined mage classes, as well as factions to push their own agendas (Royals, Loyalists, Rebels, Sympathizers).\n\n\\- Friendly players willing to work with new players to create backstories and social networks.\n\n\\- A secondary server only viewable to applied and approved players where you can post playlists, aesthetic images, social media posts, journal entries, as well as having 1-2 private channels specific to your character for housing and training.\n\n\\- Active Staff willing to help new players any way we can and get players immersed in the story faster.\n\n\\- Patience. It's a lot of lore. It's okay if it takes a while to get through it all.\n\n\\- An NPC Library to check out characters for scenes when your own characters are locked down.\n\n\\- Full transparency. We hold honesty and clear communication above everything.\n\n**What we expect:**\n\n\\- literacy\n\n\\- a 3 paragraph minimum per post (there are exceptions to this, but the majority of players should strive for this)\n\n\\- realistic characters that fit the server lore\n\n\\- activity every 2 weeks, or communication with the Admins if you need to take time away\n\n\\- read the FAQ\n\n\\- a drive to grow as a writer\n\n**Classes Available:**\n\n\\- Air\n\n\\- Fire\n\n\\- Water\n\n\\- Darkness\n\n\\- Light\n\n\\- Spirit\n\n\\- Earth\n\n\\- Necromancy\n\n\\- Beast (small wait list)\n\n**Locked Classes:**  \n\\- Hybrid Mages (mages born from opposite classed parents, or from one Mirskoy parent)  \n\\- Variant Mages (mages descended from hybrids whose abilities manifest as a variation of two classes)\\*  \n\\- Mythic Class \\*\n\n\\* *Available as a secondary character with Admin approval, or as a check-out from the NPC library.*\n\n**Royal Families Available:**\n\n\\- Air ( 1 open availability slot left)\n\n\\- Fire\n\n\\- Dark\n\n\\- Spirit\n\n**Upcoming/Ongoing Events:**  \n\\- Hybrid Relations Act Event (abduction &amp; experimentation on hybrid mages)  \n\\- Internment Arc  \n\\- Summer Trips  \n\\- Sigil Exclusion Arc  \n\\- Alumni Formal  \n\\- Tattoo Arc\n\n[Link to Rookshaven on Discord](https://discord.gg/64HWFYy)",

Slowly, but not as slowly as Sindrae would have liked.\n\n\"Bugger,\" she hissed, dropping a handful of sizzling tinder. Her campfire refused to do anything but swallow whatever heat she gave it and repay her with a belch of fast dying smoke.\n\nThe forest was warm enough under sunshine, but the breeze was already growing chillier. It bit at the exposed skin of her arms and wormed underneath her hair to prickle the back of her neck.\n\nTk. Tk. Pss- the spark from her flint and steel flamed the dry grass and died immediately.\n\n\"Oh for-\" She bit her lip hard to force the curse back. She wanted to get warm. She wanted a cup of tea. More than anything, she wanted to not be eaten by bloody wolves in the middle of the night.\n\n\"This is what you get, idiot,\" she mumbled to herself. \"'We don't have to stop here. We can keep going. We'll make camp at the next clearing.' Now look at you.\"\n\nTk. Tk. Pss-\n\nIf her muttering hadn't alerted anyone to her presence, her frustrated scream definitely would.\n\n**DONE**\n\nSo, what's your character going to do? Help her? Be just as bad at camping as her? Rob her? Attack her?\n\nA description of Sindrae:\n\nElf, 5'7\", skinny but with well muscled legs from lots of walking and riding and hunting. Strong, sharp jaw, large brown eyes, fine features. She's dressed in a vest, trousers and well worn leather boots. Her backpack is clearly stuffed and thrown behind her at the base of a tree. A dagger is beside her foot. Tanned, freckled skin and chin length black hair. Her right ear has a chunk taken out of the top, but you wouldn't notice unless you were perceptive. A burn scar under her chin and a few along her lower arms.\n\nPlease shoot a message if you're interested! This can just be a one off meeting of strangers and we never write together again, or it can grow to more if we like it. Hope to hear from you! :)",

God I feel old)\n-  I\u2019m looking for someone closer to my age (which has been a little challenging, but I know you\u2019re out there as RP has been about for a while!)\n- I\u2019ve got a theatrical and creative background and used to working with creative types (spitballing ideas but not getting precious about it if you hate it, and would rather work in tandem rather than my way or highway)\n- I\u2019m Australian, which I know makes things a little tricky too timezone wise. I\u2019m looking for someone who might want to share a google doc to post paragraphs or build chapters novella style. I\u2019m quick to post when I get going, and can be available over weekends for quickfire posts too.\n- 3rd person is preferred, and I\u2019m pretty laid back. I\u2019m not going to pick on you and I\u2019d prefer not to be picked on. As long as you\u2019re literate, it\u2019s all good. It\u2019s for fun!\n- I like video games, dank memes, horror movies, and singing loudly in the bathroom.\n\nStuff that I like to write;\n- I don\u2019t really do fandom or cannon characters, I prefer creating my own. I don\u2019t mind using a pre existing fandom for world setting (GOT, Elder Scrolls, ect) \n- I actually have a sweet Sci-Fi plot Id like to roll out, given if you\u2019re into that. The world is pretty much built.\n- Vamps/werewolves/mermaids.\n- Zombie Apocalypse.\n- Robots (Detroit become human vibes?)\n- Medieval settings.\n- Modern day whatever/slice o life.\n- Fine with writing physical intimacy scenes as long as it\u2019s part of the story, not really into stand alone smut (I hate that word)\n- Love, love, love romance. Particularly building tension and exploring power dynamics. I usually prefer it as the central point to my writing.\n- Power dynamics in general, really. Romance or not.\n- I used to do a lot of feral (wolves/foxes) essentially a wolf with a voice and exploring pack dynamics - ect. Kind of weird. Think Animals of Farthing wood. Crap I\u2019m showing my age again aren\u2019t I.\n- I don\u2019t mind male or female applicants. I do prefer to play female characters though. \n\nHappy to develop a friendship. I\u2019m a pretty friendly, quirky kind of girl. Happy to tell you lots of useless information about Australia and send you photos of my fat cat.\n\nUnderstand life happens. I work full time and have a life too. So I\u2019ll be transparent if I need time to respond.\n\nTell me about you?",

You've never quite fitted in, for some reason, and that came across.\n\nStill, you managed to gulp down your fears and do probably the bravest thing you've ever done, so brave that you can't quite believe it; offer me a ride home from school in your terrifically unreliable car. Between taking ten minutes to get it started in the morning and after school, to spluttering up hills, to overheating on the highway, to regular breakdowns at the side of the road, there's no limit to the trouble it has caused you, but despite all that, on this cold and wet day, you catch up with me and say..._\n\nThat's just an idea for a story setup which I think has the potential to turn into a fun few paragraphs of fun writing; why not send me your first post? Let's write embarrassment and awkwardness and people from different backgrounds coming together and falling in love. Through oodles of adversity, of course. \n\nWe can exchange a few posts and see where the story takes us. Perhaps our characters are destined to be together or perhaps fate doesn't want it to happen.\n\nGot another idea? Let's hear it! I'm happy to write something slightly more challenging too - historical fiction is my favourite. Let's be star-crossed lovers in the 19th century instead.",

            "selftext": "Hey everyone! It's been a while since my last post and I'm ready to dive back into roleplaying. I'll make this short and to the point! The Secret Society is a roleplay about a world where a small percentage of humans are born with a power of some sort. The story begins with our character's signing up for a fighting tournament being held by those with powers; only those with powers may enter--mainly because their powers must stay hidden from the government/public. Our characters can know each other, but they don't have to.\n\nThe RP is meant to have more of a lighthearted beginning with a friendly (yet illegal) fighting tournament between those with powers, they are known as Oddities (Oddity singular). Slowly but surely the plot will become a descent into madness with much darker themes and all of that good jazz.  \n\n\nThis will probably be my last post regarding this specific RP. I just don't want to have too many RP's rolling at once so I may be a bit pickier about who I continue with! No hard feelings &lt;4  \n\n\nWhat I'm looking for in a partner:\n\n* 18+ in age!\n* 2-3 responses per day, minimum. If real life is getting in the way of this just let me know and I'll understand.\n* Literacy! At least a paragraph per response unless the scene doesn't call for it.\n* Just let me know if you're not interested in the RP. Ghosting is half the reason I took a break from RP.\n* Friendly OOC chat! This one isn't necessarily required but it's fun.\n* Able to flesh out a decent character. Also consider the drawbacks of having a particular power, if any. Makes the RP a lot more interesting if there's a personal struggle with one's power due to lack of training or just the nature of the power.\n\nThat's it, really! If you're interested just shoot me a DM and we can discuss things further! Thanks for reading.",

It overcame all other senses, and made me irrational. Never did I imagine I would allow myself to love - let alone love a man, but now I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about him. He was in danger. Not because of me - well, partly because of me - but because of who and what he was. He was my weakest and strongest point, and they were using him against me. \n\nHumans were incredibly fragile. Spending time with them, I also learned how incredibly resilient they were. They were strong, compassionate, and able to overcome many things. He made me realize it. His love of life sparked something in me, awakening a light inside my soul I had lost a long time ago. Suddenly, I wanted to breathe the same air he breathes and share his energy. \n\nThe more we loved each other the stronger we became. I\u2019m not just saying emotionally or mentally, but we noticed a physical change in our bodies whenever we were close to one another. I was powerful before I met him, but was ten times stronger with him. And when apart\u2026 we thirsted for each other. I was noticeably weaker without him - I was my average, \u201cbefore him\u201d self, but I took notice. \n\nI became acutely aware of his location at all times - by his scent, his energy, his body heat, and his emotions. I had NEVER experienced this before.

My character is the alpha male of a strong werewolf or shapeshifter pack (wolves, panthers, coyotes, leopards - whatever) who falls immediately smitten with a human. It\u2019s not uncommon, but it\u2019s extremely rare/forbidden to fall for a human of the same. \n\nThey have an uncanny relationship, and it becomes more noticeable the more they are around each other and their feelings grow.\n\nLooking for a multipara, literate role player for this.

            "selftext": "Hey, everyone. These days I'm usually looking for fandoms, but I decided to resurrect all my old original concepts on the off chance I might find a really great partnership (or two). Hopefully I'll catch someone's eye. (:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do have a few things for which I'm specifically looking in a partner, though, so let me lay those out for you before I get ahead of myself:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. I'm looking for \"advanced/literate\" partners with as much love of the language as I have (know your possessives, \"your\" vs. \"you're,\" proper comma usage, etc.).\n2. I only do hetero pairings, and my characters in these ideas are all female.\n3. I'm a SFW writer. Think PG-13; I love romance and conflict, but don't get gross.  That said, 18+ partners are still preferred. I'm in my mid-20s, so I don't feel comfortable writing with minors.\n4. Email is preferred, but I can do others. Just ask.\n5. I don't do one-liners. Multi-para, please (unless the scene requires otherwise).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlrighty, so, ideas next? I think so.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA. **Moon Dancers (Medieval Fantasy):**\n\nMost of life as humanity knows it is lived during the day. The world awakens at dawn and retires at dusk, unfailingly. There are nocturnal beasts, of course, but those are just animals. And what traveler or criminal hasn\u2019t stayed up to walk by the moonlight many a time himself? Even still, night is meant for sleep and silence, and daytime for work and play.  But that\u2019s not true of every sentient race in the world.\n\nThere is a race of people, called the Aventine (AH-ven-teen), who not only live their lives at night, but are physically incapable of retaining consciousness in the daytime. Think of them as the \u201celves\u201d of the world \u2013 magical, fairly mysterious, largely peaceful, in tune with nature. Not a lot has been known about them over the centuries. They keep to themselves most of the time.\n\nIn old days, they would even play harmless, good-natured tricks on their human counterparts, or leave playful messages, or sit and soothe a child who had awakened in the night while his parents slept on. There was goodwill between the two peoples. They were seen as anything from myth and folklore, to guardian angels, to fairies, to spirits of good fortune and blessing. But just as with anything people don\u2019t understand, mystery eventually turned to wariness. A wedge was driven between them as mutual suspicion and fear began to take root, and the \u201cMoon Dancers\u201d (humanity\u2019s nickname for them) withdrew into themselves. They have to be the more proactive in protecting themselves, after all, because of their very nature.\n\nLike I said, the Aventine are only active at night. When the morning comes, they immediately fall into a deep slumber, like flowers that only bloom in the evening. Nothing can break that sleep, and it\u2019s not possible to \u201cstay up late.\u201d They\u2019re completely vulnerable if this happens out in the world \u2013 not something you really want when the other race finds you unnerving at best and downright malicious at worst. What usually happens, and is supposed to happen, is that they retreat into the Vale, a magical  place kind of existing outside the normal realm. There, they\u2019re free to sleep and dream away the whole day.\n\nNow, I have in mind to play a young Aventine woman with your typical failings of curiosity, rebelliousness, wanderlust, and inquisitiveness. She\u2019s restless with this careful life of secrecy, always watching the sleepy human towns and villages, wondering if they\u2019re really so bad. I\u2019d like the other role to be left up to you: do you want to play a human? Someone who encounters her, with ensuing potential for adventure as they learn about each other and have to protect each other from their respective peoples? Or do you want to play another Aventine who is either tasked with  keeping her out of trouble or is trying to convince her because he actually cares for her, with that potential for adventure as they\u2019re discovered and cut off from the Vale and have to navigate this terrifying world ruled by humans? There are lots of possibilities here, and I\u2019d really like to brainstorm with you more about the world, the story, etc. The only thing I ask is to play against a male character, because\u2026hopeless romantic.\\~\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nB. **The Wyv (Medieval Fantasy):**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are beings called Wyverns in the world. They have a form that looks like normal humans on the surface, and they were once a thriving, powerful race. They have formidable magic, live extraordinarily long lives, are even purported to have prophetic capabilities, and their other forms are similar to dragons - hence the name. Derp. They lived largely in peace with the other races of the world, even somewhat deified by mortals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA long time ago, the other races of the world started hunting them like animals, sometimes for the hide of their beast forms, sometimes to harness their magic. They were largely wiped out over the years and are now very rare and \\*very\\* hidden. A lot of people actually think they're extinct, and some don't believe they were ever anything more than legends and fairy tales. The discovery of one would be a big deal, and among nations that are in conflict, having something like that in their arsenal would give the holder quite an edge.\n\nI would like to play a young Wyv either in captivity by one such nation, or on the run from it, and I'm looking for someone to build his/her own \\*non-Wyv\\* character and collaborate on the world and story with me. I want you to have creative freedom with your character. The only thing I ask is that there be no human-animal hybrids, and no other Wyv. That would defeat the purpose.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nC. **Demon Seed (Medieval Fantasy):**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, the idea is that there's this one kind of magic that is seen as unholy and evil. It's also an exceedingly rare gift; someone is born with it only once every (insert large amount of time here). There is a legend and superstition surrounding them that says they're the descendants of a demon who in ancient times came and bred with mortal races to corrupt them and steal them away from their benevolent gods. These people are referred to as demon seeds and are both hated and feared. They're seen as bringers of death and misfortune. And over the eons, this view has been supported by the seeds - because being hated and mistreated will ruin people, and many of them became the villains everyone said they were.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girl will be the current seed, shrouded in superstition, trying to make sense of what she actually is and how the world sees her. I'd like to discuss more world- and story-building with my partner and leave the other character up to you entirely.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nD. **Inseparable (Medieval Fantasy):**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis one is actually the only one in which I'm not looking for romance. Rather, I'm looking for a deep platonic bond between my character, a sentient creature type, and yours, some sort of humanoid creation (the only races I'd like to avoid are the ones considered half creature/half human).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, bear with me, here. My character is a half-demon (apparently I'm in a demonic mood?) tigress. There are two \"clans,\" for lack of a better word, of feline creatures that are more than just wild animals. They're bigger, they're sentient, they can \"speak\"; think of them as more spirit creatures than animals. I gave them ridiculously corny names eight years ago when I came up with this, so I'm not going to embarrass myself by putting them here - but essentially, the panthers are bad, and the tigers are...considerably more benevolent. You do not want to run into a panther at the best of times; you only have to worry about a tiger if you've wronged them or the lands they protect. Panthers are demon-cats, like one of my tabbies would be if she had supernatural abilities. If it helps, I'll call the tigers the angels. Guardian spirits, more like.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo. My character is the product of mixed parentage. Her mother was a tiger; her father was a panther. Don't ask how that happened. The world is not black and white. She lost her mother as a cub, however, when poachers raided the glen her kind called home and pretty much wiped them out (my guess is they had some help, if you know what I mean). I would like to find someone to play a character who finds this little mystical fuzzball, \"raises her,\" probably without either of them really knowing what she is, and thus creates such a sweet, timeless bond of friendship.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe could either start with their meeting and then time-skip to adulthood a few years later, or start with adulthood. Beyond that, the challenges they face, the rest of the story, any baggage of your character's own to bring into play - that's all open and up for discussion. It's just the relationship and my own character I have.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nE. **Wishes &amp; Whims (Flexible):**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I had a dream last night, and it's led me to doing some plotting and musing today. I'd like to do something involving a genie, of sorts - only not exactly the typical \"three wishes\" deal. I envision young female spirit sort of being, trapped by some great power and freed by a young man, who then becomes her \"master.\" Now, I'm not talking about \\*that\\* kind of master, so kindly get your mind out of the gutter. She would attach to him; want to do things for him and make him happy; protect him at all cost. It may be that once, these beings were in partnership with humanity (and/or other mortal races); a soul link would be created between two individuals who were compatible, and they would fight together, with the human(oid) channeling the spirit's energy. I'm thinking that there are certain people who are \\*born\\* with the innate ability to link with them. Perhaps humanity began taking advantage of this partnership/pact system, however, and began using the links to conquer instead of just protect. So, most of them abandoned humanity and refuse to pact now - but she didn't. She still believes, and is waiting for her soulmate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOr maybe she's just extremely grateful to be freed. I kind of like pact systems, and a bond growing out of that, but I'm totally open to discussion and brainstorming, too! It's just a rough idea I pulled out of the air, anyway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nF. **Fish Out of Water (Realistic/Fantasy):**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(Note: This is probably the lowest on my preference list. I've had a few attempts to start it, but it always sort of falls flat. So I'd love to get a really good version going, but I'm a little discouraged about it. Keep that in mind.)\n\nThis is kind of a mix of modern realistic and medieval fantasy settings. It involves a young man from the \"real\" world (our world), and a girl from another world entirely; a world with magic and knights and medieval kingdoms. However, unlike your typical, patriarchal systems, her homeland recognizes equal female authority, as well as female knights and warriors. The world from which she hails is currently under threat of cataclysm, and the girl in question is one of those warriors. Though young, she was tracking down some magical doo-dad to help her country turn the tide of impending doom, but she was intercepted by a powerful sorcerer on the other side. There was a fight, and in the commotion, the artifact was destabilized, and there was an accident. She (along with the object) got dumped into another realm. Boom. Earth. She has no idea where she is, or how to navigate this odd place and its even odder customs.\n\nEnter your character. Whether he's some plain 9-to-5-er, or something more interesting - that's up to you. It may even turn out he's some special, prophesied hero in her world and doesn't know it. The point is the comedy, frustration, and emotion of the fish out of water situation. If you've seen the movie, Enchanted, you can see an example of that - though I'm not intending to play a giddy, stereotypical Disney princess. She's fiery and determined. I do want a bond to form between them, though. And eventually, I think it would even be cool to take the RP back into \\*her\\* world, where \\*he's\\* the one floundering,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nG. **Reverse Phantom of the Opera (Paranormal or Fantasy):**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I've finally seen the show, and I love it, but I'm not looking for a direct copy.  It simply serves as the inspiration for an idea I had; I'd like to change up the genders (i.e. female phantom) and potentially make her \\*actually\\* a ghost of sorts, or some other kind of being, \"haunting\" the theater. It's really just a rough, vague concept, but it's open to all kinds of discussion and interpretation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nH. **Post-Apocalyptic:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't really have any specifics on this; it's more a general genre. However, I do not want zombies. I want something more sci-fi and dystopian than horror or fantasy. Ruined civilizations, humanity struggling to survive... That kind of thing. Rating rules \\*still\\* apply here, though!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI. **Paranormal Collaboration:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTalking actual ghosts, here, not just things flying off shelves a la corny ghost hunting \"documentaries.\" I'd love to play a ghost against a human. Skillet's song, \"Lucy,\" inspired me a bit here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJ. **Science Fiction Collaboration:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also love sci-fi and am happy to come up with an idea together. Except for my Star Trek love (Voyager), though, I'm not interested in space travel. I like artificial intelligence subjects and futuristic things, but not really keen on aliens and interstellar ambling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also have a vague inkling of an idea that came from Nickelback's Lullaby! More fantasy, potentially a modern setting but could be medieval. Could even also be sci-fi. It has a lot of potential for emotion and conflict and development. Ask me about it!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\~\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n...That was really long. I apologize. Hopefully, I didn't lose *all* of you to my incessant rambling. If you're still with me, please feel free to PM me. I **don't** respond to comments, so please use the PM function. Thanks!",

            "selftext": "  \n\nHello everyone!\n\nThank you for taking some time to check out my post! Currently I have come across some time in my life to refocus on a passion of mine in writing and am looking for a partner to explore some ideas with! I am on the east coast of the US and generally RP throughout the day sparingly or more so at night. I believe myself to be literate with a focus on quality over quantity. That said I\u2019m pretty good at matching lengths but prefer multi-paragraph writing when possible. I\u2019ve been creatively writing for many moons but online RP\u2019ing for a little over a year \u2013 truthfully with little success in long term stories though most times it\u2019s my schedules fault.\n\nI write exclusively in third person and am open to more or less any genre except fandoms \u2013 though I am open to exploring established worlds as long as the characters are original within them. My personal favorites, however, revolve around medieval / high fantasy and modern day with focuses on action / adventure, character development, and typically slow-burn romances.  That said, I am open to other genres or focuses if the story is intriguing. I like characters to have quirks and faults that define them versus an invincible / god complex that sometimes happens. I also enjoy playing NPC\u2019s and doubling when necessary and prefer help on that front from partners. \n\nAs for story, I don\u2019t have any prompts currently as much as characters I enjoy playing and can share them with you based on the genre we choose to write. Ideally, my partner would be able to push story along with unexpected twists as I often implore those myself. I\u2019m very open and encourage OOC chat as being friends with my partners makes the RP\u2019ing more enjoyable overall. I am also open to nsfw themes and writing in any degree of detail given they fit the story and the characters and aren\u2019t the sole purpose of the writing. That said, I would need a partner 18+ at the least to write such themes. \n\nI think that\u2019s all, so if you\u2019re interested please shoot me a message, preferably with an idea or character in mind to chat about and explore!  \n\n\n\\-Side Note- If we've talked before / fell out due to my schedule or availability I apologize! Feel free to message me if you'd like to try again :)",

I'll let you create your own character and we will see where we can take the rp after we discuss and share our characters.

Also, you should be able to rp as NPC's as well (so will I)\n\nThe Rp\u2019s I want to try:\n\u2022 World War 2\n\u2022 Homeless Girls (my character)\n\u2022 College Band Rp\n\n\nThanks for reading and I hope you are interested in roleplaying together, please write your fav colour at the title of your message so I'll know you read it all the way through the text and not just spamming.\n\nBye~",

            "selftext": "Hello every one! I would usually post a prompt or a started, but I\u2019ve just thought I would rather speak to people. I\u2019m craving a role play in the Elder Scrolls universe. I would not call myself very knowledgeable about the lore, but I am fairly competent, I think. \nAnyway, in particular, I\u2019m looking to play a Vampire hunter. I\u2019m looking to play a Knight in particular. And I would hope to be paired off against a mage type. (This is of course not a requirement, only an idea.) \nI did have an idea for a plot, essentially, a few decades after the events of TESV, a vampire clan begins getting bolder and bolder around Skyrim. We could use the volkihar, or another lore clan, or make up our own. It should also, be mentioned, cannon and lore are not gospel, and if we\u2019d like to change something, I\u2019m more than ok with that. \n\nI do think that\u2019s the extent that I have as far as the plot goes. I want this to be dark and heavy, therefore dark themes will be included. And I would like to include the occasional smut scene, as well as sexual tension, themes and other NSFW things. That said, I ask that you only contact me if you are over the age of 18. I have very little thematic limits, and would love to hear yours as we talk. \nI\u2019d like to play on discord, though I think we should speak through reddit PMs for a while before we begin. \n\nI can write between two to four paragraphs per response. I\u2019d say semi literate, with good grammar and a decent vocabulary. I try to respond more than once a day, though that isn\u2019t possible from time to time. \n\nSo yes, I think that\u2019s all, if you have any question, or are interested in making up a plot to play out, do not hesitate to PM me, I\u2019m in GMT -5 time zone, and am available through most of the day.",

            "selftext": "*(NOTE: Our Roleplay is based on the world of Avatar the Last Airbender but there are no characters from the series in this roleplay. The roleplay consists entirely of original characters so there is no need to have seen Avatar to roleplay in our world. As long as you can get a hold of the lore when you start then you can roleplay with us effectively)\n\n~~Hello there.~~\n\nFlameo, Hotman!\n\nI know this likely isn't the first time you've seen threads about an ATLA/TLOK themed roleplay. Many roleplays in our fandom have come and gone, but mostly gone. They never seem to last more than a few months, sometimes barely even weeks. With respect to the current roleplays out there I think it's because they're getting something wrong\u2014several somethings actually. I believe some key aspects regarding my server will give it longevity:\n\n* *Firstly: The owner\u2014that's me\u2014has invested too much into this to drop it easily. A lot of roleplays don't seem to take very long to start up. An owner starts a discord server, puts some channels up, makes a template for characters, and opens up the roleplay. What took him thirty minutes to create will take him thirty seconds to get bored of and drop without a word as to why he disappeared. I've spent many, many, many hours working on this project and from what few posts I have made about the roleplay it seems to have generated a lot of interest in others besides just myself.*\n\n* *Secondly: The roleplays I have seen are all the same roleplay. They all feature the same template and usually the same setting in Republic City. There is nothing to make the roleplay stand out from the rest. My roleplay has that! It's got lots of that! I want my roleplay to be for literate writers and roleplayers with an interest in a D&amp;D style. There will be quests. There will be character progression. There will be dueling, politicking, and backstabbing. There will also be adventure as there should be in an ATLA/TLOK roleplay. More on all of this later in this post.*\n\n* *Thirdly: None of the roleplays I have seen have a story besides \"TOTAL SANDBOX DO WHATEVER YOU WANT!\" I think this makes the roleplay sizzle out of the player's interest more than any of the other things I mentioned. Having a good story\u2014an optional story\u2014for those who want it is essential. ATLA and TLOK have a story with heroes and villains, so why shouldn't a roleplay in the fandom also have a story, heroes, and villains? The story of the Four Elements Roleplay will be a grand one.*\n\nIn true Avatar style I'll let The Northern Water Tribe Chief Aippaq give you an intro to our world.\n\n**When I was a boy my father told me stories of the Avatar. They were fables to me\u2014grandiose legends of a fictional hero from some folktale. Only when I turned fifteen did I see the Avatar in the flesh. They weren't seven feet tall, but I still looked up to them; they couldn't kill men with their stare alone, but my heart stopped when they looked at me; they didn't fight shoulder-to-shoulder with spirits, but they fought alongside me. It has been 30 years since the disappearance of my wife\u2014the disappearance of the Avatar. There has been no new Avatar since. Where once my father told his children of a heroine known as the Avatar who fought off armies, prevented crime by the mention of her name, and kept our world in balance; now I tell my children\u2014our children\u2014of a time of pestilence, war, famine, and death without the Avatar\u2014without any Avatar. No single person can save our world from calamity, and no single person can bring our world to an end. The fate of this world lies in the hands of every one of us, whether we want it to or not. I believe we can save the world.**\n\nIt's probably important to stress that the Avatar will not be a playable character. I believe this is best because making the Avatar a player character essentially makes that person the main character and makes them too OP. I don't want that. This RP is about the non-Avatars of the world. It's also important to point out that our RP starts many years before Aang's story begins, so far that you won't run into any characters from the TV series. Every character is entirely original in this RP.\n\nHopefully I've hooked you somewhere by now.\n\nAs evidence of how much work has gone into this server, I'll dump every interesting aspect about our server here:\n\n* [ATLA Universe map recreation using Wonderdraft](https://www.easyzoom.com/imageaccess/f4f17bbfbf2f4f35a30b5fe8a164a7dc)\n\n* [The fighting mechanics of our server](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bXhK1x_t_o_loqxwyivMUcaV2HDudI4_VM6ssdBDJvU/edit)\n\n* [The \"Skills/Gifts/Curses\" we use for character progression](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zoiawPEuBjOMAW52iEMHzuVrxu5Q4JFFKdE1NDtiX-8/edit)\n\n* Unique mechanics for all five nations. In summary, the Water Tribes have a \"Tradition\" mechanic, the Earth Kingdom has a \"Fame\" mechanic, the Fire Nation has an \"Honor\" mechanic, and the Air Nomads have a \"Spirituality\" mechanic. All mechanics have their own pros and cons. Here they are if you want to look at them in more depth: [Northern Water Tribe](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UUhwQN4ysnJ8BdnSydETOy6ZOcyJJSbq8OYn47xlwBU/edit) | [Southern Water Tribe](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sAjSGhbSYzcgM9cGiJsaYlhtnovVNxfL_SjQCw9iU9k/edit) | [Earth Kingdom](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mUPGEkHKz8ZkzF4Mv7pIs0hoFA8UX-VtMJaDyJWT0KU/edit) | [Fire Nation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19LVxVVC1VnN-7v-dmfzZbq9c3f9t36YpWwHk4EHZmyc/edit) | [Air Nomads](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sIwHRz3rZcC7gC60gsaiiMbv4gEzRTGWSf8JqAZE-CA/edit)\n\n* [A total of 327 abilities for your characters to use in battle if they have the right \"proficiency\" for it and are the right bending or fighting type. There is room for a hypothetical infinite amount of custom user-made abilities if \"scrolls\" are found during the roleplay.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bdh4_V-nI85aq-vDH_0GEvmn_RnKDFm1DqqU4asRBMQ/edit#gid=1861128591)\n\n**That's everything that I have finished and ready to go for Monday. There are plenty of other mechanics that I have on the menu but in a state of delay for now until I'm able to figure out how to best implement them such as a War System, resources and recipes(both of those two should be done come this Monday anyway).**\n\nThat might not be everything I have to offer you, but for this thread it will have to do. On our server there are other unique things to generate interest in roleplay such as pictures and descriptions of every one of our 125 roleplay channels, a \"Bounty Board\" system, a way for users to make custom quests and you can expect me to make story quests for people to partake in as well. If any of this sounds like it might be your thing then don't hesitate to join our server, leave a comment, or drop me a DM. When you join the server, and after you've gotten a good grasp of the mechanics and rules, you should drop an RP sample into the appropriate channel so you can be given a writer role and then move on to creating your characters which I will start accepting Monday when the RP officially opens.\n\nHere is the link to our server: https://discord.gg/UQz8M84\n\n**I hope to see some of you there! Thanks!**",

I'm looking for a partner to play out a prompt I've done in the past.\n\nThe year is 2072. The world is in crisis. The frequency and intensity of natural disasters is rapidly on the rise, placing billions in danger. Earthquakes shake the western US on a nearly daily basis. Coastal cities like New York, Miami and Boston are constantly threatened by storms and flooding, forcing many to evacuate. Northern parts of the country freeze over during the winter, month-long blizzards burying cities in feet of snow. Humanity seems to be on the back foot against Mother Nature. One day, however, a savior arrives. Two, actually. A young man and a young woman appeared with control over the elements. They're able to stop storms in their tracks. The earth becomes still under their command. It seems as if humanity has a chance thanks to their new saviors.\n\nSo, that's the basic premise. In the past, my partner and I held opposite elements, like the male having fire and the woman having water. We could stick with the primary four elements, or expand them to things like the sun and moon, etc. I'm planning for this to be a bit dystopian with twists and turns. I'd love to hear advice and suggestions if you're interested. PM me and we can chat there. Thanks!",

            "selftext": "Hello out there!  \nI'm a 19 year old female from the cold North looking for someone to do some longterm roleplays on Discord. \n\nRegarding genre and plot I am very open minded and I prefer brainstorming with my partner to figure out a plot that suits the both of us as good as possible. I have done a ton of different kinds of roleplays, but of course I am more comfortable in some than others. Always open to learning and trying new stuff, though. What I've done most would be slice of life, fantasy, sci-fi and post apocalypse. I have to admit I am not too interested in roleplays consisting of too much lore, as I'm easily confused. \n\nI can roleplay as both female and male and if it's suitable for the roleplay, more characters at once. Moving on to characters, I have a great devotion to my characters and I love playing with different kind of characteristics in all sorts of ways. It's not a demand for me to include romance/smut, but I like having it included in some sort of way, but it's not necessary at all.   \n\n\nMy greatest preference in roleplays will be an exciting plot - I am not interested in a plot that's loosely based off of a few keywords, nor am I interested in playing with characters that doesn't have any interesting qualities to them. I like drama, action and sometimes melancholy included. Not that it should be action all the time, but it gets boring if it's not progressive in some type of way. This also means that I like character evolvement, meaning that our characters don't stay the same through the entire roleplay.  \n\n\nWhen I am in the roleplay, the length of my replies will vary depending on the situation. If the scene solely consists of dialogue and minor movement, I won't have much to work with and therefore it will be harder for me to form out longer sentences. (English is not my first language) I will always try my best to be descriptive and I don't expect you to have perfect grammar/spelling. It's the content of what you write that matters to me.   \n\n\nConsidering the more practical stuff, I am in timezone GMT+0, I ask you to please respect and not spam me with messages if I don't reply - I have a life besides being on my computer. Of course this goes both ways, I won't bother you if you're busy. I enjoy smalltalk on the side as well, as I think it's important to get to know my partner. If you're not comfortable with this, no problem!  \n\n\nIf I somehow managed to keep your attention to this point and you're interested, please message me and we can discuss further! :)",

I'm looking for a partner for a character dynamic rather than an outright plot. \n\nWe will be discussing and coming up with one together, with this idea in mind: a couple where the woman is a prodigious but \"difficult\" man's very competent second-in-command and just about the only person who can deal with his antics and/or see beyond this persona he puts up around others. As the title implies, I will be playing said woman and you said man.\n\nThink Roy Mustang and Riza Hawkeye, Varrick and Zhu Li or Tony Stark and Pepper Potts.\n\nSetting-wise, I'm pretty much open to anything, military, slice-of-life, fantasy, you name it.\n\nNow, the romance between them will be strictly slow burn, as in, we will take time to flourish and/or be consummated. We can even not make it the central theme, if you'd prefer, but just an important aspect of our characters' journey.\n\nRequirements are as follows: \n- we will be using anime/manga as our aesthetic, but don't expect stuff to be overly unrealistic because of it, unless that's your sort of thing\n- you must write at least a solid paragraph and have decent grammar and spelling\n- but most importantly, you must put the effort to plan the story, characters and setting g with me, be it by pitching in your ideas or just agreeing/disagreeing with mine, no \"sure\" or \"you can choose\"\n\nIf you're interested in giving this a shot, please shoot me a message so we can exchange Discords.",

            "selftext": "Once again, I find myself looking for a partner to collaborate with. Things seem to always fizzle out due to life, but always amicably. But I never stop trying.\n\nI always have loads of ideas knocking around in my brain. Hopefully at least one catches your eye! Most of these I've conceived a general idea for already and I would love to share them with you all if you're interested. Really though, I can get along with most anything and have many many more ideas in my noggin apart from these. The following is just my general go-to when looking for new partners.\n\n\n\n\n-Police detective/an almost victim to the most notorious serial killer around. I was thinking 1940s/1950s ish for this one. My character somehow got away from the killer and turns to your character for help.\n\n\n\n-The d\u00e9butant/lowly worker. I was thinking 1890s for this one. I thinking two different things for this one. Either it takes place in New York among high society or maybe my incredibly rich father decided to move us out west to some small town in hopes of expanding his business. Your character could be whatever you wanted as long as there is an obvious class divide.\n\n \n\n-The Immigrant Girl. So, picture the movie Brooklyn. That's what I have in mind here. Essentially, 1950s-ish, a girl moves to New York from another country and falls in love with a local guy. In the movie, she's Irish and he's Italian but any combination is grand by me. We can really make this one whatever we want it to be and don't need to follow the movie.\n\n\n\n-Popular girl/nerdy guy. Definitely a slice of life role. The two grew up next to each other and were best of friends ever since they were small. Things changed when high school came around and the two went down two very different paths.\n\n \n\n-Innocent church girl/bad boy. Another slice of life role. The innocent girl is new in town. Her father was just hired on at a local church as the new pastor. She begins to attend the local high school and catches the eye of a character who's a bit unsavory, at least at first glance. His reputation speaks volumes. Another scenario could involve him being her tutor in college. Now, that would create some issues straight out the door.\n\nPrincess/suitor: The princess is to ascend to the throne in just a few short weeks due to unforeseen incidents. In order to claim this bloodline right, she needs to find a suitable man to marry and rule with. Is the suitor the sly and mysterious prince of an enemy kingdom? The golden boy of the oldest kingdom of tales? Maybe the weathered and scarred prince of a battle-torn warring kingdom? A were-creature or an elf? So many other possibilities!\n\n\n\nHopefully something tickles your fancy. I'm rather easy going. I'm sure even if you aren't into any of these, we could find something that works for both of us. I'll stay tuned. :) Also, if it isn't clear, I don't want this to be an entirely sex-driven piece. I like substance, plot, character development and such. \n\nLet's discuss.",

            "selftext": "**The story part**    \nI have quite fond memories of roleplaying in a Soul Eater (anime) universe. More specifically, I would like to write again in a Meister/Weapon context. Essentially, two very different people meeting, learning about each other, learning to fight together, going on adventures, becoming close friends. I\u2019d like it if one of them had a darker aspect to their personality, just so we could have some conflict. Alternatively, I\u2019m happy if your character was someone else rather than a partner, such as a mentor-like figure, or even a friendly witch.     \n\n**The practical parts**    \nNo smut, no romance (one-sided is ok), no GoT-/Berserker-level adult or dark themes.    \nFor Weapons/Meisters, I\u2019d prefer 18 to 30, and having our characters within a few years of each other.\nI write slowly. Waiting multiple days is pretty typical, with the occasional week or more. The fastest I can do is once a day.    \nI write in multi-paragraph format. My average is about 500-700 words per post, but I can comfortably go higher or lower depending on the situation and my rp partner\u2019s style. However, I cannot go comfortably under two paragraphs or over 2000 words (occasionally, yes, but not repeatedly).    \nI\u2019m not saying you have to do the same, but please try to write at least two paragraphs. ^^\nThe platform I prefer is googledocs.        \n\n**The new part aka I have no idea what I\u2019m doing**    \nI\u2019d like to test another way of doing things, if you\u2019ll indulge me.    \n\nFrankly, I\u2019m a bit tired of sorting through messages, putting effort into calculating how many threads I can afford to invest my time in, discussing plot in detail and then ending up with far fewer threads than I originally imagined (largely due to ghosting).    \n\nSo instead, I\u2019ll post two prompts. One for my Weapon character, another for my Meister. If you\u2019re interested, just shoot me a PM for one of them with what you\u2019d write in reply! I\u2019m putting a limit of 500 words max at first, because I don\u2019t want to pressure people too much. No need to hurry. I\u2019m happy to discuss details ooc too.    \n\nMy weapon character starts out as a Kishin Egg. That pretty much marks her out as a target to be killed; however, her Weapon abilities are also awakening. Hypothetically, that could stop the development of her madness; however, who would trust her at this point? That\u2019s where your character comes in. Presumably the story would start out with some sort of fight, then redemption arc, a la Crona.    \n\nOn the opposite, my Meister character is fairly normal. However, I\u2019d prefer it if her partner was the one with the dark aspect. Maybe a ninja that wishes to serve their family, even in more morally grey or outright black ways? Maybe a bloodthirsty berserker? Maybe a stuck-up noble? My character could provide a supportive shoulder and a moral compass, while learning that the world is more complex than she wishes, and that sometimes caring about people is difficult.    \n\n**Weapon prompt**    \n(warning: rather dark themes in terms of graphic violence)\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1aHhCizFCIHhJx0d2drLPmDiJBOXTII8MVDN4M1lE0RY/edit?usp=sharing\n \n\n**Meister prompt**    \nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1Sm3LPJpZnP2zk9m4G8Z1p1BTN2uD9AsdptlNhBtmcso/edit?usp=sharing\n\nPlease send a PM if interested (no reddit chat; I use OldReddit)!",

The Democratic Free City of Luskan had fallen victim to rebellion, after the death of its long-reigning High Councillor from natural causes.\n\nWill you manage to rise above the infighting and the political blur, or fall victim to it? In this story, there is no plot armor, and there are no completely good heroes nor completely bad villains. There are only people.

            "selftext": "I am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+ \n\nHello, my name is Allen, and i love history! From the ancient river valleys to the most lewd medieval rulers, i love them all. I wanted to roleplay a storyline that i came up with, and it will have a heavy historical influence.\n\nYour character: This story will center on you, a young but highly capable princess. At a time when no one imagined that a woman could rule a state, you seized the reigns if the kingdom magnificently, turning it from a small kingdom into a regional power. In the process though, you have to put down a few rebellions, and this is where my character comes in. I lead a rebel army and wreak havoc in your state as soon as i hear about your fathers death. Expecting an easy win, you defeat me and lock me away, deciding to show me mercy because i showed you a bit of chivalry.\n\nThis is when the plot gets dicey. A neighboring kingdom decides that they want what is yours, and invade the kingdom. You realize that only with my help can you defeat such a large and powerful army and unite your people. We slowly learn to respect each other, and both prove ourselves as capable leaders, maybe even becoming lovers in the process.\n\n\nThe setting: A bit more about the setting, this story will be set in a small kingdom called Galitia, and your people are called the Galitians. The capital of your kingdom is called Valle\u00e9, a rich town with a castle at its center. Its in the eastern part of the kingdom. Across your kingdom runs a river called the Laugus river, and to the west lies a castle called Eagles Nest. Controlling this castle gives you control over the west. Neighboring your kingdom is a powerful empire called the Alemanic confederacy. Your father, the now dead king, paid tribute to his empire in order to keep them from invading. Since this is medieval, know that most of the kingdom wont respect you on account of your gender. The story will start with your fathers death. The Nobles will push the country to the brink of civil war over who gets to succeed him, as he had no son, only you, his illegitimate daughter. You will take power with the help of your advisor. Some of the Nobles and knights will rebel against you, and how you deal with them is up to you.\n\nThe setup: each storyline will be a season/volume and will be roleplayed in a group chat, (just you and me) our dms will be for discussing anything outside the rp. There will also be a group for alternate storylines or character one shots just to make the universe feel bigger. This other group doesn't have to be used.\n\nThere a few plot twists that i wanna save for the actual rp, the time period can be any you would like, (i would prefer medieval Europe or the middle east) and i would be happy to discuss other matters of the rp if you like! I am also not looking for someone who wants to act like they have no idea how to run a kingdom for the sake of drama, I have had partners do that already, and my god was it annoying. If you like certain aspects of this roleplay but not others, please text me anyway, we can definitely compromise! Hope to hear from you soon!\n\nText me if interested! Thank you for taking the time to read this!",

            "selftext": "We are a Fantasy group with multiple regions, kingdoms, and groups within the group. We have magic, dragons, and custom species (and custom races) to encounter. Medicael takes place in a realm named \"Medomne\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn our group, your character can do whatever they want. We even have some major positions that need filled in, such as kings, bandit leaders, bandit gang members, and guards. You and your characters can even have your own groups within the group. Make unique story for your characters and possibly even affect the current lore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have no character limit. Bring and make as many as you want! You can also be whatever you want as long as it follows the rules.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are 8 regions;\n\nNorth Province, the smallest civilization ruled by a cold-hearted king who has banned all forms of magic. They tend to stay secluded, only involving themselves with other kingdoms when they're angry.\n\nProvectus, the largest and most advanced kingdom. They have ships of steel and advanced weaponry, such as guns. However, their king has vanished along with their griffin guardian.\n\nPhantom's Isles, a bunch of Isles controlled by three different gangs. Surprisingly, the area still seems to be a functioning kingdom under the main gang's rules. Mostly functioning. The majority of anything living has been wiped out, Diablo being the last isle in the area with a forest and wildlife.\n\nPalus, a bunch of swampy islands and bogs with multiple leaders. Palus isn't very exciting.\n\nMisty Valley, some weird place full of mist and cat people. The \"people\" there are tribal, no humans naturally existing on the island.\n\nBandit's Den, a criminal's paradise. The Pirate Gang has control over the island, allowing bandits, thieves, and other trouble makers to set up base there away from the law. At least the current gang is allowing them to.\n\nSun's Spire, an island of sun-worshiping dwarves who've gone insane from drinking the water from the ocean. Their villages surround a mountainous ring that encloses a scorching desert. Risky adventurers often spend all of their money on gear, only to be eaten by the serpent hiding beneath the sands.\n\nAmini, a group of frozen isles that's completely off the grid and unknown to anyone outside of the area. The inhabitants are currently hiding in caves, trying to survive a blood thirsty beast whose only intent is to wipe out the humans and elves who live there. Amini does not exist on any maps, Aminians only know that the North Province exist after warring with them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease read the rules before joining our group!  [http://medicaelfhrp.proboards.com/board/4/rules](http://medicaelfhrp.proboards.com/board/4/rules) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Forum is for holding the group's info. The Discord is where RP and chatter takes place. (Also note that things are currently being updated. Check out the Discord's Announcements channel for that.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMore info on everything can be found here.

FIlled with silk and gold, he thinks he\u2019s it the jackpot, but in reality the gold and silks are a cover up. Aboard the ship is the Prince of the South.

            "selftext": "You had never known your mother. Dad often spoke of her though, that rare dreamy tone in his voice. A 'great and beautiful woman'. The \u2018Most intelligent person he had ever known\u2019 and \u2018as Kindhearted as a saint.\u2019 It was becoming difficult to continue believing that. She had to have been around for your birth of course, but as soon as you turned two she left you, as dad explains, and returned to her homeland far to the West. The Spirit Valley. Otherwise known as Elin Hal. Dad had made her out to be some kind of incredible, all powerful witch who was needed by her clan, she had a great duty to fulfil and leaving the sleepy island town you had spent your entire life on, leaving you, was a small sacrifice in the name of the greater good.\n\nStill, it would be difficult not to resent her. A childhood that had been stripped away before you even knew it. Dad had attempted to raise you on his own. A doctor by trade, a pleasant man, well respected by loyal patients within town. But a doctor has a lot of work and, despite his best attempts, for the most part you were left to your own devices. There wasn't much to do on the island nation of Hanstrasia. It was populous enough not be a wasteland, busy enough so that one could work as any job they wished as long as they were qualified. But nothing seemed to happen. One would go through school, attend college, get a job, find a partner, get married... It was a simple stable uneventful existence. And that was how you always thought it would be.\n\nUntil you received the letter. A request to meet, sent from your mother, who signed the brief document by the name Cecile Vengi. It was the first time you had experienced her actions directly. After much debate and encouragement from dad, who didn't seem to mind Cecile had changed her last name, you decided to rent passage on a merchant airship to the mainland and travel to the Spirit Valley, the famous, but distant, pilgrimage site. The homeland of witches.\n\nAs soon as you left your boring but safe island things started going wrong. The crew who maintained the airship proved to be lazy and uncooperative with you. The 'War of the Lions' between the great democratic Northern Federation and expansionist Southern Empire had spread to the east of the mainland and the fear of winding up in the hands of either nation had petrified the crew. To make matters even worse, you had just been boarded by pirates. Or at least, you thought you had. rustling and shouting from up on deck and foreign, unfamiliar tongues echoed through the steel corridors of the airship. The vessel itself had slowed, merely floating sluggishly within the sky, a desperate attempt at escape seemingly halted. Out the port hole window you could see a small, streamlined black vessel, its float dust vents emitting a slight purple haze. A triplet of winch harpoons preventing any hope of your merchant ship from breaking away, and even then, it would have been quite impossible to outrun the pirate hunter.\n\nLeft alone in the sky, nothing but the open ocean several thousand feet beneath you, the world seemed totally silent for a brief moment. Then the unmistakable sound of footsteps crept faintly from behind your cabin\u2019s door.\n\n-\n\nHello! I posted this advert two weeks ago and got many responses. Unfortunately, exams stopped me from pursuing it as much as I thought I would be able to. Now that my schedule is clearer I thought I would post again.\n\nI am looking for a partner to RP with on discord. The RP would revolve around the story of an 18 year old woman in a fantasy world on a journey to meet her mother for the first time. Along the way she would meet many interesting characters, discover much more about the world she inhabits, and solve the mysteries surrounding her mother. To a certain extent this is a coming of a age story, with a young woman leaving her home for the first time, discovering what kind of person she is and what kind of person she might become.\n\nI normally write two or three paragraphs a response and can ordinarily make one response a day.\n\nWe shall discuss your character and how the roleplay is going to work over discord.\n\nI eagerly await to hear from you.",

            "selftext": "Most of the time, you'd never give your shadow a second thought. You wouldn't give any shadow thought unless you were scrambling for some shade on a hot summer's day. They're convenient in some cases, but for the most part you would never really put intense cranial power into interpreting them beyond that. Why would you? A shadow is merely the blockage of light to a surface, after all. I'm going to fill you in on a secret though...\n\nYour shadow thinks a lot about you.\n\nEverything is connected, few more so than Light and Darkness. It's a constant ebb and flow between the two battling for dominance. Most of you are familiar with the World of Light, it's where we exist after all. We eat, we sleep, we laugh. This is what we call a normal life, for most sane people anyways. However, what if I told you the tales of the World of Darkness? How things parallel and differ between the two extremities?\n\nLight is warm, joyous, and luxurious. You know it well enough, you've lived it this whole time. Darkness? It's cold, barren, and depressing. Yet just like you, people, or creatures, live in this world. They eat just like you and they sleep just like you. There is one key difference though. Actually, make that two.\n\nYou see, the inhabitants of the World of Darkness aren't humans. They are accumulations of Darkness given a spirit, and for them, their life is far from luxurious. Their days are filled with battles for survival, a yearning for light. The World of Darkness is dangerous, and life for these \"Shadows\" is a terrible existence. Things have been like this for billions of years, with Shadows struggling to maintain the kinds of lives human take for granted.\n\nSomething strange has been happening lately though. Occasionally, a Shadow will catch a glimpse of a strange and gentle world, one that almost overlaps their own reality...one filled with hope, warmth, and love. It's almost as if they can touch it...if only they just tried a little...just little bit harder!\n\nAnd that's how, by a twist of fate, you met me.\n\nWew, thanks for reading all that word vomit! I've long thought about a world like this and how interesting it would be to play out a relationship between the inhabitants. Of course, a lot of this is still very much up for debate and changing, but this was the basic premise. I'm one of the \"Shadows\" and you're a normal human. Slowly the lines between our worlds begin to blur, and we together have to deal with the consequences of that. Are other Shadows not as kind as me? Are they plotting to overrun the World of Light? Is there a dimensional portal we have to close? I'm open to suggestions!\n\nSo, a little about myself. I'm a 23 year old Male who has been writing for close to 13 years. I love it, and would love to write something where we can build a story and develop characters and relationships. I'm typically most active towards the tail end of the week, but can usually get a reply or some OOC talk in during. I enjoy detailed, literate writers who can churn out 1-2 paragraphs in response. I try to match to my partners, but if there isn't a decent amount to read I don't get enough mental stimulation to want to put much effort in. For this prompt I'd like some romance in it because I'm a sucker for this kind of stuff, and I also don't care about your IRL gender provided you can write.\n\nAnyways, thanks for coming to my Ted Talk about shadow people and how they're ruining our society, hope to hear from you soon!",

            "selftext": "**Hi!**\n\nMy name is Meulin! You can call me whatever you'd like, though. I'm interested in a whole slew of things but the topmost things will be listed below. Before we get into what I wanna do, though, we should probably get into what I'm like, and what I want in a partner.\n\nRequirements:\n\n- Typically, I can do either gender and don't have specific preferences both gender and sexuality wise in my roleplays, so I expect the same from my partner. I don't wanna make you abide, nor abide by, anyone's character rules. That doesn't mean I'll be okay with you making all of one type of character all the time (IE. Rich Girl, Badass dude, etc) if we end up doing more than one roleplay\n\n- I'm open minded but I'm not that open minded. So, yeah, I'll do certain NSFW topics but I'm not going to do a whole bunch of stuff. Same goes for your characters. If you wanna make them unique, go right on ahead, but if we're going to be doing a roleplay about the 1840's I don't want you to try using a furry OC (Or something with cat ears). Basically, what I'm trying to say is if you wanna do something super outlandish, please talk to me first to see if I'm okay with it. Don't try anything with anthros or cat-eared anime girls, please. Those are the only common things I've ran into that I'm uncomfortable with, so those are definitely off the table for comfort reasons. Unless walking, talking animals are part of whatever setting we're in, it probably won't be on the table. I just gotta draw the line at some point.\n\n- I write. A lot. Now, that doesn't mean that I'm gonna sit there and take ages to write, but I'll take a little long for obvious reasons. That being said, my post length as well as my amount of posts depends on my partner. You give me a long turn? I give you a long turn. You plan on posting 6 or 7 times in a day? I'll make sure to respond to those posts.\n\n- That being said, I don't want to write a long turn and then get three sentences back. I'm looking for someone who can write 300, sometimes 1000 word turns frequently and without pushing themselves. I want someone who can match me, here.\n\n- I'm partial to writing in a script based format, using bold letters for actions and such. That being said, I also write in Para and I'm sure I can try matching however you write! The only thing for my style that is a constant is being third person, past tense.\n\n- I only use Discord Servers! Meaning, obviously, I'll only be using Discord for the roleplaying platform. It's\u00a0organised, easy to keep maintained, and all that good stuff. So, if you're not interested in that, or don't want to try it, then I\u2019m sorry to say we won't be compatible!\n\n- I'll be making the server for the roleplay, so don't worry about that. I'll have it covered, you just gotta have some patience with it because it might take me a little bit. \n\nNow that that's all out of the way (Though, knowing my luck I probably forgot something.), Let's get into what I'm interested in!\n\n- **The Legend of Zelda**! Unlike most of the other fandom roleplays listed in this ad, I'm actually **looking to roleplay as canon characters in this one**. That being said, it'd be in a slightly altered timeline of Breath of the Wild. If you wanna role-play some LOZ, don't hesitate to message me!\n\n- **Hey sixer! Oh, Wait. You're not Ford.** Another, newer Fandom roleplay I'm interested in. Gravity Falls! The weirdness, the exploration, the secrets! I have a few characters, and a journal of my own I've been working on, so we can have a lot of fun with this idea. **I don't plan on having the Pines be involved in this roleplay**, though, which I'll explain over DMs. Message me if you're interested.\n\n- **If I'm getting this right, you're telling me that you wanna hire me.. to hunt down an alien relic?** Borderlands 3 has gotten me craving some Borderlands inspired roleplay. So, if you're up for the action, mayhem and badassitude that comes with that type of setting, shoot me a message. I'll be more than happy to talk plot with you there!\n\n- **Cowboys. Outlaws. Honest men and not so honest ones, all around.** 'Course, the not so honest folk are a dying breed now. Red Dead Redemption (2 in specific), is a huge inspiration for this interest of mine. **I'm not looking to shy away from action in this roleplay**, that's for sure, so I'm not looking to play a ranch hand (unless they got roped into the story somehow). I'm looking for someone to be outlaws with, **so let's really tear the \"Land of opportunity\" a new one**!\n\n**Just because something isn't listed here doesn't mean I won't do it! If there's something you'd like to do, and you know you could write a lot for, message me about it we can discuss it!**\n\nAnyway, if you got here then **thank you for showing interest**. Send me a message and let me know what you're looking for, and we can go from there. If you can, attach a turn of yours. If you do attach a turn, make sure it accurately portrays you as a writer. Anyway, I can't wait to meet someone! **Peace**!",

I\u2019m looking for a roleplay partner interested in possibly roleplaying with me. \n\nI had in mind something like my character, a bunny-human hybrid, gets left at your character\u2019s (human) doorstep with a note. It basically says \u201cplease take care of me\u201d, and inside is my character in his bunny form. \n\nYour character decides to keep him, and quickly finds out that the little cute bunny is more than meets the eye. \n\n\nSome things to know: \n\n-I always reply as soon as I can. I would prefer it if you did too. \n\n-My replies vary in sizes, but is for the most part between 2-7 sentences. I see a lot of people wanting 2-3 paragraphs, and that is too much for me to keep up with. \n\n-English is not my first language, though I am semi-literate/literate. I don\u2019t mind if your grammar isn\u2019t the best, at this point I just want to roleplay with someone, lol. \n\n-My time zone is CEST (UTC/GMT +2 hrs). \n\n-I will always respect your limits. If there is something you\u2019re uncomfortable with, please tell me so. I will try to make sure not to bring it up. \n\n-I\u2019m up for everything. It does say non-sexual on the tag, but if you feel like it NSFW is okay with me too. \n\n-I don\u2019t mind which gender you play as. Do whatever you like! \n\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this! If you\u2019re interested, comment down below or message me and I\u2019ll give you my discord tag. \n\nThanks again!",

Once you join, you could go over the rules and ask any questions you have and I\u2019d be happy to answer. If you feel it\u2019s a server you\u2019d love to participate in then go ahead and stay, we\u2019re all friendly! You\u2019ll have the choice of being able to create your own character, your own custom type of magic, or the choice of playing as a canon character; it\u2019s up to you! All I really ask of you is that you\u2019re friendly, willing to roleplay with others, and are capable of typing at least a few lines of dialogue with each reply, one liners aren\u2019t fun at all. \n\nThe server is still being worked on, though by the time you create your own character and we get a few members in each squad(2 squads open as of right now), we should be ready to begin roleplaying!

I'm very sorry but not sorry enough to change it try to change that ;)\n- paragraph style, third person posts are my preferred style. \n- I really love world-building and brainstorming plots/twists together\n- I'll probably make playlists and Pinterest boards but you don't have to! \n\nI always have plot ideas but nothing that's ever fully set in stone. A large chunk of the roleplay fun for me is to create a story with the person I'm writing with. With that being said you're very free to ask me about my ideas and see if you like them or not. No big deal if you don't, we can always create something new. Of course I'm also super interested in your ideas and please feel free to share them! \n\nThemes I dig: \nFantasy, vampires, pirates, knights, witches, hunters, werewolves, historical fiction, rough personalities that secretly have a soft heart, royalty, arranged marriages, class differences, nyphs, class differences, cultural differences, little forest towns, big cities, folklore, magic and magicians, quests, soulmates, forbidden romance, musician, travel, sci fi, dragons, elves, rivals, enemies, post apocalyptic, supernatural, gifted or superheroes, western, fairytales \n\nFandoms\n(I only use the settings or as a source of inspiration. I'm honestly hopeless when it comes to canon X oc pairings and want to avoid bitter disappointment.) \n- Star Wars\n- Elfquest\n- X-Men\n- Grishaverse\n- Dragonriders of Pern\n- Game of Thrones\n- A court of thorns and roses\n- Attack on Titan\n- Pacific Rim\n- Full metal alchemist\n- Shadowhunters/ the mortal instruments",

I\u2019d probably reach out faster as well) I hope you all are having a great day and want to start out by saying thank you for checking out my post! I\u2019m looking for an 18+ male. Mostly because I like to have adult themes in my Roleplay to allow from some conflict and tension.\n\nSo just to start out with, here are some Genres I\u2019m into doing (just I heads up I don\u2019t do fandoms)\n\n-Fantasy (All Kinds)\n\n-Superhero \n\n-Mystery\n\n-Western\n\n-Sci-Fi\n\n-Slice of Life (if it has a really developed story)\n\nAnd there is one genre I won\u2019t do and that is Post Apoc. It\u2019s not my favorite and most likely won\u2019t do it.\n\nSome other things you should know is I am an artist so I usually draw most of my face claims, however I don\u2019t require you to have any face claims, descriptions are fine with me.\n\nResponses should be a paragraph or more. I tend to get lengthy with my responses which can be really fun if the partner is doing that as well!\n\nI am usually on 24/7 most of the time (PST.) However I only require my partners to at least post once a day, and if something comes up in life? Don\u2019t worry about it, just don\u2019t forget to tell me.\n\nLastly I just want to thank you again for reading! As I said I do like using discord, so send me a reply, and don\u2019t be shy!

A lot of the fun for me in writing is constantly adding to these three elements to keep it unpredictable and fun. Right?\n\nMy more recent main characters tend to be flawed anti-heroes, though I've played a broad spectrum of mains. Bonus points for you if you go something unorthodox.\n\nCurrent interests:\n\nMedieval fantasy (Always up for this.)\n\nNobility and courtly intrigue.\n\nSlice-of-life anime or action.\n\nCertain fandoms? I've only tried it once, but enjoyed it. Fire Emblem, the Tales series, the Witcher and so on could be fun.\n\nYour suggestions.\n\nDO:\n\nWrite multiple paragraphs when possible (excluding dialogue on its own.) As with most writers, I love beautiful description and try to include it in my posts when applicable. Like everyone else says though, quality over quantity.\n\nBe open to themes that explore the more sinful side of the human psyche.\n\nUse third person past tense.\n\nAsk for writing samples, if curious.\n\nDON'T:\n\nRush to get me a response. I understand life gets in the way sometimes.\n\nBe shy. Don't worry, I don't bite. \n\nYou can expect me to write 2/3 paragraphs per post. I post once a day at least, depending on my schedule--usually more.\n\nDiscord only, please. Though if you'd like to gauge things out through PM that's fine too.\n\nLet's get to writing.",

            "selftext": "Greetings and thank you for reading this. I\u2019ll start with a little about myself. I am a literate and experienced, mature-age roleplayer who has played across multiple platforms including chat, emails and even MMOs. My interests lie in both the small-scale character building and the large-scale worldbuilding that accompanies it.\n\nWhat I am looking for in a partner is somebody similar who has a similar approach to mine. I believe that two way communication is key to success in a RP relationship and that the players should not only engage with each other, but also feel free discuss and suggest plot, story and worldbuilding ideas.\n\nI am looking for something specific with regards to my character; I will be playing a FtM Trans character. What stage of their transition they are at is open to negotiation, but regardless they identify and present as female.\n\nI am interested in original worlds and settings based around Cyberpunk, Sci-Fi, Post-Apocalyptic and Low Fantasy genres. I have a few basic ideas I can work from for each of these, but I am also very much open to ideas and collaboratively building a world. I am not averse to including NSFW elements, but only as a part of the story, rather than for the simple sake of it.\n\nI prefer to play via email or Discord. If you are interested, please PM me. I will not reply to posts on this thread.",

I\u2019d like to do the following fandom worlds with OCs!\n\n**Gundam** \\- I would love to cobble together a simple space vs Earth sort of dilemma found in the Universal Century timeline. I'm also a big fan of **Zone of the Enders** and would love to include its suit designs.\n\n**Persona** \\- I've played both Persona 4 and 5. This would be mostly an action with some slice of life/drama elements here and there. I've totally made up a world and cast of characters, I just need some to go an adventure. I'd love for it to take place in Japan, but characters can be new transfers to the area if you're not familiar with the culture. I'm flexible about the story if that doesn't work for you.\n\n**Digimon** \\- I'd love to do something with original characters, in the vein of Tamers. However, I'll take stories based around Seasons 1 and 2 as well (teens go to Digital World, shenanigans ensue). I don't mind playing a digimon to a digidestined, or playing a digidestined/digimon opposite to another tamer/digimon duo.\n\n**Other scattered fandoms I am interested in, but have less concrete ideas for:** Mass Effect, Super Smash Brothers, and How to Train your Dragon. Heck, there might be ideas from fandoms I have not mentioned here that might be interesting. Just let me know.\n\n\\- **I tend to play characters who are dudes** and don\u2019t mind who you bring to the table.\n\n\\- I use **third person, past tense, paragraph style** when I roleplay. I'm on PST and try to post several times a day. I don't do kik, google docs, or reddit messages.\n\n\\- **I\u2019m not a stickler for length, but I'd prefer stuff past one liners**. I hit about 2-3 paragraphs if that works for you.\n\n\\- I\u2019m used to **DMing/GMing** but totally don\u2019t mind sharing. I\u2019d love to build up the world and characters with you! My DMs are open.\n\n\\- **If you don't see a genre you like here...** You can always contact me and we can work something out. I'm just very sick of European-based fantasy at the moment and will not write it Anything else? Feel free to contact me.\n\nI have a website where my preferences and fandoms/canon characters can be read in full: [***right here!***](https://moonsideswing.wixsite.com/roleplay) \u2605 If you managed to get through all that, let me know what your favorite song is right now.

            "selftext": "Hello!  Literate writer here seeking those of simillar skill to develop a story  I've been hoping to develop for some time now. Superman (you) x OC.  Discord is fine (just PM me), Facebook is also fine (with a separate  profile for it).  And if all bellow is too complicated, just say hi anyway, we'll figure it out.  \n\n\nYou're  welcome to alter the personality of the canon Superman (and turn it  sort of semi Injustice, a touch darker), and we can figure it out  together. I've a full bio for my OC also, though the following will  clear things up further.  \n\n\nThis  is a story from three temporal points, and I find this to be an added  layer of complexity. We begin in part 3 and retrospectively write about  part 1 and 2 through various scenes as we deem fit. Do remember this is  only a skeleton -- It's subject to changes as we deem it fit.  \n\n\nPart  1: Clark is a farmer boy, as in his canon story. OC is the daughter of a  wealthy-ish business man, very family oriented and very much a good  guy. They all live in Smallville temporarily. His business grows, he's  friends with Clark's dad. OC and Clark have some age difference - maybe  5-7 years. They know each other as children, as they go to the same  school. They're friends and have childhood memories.  \n\n\nPart  2: OC and her family are moved away to a bigger city as her dad's  business grows. Clark becomes interested in journalism and her dad  manages to find him a job (they're family friends by now). He's around  22 and she 15-17. Clark stays in the city for a little while doing this  internship or whatever it is. They get close with OC. She has another  boyfriend, and this is the time he meets Lois. They interact a fair bit,  share a fair few romantic moments (maybe her bf is being a jerk). They  end up sleeping together. He leaves, whether for Lois or to go home,  we'll figure it out.  \n\n\nPart  3: Lex Luthor (we don't know it's him yet) attempts to purchase OC's  father's company. OC's dad refuses. Luthor arranges an accident of his  entire family so that the company would become government property and  be sold to the highest bidder so he could buy it. OC survives, and is  put in an entire mess of family loss and having to struggle through  maintaining the business. She really loses herself in it. Business  flourishes, but she changes, grows quite reckless and both strong and  fragile at the same time. At a promotion for a new product, she again  meets Clark after many years who's there to write about the product.  They meet, Lois and her ex are out of the picture, and have many things  to mend together.  \n\n\nYou're welcome to come with questions. I tend to be friendly and polite. :)",

            "selftext": "***About me...***\n\n* I'm 21 years old female, GMT +3 timezone, English is not my first or mother-tongue language.\n* My preferred writing style is the third person. I ***LOVE*** to write from multi-paragraph to novella. However, I feel like quality is more important over qaquantity. \n* I am currently taking a break from my work, so I'm available a lot. But when I am busy, I do have tendency disappear from a few days to a week. I am also very laidback myself and I would never try to rush you to reply to me.\n* No kik. I prefer Discord for roleplaying since it's the most comfortable platform for me. But I'm also open to e-mail as well. \n* Please, don't send me messages to join a group rpg. Let's save everyone's time. I do appreciate your suggestion, but I don't have the time to join none of them at the moment. \n\n***What I expect/want from my roleplaying partner:***\n\n* I have nothing against underage writers. But the only reason I don't find comfortable writing with you if you are under 18, just in case if our roleplays were to turn a more mature way.\n* I like from slow to mild burn romances. I don't like when a plot ends up revolving around the *sexual themes*, this will take all of my interest away and I will drop out of a roleplay. \n* I love fluff and I love angst, and I love it when they mingle together with each other.\n* I want for you to have fun and let me know about your ideas/share your thoughts with me on a roleplay we're having. I want for you to feel included just as much since we're developing our characters and their world together. \n* I'm also open to multi-characters/multii-shipping, if that's what you're looking for too. Do you have an OC you were looking forward to roleplay against someone for a long time? Bring them to me! Or if we bound find out that we ship/enjoy the same couple - we can also always write them on the side!\n* For multi-shiping, I'm open to m/f, m/m and f/f, as well as shipping with non-binary characters.\n\n**Fandoms/Pairings/Ideas:**\n\n* My main fandoms are Marvel, DC and Miraculous Ladybug, and maybe a little bit of Kpop. While I'm familiar with a lot more I just have no interest in writing them at the moment. \n* Idea-although-not-so-much: I have a female OC character. She is a witch-mutant. She is a ne wsuperheroine and she works for the S.H.IE.L.D who I am bursting with an excitement to play. I have a bullet poitns (and full-on biography) written for her if anyone is interested to read. Be prepared for some darker themes. \n* Who I would write my character against? Steve Rogers (Captain America), Bruce Banner (Hulk), Tony Stark (Iron Man), Peter Parker (Spiderman), you can make suggestions to me too. But these four are the ones that would click with her  the most, in my head. \n* If we ever wanted for this to become an actuall full-on world, I'm open to playing a lot more characters, just not my OC. I also can play canon characters too, including both male and female. I am willing to give a try to anyone.  But we will have to discuss it amongst ourselves. We can make a full on superhero team with their own adventures and even include character deaths or weddings - whatever we decide to do!\n* My preferred timeline is: Pre-Infinity War/Infinity War/Endgame (depending on what do we decide). \n\nThank you for taking your time to read through my post! If you're itnerested - please don't hesitate and strike me a message! My arms are spread and waiting to hear from you! \n\nI wish you all the best in your search and hope you have fun writing!",

            "selftext": "I am looking to totally re-write the story of Game of Thrones between late season seven and the finale, as well as beyond that if it calls for it. Call it a way of personal mourning for what I consider a disservice to a great many characters that I care about deeply. Perspectively, I am looking for someone to be able to play Daenerys and a couple of other key plot characters and I would be taking the roles of a fair amount of plot characters to steer through the events as they unfold. It would begin before the fall of Viserion and go from there.  \n\n\nAlternatively, I am looking for an OC strict medieval fantasy involving rural areas and some supernatural elements. As for my writing style, I prefer to keep NSFW minimal as can be but do not shy away from more serious topics or character intimacy. I write best from a male perspective, but can write secondary female characters somewhat well when it calls for it. As the title suggests, I use only Discord and am looking for a partner interested in posting using that medium. Hope to hear from you soon! :)",

An established baseball player on the island, he goes on to become not only the best high school baseball player in the USA, but drafted high in the MLB draft and develops into a top generational talent.\n\nHere\u2019s where the roleplay comes in. My ultimate fantasy is play this man with someone who is a famous woman in movies, television, music, or modeling. Essentially- we would become America\u2019s \u201cit couple\u201d who battle tremendous paparazzi attention, the struggles of our career, met with raw emotion and intimacy.\n\nAs I am sure you can tell, I\u2019m a very detailed writer with a long term projection for this idea. I am flexible with all pieces involved though, and willing to make adjustments accordingly.\n\nMy top choices for your roles would be Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande, Hailee Steinfeld, Selena Gomez. Sommer Ray, Olivia Culpo, Tinashe, Kendall Jenner, Sophie Turner, and Alexis Ren. If you\u2019d rather be someone else or an original character like me I am flexible. \n\nAlso, I don\u2019t mind if you are male, female or otherwise as long as you want to play female, I don\u2019t judge at all.\n\nI hope to hear from all of you soon!",

Two major factions, and 3 minor factions, or you can choose not to join a faction and be independent.\n\nOur server features a detailed catalog of lore for the setting and a work-in-progress timeline from present day to 2175 to help players looking for world details they can employ to fully immerse their character creations into a setting populated by all walks of other players. We even have a map, featuring the general locations of all the places featured in RP channels.\n\nWe pride ourselves on our luck to have a relaxed, friendly community of players who are always more than happy to help a new member or write a new scene (no worries about being out of the loop!) New members are expected to treat others with the same respect, and are encouraged to contact a mod on the side if they have an issue with another player (so far we\u2019ve been very drama-free!)\n\nWhile this server does not have an age limit, we do warn new members that due to the tense nature of many story lines content may be regarded as 18+. NSFW content is to be left to private messages between the players involved, but violence, gore, strong language, and drugs are allowed in general server channels.\n\nJoin us for some roleplay fun, all experience levels are welcome!\n\n[https://discord.gg/BWPUR2G](https://discord.gg/BWPUR2G)",

            "selftext": "Hello folks!\n\nI'm trying to broaden my sphere of Roleplay scenarios, so here we go again ;)\n\n**What  am I looking for?**\n\nI'm    looking for a person with decent English skills  and ideally you    shouldn't be too lazy to type \"you\" instead of just \"u\".  I prefer it    when people are creative and don't ask me for the plot  beforehand and    instead develop the roleplay in the very moment of its  writing.    Time-wise you should be available every other day (naturally,  the more    frequent the better) though it's less a strict requirement than  a  wish   to keep the flow going.\n\n**What can  I offer?**\n\nI have about 10 years of experience with all kinds of  roleplays, in terms of language I can offer English and German.\n\n**What settings do I RP in?**\n\nHere's a few suggestion, though I'm open minded.\n\n1. A historical medieval setting in which I am a mercenary\n2. A realistic post-modern setting in which I am a police officer, optionally special forces.\n3. Any original characters in the setting of Bioshock Infinite's Columbia\n4. A modern or post-modern war setting, me being a soldier (optionally POW).\n5. Any alternative idea you have, as long as it is not based on anime heh ;)\n\n**How would I want the RP-Style to be?**\n\nPersonally     I prefer to type emotes without any special markings and spoken text    in direct quotes, spoken texts of \"NPCs\" in single-apostrophe. I dont    mind  if you prefer a different style, as long as it's  distinguishable.\n\nIn    terms of paragraph  length I prefer rather short but descriptive   sentences. When entering  a new setting (a new room for example), longer    paragraphs may be  appropriate but bloated 200-Words essays disrupt the    flow in my  opinion.\n\nNSFW content is principially possible, for as long as it is congruent with the rest of the roleplay and appropriate.\n\nI'm looking forward to your DMs,\n\nElena",

            "selftext": "Hi all!\n\nI'm looking for a 1x1 RP, primarily adventure/romance based, either set in a world we brainstorm together or in one of the settings below.  I'm hesitant to get too in depth with grand plans for my/our characters; I'm a big believer in working together at every step of the process.  Collaborative storytelling and all.  My ideal timeline here would be something along the lines of: PM to suss each other out &gt; Discord &gt; Large-Stroke Worldbuilding &gt; Character Building &gt; Finer Worldbuilding.  I guess it's just a lotta text to say that I want this to be a team effort from the get go.\n\nAs far as settings go, let's start from the top:\n\nPast is a fairly open topic.  Really, we could go just about anywhere with it.  Ancient civilization jumps out at me, as does the classic medieval Europe era.  We could also easily spice things up by tossing some fantasy in there, be it full blown elves and kobolds or just Europe/Greece/Aztecs/whatever + magic.  \n\nMy concept for a near-present world is much more fleshed out.  I used to write quite a bit on anonkun, and I'd like to visit a setting that I built up over there.  The OOC jist of it all is that it's Earth about 150 or so years in the future, post massive war, climate change, and general collapse.  This would be focused on the Great Lakes area of the US, which is now a massive stretch of interconnected salt flats.  Landships, ala FAR: Lone Sails, are the primary means of trade and transport.  It's essentially a steampunk-ish setting, when you get down to the core of it.\n\nFinal concept of mine is science-fiction.  Again, from a setting I've developed previously.  Essentially, humans are an uncontacted race.  We are humans which have just been abducted, or are about to be at least.  Things escalate from there.  I've written nearly 200 thousand words in this setting, and run a couple of TTRPGs in it - not to say it's a standout favorite, just that it's the one I could most easily give a 'canon' answer to a situation. That might get a bit in the way of the whole 2-way street worldbuilding I'm primarily looking for, though, so I'd like you to have a fair few thoughts of your own if you decide to go with this one.  There's a dash of space-magic here too, though if that's a turn-off we can obviously work things out.\n\nThere's my prompts, at least.  Like I said, I see these as jumping off points more than anything else.  I hope we get a back-and-forth going to tailor any setting we choose or develop to suit us better.\n\nI put the NSFW tag on here.  We can go as far into that, or as far from that, as you'd like.  I'm not opposed to either.  This being an adventure type RP, though, I do see a potential for violence.  And obviously, I'd like there to be some sort of connection/bond/attraction between the characters - whether it's acted on in depth, or not at all.\n\nIn terms of writing style, I use far too many commas and and comfortable in either first or third person.  I'll match you there; otherwise things get weird to read.  I tend to write 1-3ish paragraphs, trending shorter when we have a good back and forth going and longer if the posts are more spread out.  No matter the perspective, I like to include some of my character's thoughts in my writing.  I think this gives it more of a novel feel, and also gives you a very meta source of information about my character, so that things can flow a bit better.  I'm also very into having OOC discussions about what we'd like to see happen, goals, etc.  Again, it keeps things flowing.\n\nAnyway, there's the spiel!  If you feel like we could get something going, toss me a PM.",

Would anyone be interested in playing a male OC character against a female OC character based around the Marvel/DC comics verse?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I'm looking for something shippy. I don't want for our characters to know about each other's superhero identities. So perhaps they both tend to get into funny situations- where they see each other after detransforming back or a situation itself requires a superhero duty. Maybe, our characters are in love with each other and with each other's superheroes identities too, so they're sort of caught up in this love quadruple.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have a female OC character who is scientist. Her backstory can include a few TWs such as mental hospital. I can send you a backstory of hers once you message me to discuss the idea with me, if you want to find out more about her. You are also more than welcomed to headcanon and brainstorm the ideas for your own character too.   Just that I'm looking for a character.. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just thought that it'd be more fun to play with someone who's a bit like Johnny Storm character wise. Flirtatious and feisty, maybe he can be a doctor or scientist like her. They both meet each other for the first time when they're fighting someone as superheroes. But the actual time they both meet each other is through his brother and my character's friend. Your character's brother is a hacker/technology person for her superhero team, so like I said, imagine all the fun situations it could get them to and his brother knowing the truth entire time about both of them. (;  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm mostly looking for plot/world building, I'm fine with writing smut, if that's what you are looking for. Just make sure that there's at least a little bit of build up for that. I'm a multi-para to novella writer. I care about quality over quantity much more, so don't worry about having to match my length!   I'm also very welcoming for your ideas if you may have some of yours! Don't be afraid to share them with me. &lt;3   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo yes, please, hit me up if you would like to write together!",

By some blessing or curse he awoke, still in his all black clothing. He checked- his guns were holstered at his belt, his two grand revolvers still there. He checked that his wide brimmed hat was still there- he still had all of his clothing on. How was he not dead? The man did not notice that he now lacked flesh or most of his organs.

Above is the prompt to get a roleplay going, in cooperation with anyone who would be interested. Firstly, I am looking for a generally active partner to roleplay with. I understand life happens, but I'd like consistency in setting up a schedule to roleplay. Along with this an understanding between both of us that sometimes, stuff comes up!\n\nHow would the roleplay turn out with the man who suddenly transported to a Fantasy world, guns on his hips, a skeleton now? That's for us to decide based on your character. It could be nearly anything you could think of. Just some random guy or gal who has a man suddenly appear in their home, a prince or princess who wakes up to find a skeleton standing and scanning their room. Even a person who was also transported in death, a former enemy of the man, even. If you are interested please message me!",

            "selftext": "Across the entirety of universe 7173, a chilling message spread like a plague across any and every form of communication. The opening alone was enough to unnerve anyone except for the most powerful beings in the universe, and even then...\n\n*To anyone who can hear this, the Cosmic Defenders have fallen. The Rider has become too powerful. Any attempts at defeating her have been met with death and destruction. She is currently rending what remains of humanity from what remains of planet Terra-871. If you've received this message, evacuate immediately.*\n\n*Meanwhile on Terra-871...*\n\nThe Cosmic Defenders, the most renowned heroes in the universe, struggle to stay on their in the face of a skeletal figure covered in white flames. Toni Stark, known as Ironwill, stands defiant in her most powerful suit, the Nautilus-57. For all of its modifications acquired from her universal travel, this suit has nearly every imaginable weapon at the ready, symbiotic with the most powerful AI she could possibly acquire. Her, the Guardian of Lightning, Paragon and the last of which whose name escapes her at the moment, have accepted their fates. \n\nWith her in the front of their group, Paragon limps to her side and raises his sword and shield, as does the Guardian his mighty spear and their fourth her rifle. The Rider begins walking toward them when Paragon turns to his suited comrade. \"Did you ever finish that last project?\"\n\n\"Almost, I never perfected it.\"\n\nA short pause. \"Toni--\"\n\n\"No, this is my fight too.\" \n\nHe takes a stance in front of her that the other two mimic. \"Go, get help. Don't let all this be for nothing.\"\n\n\"I won't leave, I need to--\"\n\nThe guardian, a much larger man than Paragon looks back over his shoulder. \"My friend, you are indeed a mighty warrior, and I will sing your songs at the table until I can sing no more. I beg of you in our last few moments, go. We will think no less of you.\"\n\nThe woman in the suit feels the tears fall out of her eyes and mix with the dried blood on her face. \"I'll be back, I promise.\"\n\nWith a short flight away, she can only listen to the sounds of the battle raging on nearby while she works on a machine on her inner wrist. Her AI lists off the countless risks, but is promptly ignored. When everything is finished, she stands in front of a portal leading seemingly into nothing. She looks back just in time to see Paragon lifted up by his throat and run through with his own sword before being thrown to the side. With only their fourth between her and the Rider, she forces herself through the portal against her own will. \n\nBut her suit was not prepared for the jump. \n\nShe quickly runs out of oxygen and loses consciousness, running dangerously close to death before finally the portal brings her to other side and into what appears to be her world, before she initiated the Scorched Earth protocol. She begins to fall helplessly while her suit attempts many protocols at protecting her. \"Attempting revitalization...attempt failed. Attempting electro shock revitalization...attempt failed.\" The list goes on shortly, with her plummet reaching terminal velocity. By now she is assumed to be Iron Man and attempts at contact are made but fall flat. She draws ever closer to the ground before finally...\n\n\"Engaging Phoenix protocol.\" The suit springs to life on its own and coats its owner in a gel to absorb the shock of the landing, and cuts off any attempts to reduce the falling speed. The figure crashes through several buildings at incredible speed, bounces several times off the road, and comes to a stop eventually in the middle of Times Square. \n\n*So I've had this idea for a little while, but now I'm posting it finally. Ideally, I'd like to play this against an Iron Man or Ironheart, but I'll take most anyone at this point. The idea for her suit is based on the Endgame suits, but a bit more. I do have a few things I'm picky about, but just message me with who you want to be and we'll go from there. Female characters get priority.*",

As the title suggests i'm looking mainly for an MxM sort of thing. I'm not opposed to other pairings so if you have something in mind you can always pitch it to me! Before we get to much further though here are some rules i'd like followed!:\n\n\\- Be 18+ please! I'm 25 and it makes me much more comfortable to roleplay with people over the legal age limit!\n\n\\- Be able to write at least a paragraph per reply. Sometimes less is okay in places of dialogue but generally I like some substance to the posts.\n\n\\- Let me know if you're going to be gone more then a couple of days. Life happens, I work a full time job and have a life so I get it. Just don't leave me hanging!\n\nThat's about it! I'm pretty simple and chill, I don't really get uppity about a lot of things. =) On to the genres!\n\nI do so many types of roleplays! Medieval, modern, scifi, slice of life, fantasy. I generally like fantasy added to my roleplays in some shape or form but we don't have to if that doesn't float your boat. Right now i'm really craving some good modern fantasy, but I won't say no to other ideas!\n\nWith that said just shoot me a message on here and we can chat. I like to use discord to roleplay over, so preferably we would eventually move to that platform. Also, please send me a bit of substance in your dm to me on here. Don't just ask if i'm still looking, tell me a bit about yourself and what you're looking for. Thanks! Hope to hear from a couple of you!",

I roleplay solely on Minecraft. I need a visual aid to help me immerse myself, and that\u2019s exactly why Minecraft does. There are a handful of medieval fantasy-themed RPG servers that we can choose from. For each server there\u2019s a whitelist form that you apply for, it grants you access. \n\nOnce accepted we can figure out why sort of duo we want. A mother and her child, a beloved couple, a mage and their young apprentice. There\u2019s a whole lot of lore for us to reference to when making these decisions. \n\nI look forward to meeting you.

            "selftext": "Hello. I\u2019m a 31 year old female in Texas looking for a longterm roleplay.\n\nThe idea I have is that your character is a journalist. Wanting and longing for so much more but having a somewhat comfortable and steady job writing fluff pieces for a magazine. Being one of the only, if not the only male in your department, you\u2019re tasked with writing a piece on dating in the modern era from a males perspective. After arguing with your boss about wanting to do something more substantial, she challenges you. If you can write about dating, and then about love, true falling in love as a man and how it happens, she\u2019ll give you the liberty to write any piece you want. You have a month for your dating piece, and your due date for the move piece is 3 months. \n\nKnowing you have to get the ball on the road, you agree reluctantly and take off from the office to a bar to find a subject for your piece. That\u2019s where my character comes up. She\u2019s a closed off, difficult person so you have to get creative on how to approach her. Sure, she\u2019s alone at the bar on a Friday night but that doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s interested. Dressed in professional attire, a pencil skirt and silk blouse with 5 inch heels, she\u2019s almost intimidating. \n\nWill your character be able to approach her? Get a date? Make her fall in love? Will you have to constantly remind yourself that this is all for a piece and freedom to write about what matters to you, or will it become more real than you had thought it would?\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in the plot, please send me a message with your age and time zone. Put -Mango- in the message or subject so I know you read this. I prefer literate, 3rd person writing. \n\nThank you if you\u2019ve read this far! :)",

I used to RP quite a bit, but fell off the wagon a while ago. Though I\u2019ve recently noticed that I\u2019ve hit a really hard art block, and haven\u2019t picked up a pen/pencil/tablet pen, in almost over a year. I recently purchased a tablet for myself, in hopes that a new piece of equipment would spark my want to draw again, but quickly realized that I\u2019m missing the motivation and the drive to draw. I need people to help with ideas, and also benefit from it. I usually stick to genres like \u2018 adventure, action, romance, slice of life, and other genres that closely mirror these or go hand and hand with them. The last time I RP\u2019ed it was DnD based, and I created a story from the RP with my best friend, but they\u2019ve become busy with work and school.\nI\u2019m typically pretty free, though I do have a full time job, and a life outside of my job as well. I will be sure to let you know if I can\u2019t post a response in a timely manner for that day, but I normally have Thursday\u2019s and Fridays off from work. \nI like to post a few paragraphs, and get invested with characters, story lines, and also the person that I\u2019m RPing with as well, because we\u2019re both human (hopefully... if you\u2019re a lizard in a human skin, that\u2019s really awesome too) and both require some sort of friendship or interaction with another person time to time. \nI plan on using Discord for the interaction for RP / chatting, though if you prefer google documents, or another form of IM service, just let me know. (I\u2019m newer to Reddit, and I\u2019m not too sure how messaging works, but I\u2019m sure that I\u2019ll figure something out.)\nIf you want to message me right away on Discord, please feel free too : Soi#4576\nIf you choose to use a different service, just message me on here.\nI typically RP as a female, and can create new characters pretty easily if I don\u2019t have a current character that suits your taste, or anything else we would be working on together, etc.\n\nI hope interest a few people.",

I'm interested in medieval fantasy, mythology, adventure, romance, drama, and all that good stuff. I'm fairly easy, though, so I'd also be down for a modern story. Feel free to let me know what you like, too! I have some plot and pairing ideas, but I'd prefer elaborating on the exact plot of the story together.\n\nAbout my style; I write in third person, past tense, paragraph style. Reply length varies, but I'd say generally it's 2-5 paragraphs. I only roleplay over email! Usually, I'll have time to reply at least once a day, and I'll let you know if I'll be gone for more than a couple of days.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you!",

The Demigod's Sanctuary is a new group roleplay, one that \\*is not based on the Percy Jackson lore\\*, but instead literal Greek mythology. Because of this, all the gory, ridiculous, and downright awful things that have been recorded throughout history within Greek mythology may appear, so who knows what will happen next!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you're interested or would like more information, please send me off a message!  \n\n\nWe're looking forward to hearing your ideas soon!",

            "selftext": "Hello, dear writer, and welcome to this mess of a post that is an attempt at grouping some ideas I've been wanting to play around!\n\nFirst, a bit about myself, just to give a warm welcome. I'm from Canada, EST, and I've been out of touch with my writer self in the past months. Lots and lots have happened, but here I am, ready to dive in wonderful plots once more! A very magical partner of mine has been very patient with me during these months, and if she stumbles across this post, I want this Sorcerer to know I'm always thankful for her patience ~\n\nNow, for the actual fun stuff. I've been craving some ideas, some character archetypes, some scenarios. I'll try to cover as much as I can, but by all means, feel free to tell me about your desires, and we'll build something we can both enjoy exploring! \n\nFirst part; a very well grated school campus. \nHeh, see what I did there? What I mean is, I haven't written a cheesy romance in forever. However, there's a twist; it's most likely not the super-cliche'd pairing you'd expect! Here are some possibilities to make this happen;\n\n- The Athlete; she's the cherry on top of her club. Her teammates admire her, she's the coach's favorite, and perhaps the boys have tried to approach her more than people would think. She's a bit of a tomboy with a booming energy, but that's exactly what MC fell for. This unstoppable force of nature easily broke through the thin walls of his heart, and from there, things escalate, at a pace that can be as slow as the passing of the seasons, or as rushed as the adrenaline in a dangerous situation.\n\n- The President; She's calm, serious, hardworking. Of course, she has a stable social circle and stands tall, but it's hard to guess her feelings, as she rarely exposes even the slightest hint of her true nature. She could be cold, or she could hide it all behind a radiant smile. Such a mystery was bound to get MC's interest, a new member of the student council. He'll be poking in all sorts of angles in hopes to find a weakness in her fortress. She's not a machine, so there has to be something in there!\n\n- The Punk; She terrorizes the campus. Her reputation might seem exaggerated, but she's the real deal. No one makes eye contact with that lionness. How many guys is she seeing? How many losers has she broken? And the real question, how does she end up with MC? Is he her favorite victim, her precious target? Or perhaps did they get paired up in a project? Let's discuss to find a bridge that is best suited to our desires.\n\n- The Tease/Bully; Oh, how she loves to tease MC. Perhaps she's been his friend forever, perhaps she happens to be a new classmate, or even worse, roommate. But is she just all talk? Something is about to explode somewhere. (This kind of tension can be mixed in with any other archetype easily!)\n\nThe second part is going to be super short, but open to discussions. This other idea is a distopy that takes place in a post-modern city, where all sorts of technologies have become available, and it caused a chaos. The government tried to slow down the development of possibly dangerous technologies and chemical creations, but all it did was push them down to the black market. Years later, the city in which we write is corrupted to the core, where very little of what people think is law is enforced. It's become a harsh world of survival, where most people still work 9-to-5 jobs, but try to stay locked in the safety of their home or office. In there, there is one boy, naive and confident, that hopes to eliminate as much of this mold as possible. He dreams of a future where his home's hands are clean of fraudulent scums, mafias and ill-intended corporations. His first step? Sabotage as many industries as possible. And there, we would begin our plot!\n\nAs you've maybe noticed, I have a preference for... well, strong female leads. The strength, the pride, the confidence in a woman's heart... it melts me, and it inspires me to write a vibrant story. I guess that parenthesis was necessary, in hopes that it helps you understand me better.\n\nSo long as this post is up, my DMs are open! Feel free to skate your way in, and either share your thoughts about the plots you've read or the ones that have been anchored deep in your mind for so long. I can't wait to meet you!\n\nP.S.: If you've read to the end, please include your favorite color in the title, thanks! &lt;3 I won't be mean if you forget, but I might poke about it, to be sure o:",

I\u2019m hoping to find a long-term role-play partner, that will, in their free time, indulge in descriptive, literate storytelling surrounding an interesting, male/female love story that we can come up with together. I wish to have a partner that can spell correctly, use correct grammar (not that I\u2019m perfect all the time), as well as punctuation, capitalization, and be admirably descriptive in their writing. I don\u2019t exactly desire extreme novels to be sent back, and forth, just messages containing enough effort of description so we, each-other, can really understand, see, hear, and feel what\u2019s going on for our characters in the role-play. I\u2019m also looking for somebody who prefers a build-up to NSFW. If there\u2019s no build-up, it has to at least contribute, and make sense with the story, which I wouldn\u2019t mind at all!\n\nI do have a list of role ideas, if you\u2019d like to have a look at it, as I would be willing to hear any of your ideas, as well! I\u2019m open-minded, and I hope you\u2019ll be, too. I seek honesty, and communication between me and my role-play partner, yet as for general communication and conversation apart from the rp, I\u2019m not MUCH of a talker. Of course, I won\u2019t ignore you OOC, I just have my intentions set more on the role-play, and getting to know your writing skills, rather. \ud83d\ude0a Hope that\u2019s okay! \n\nI do Discord only! If you\u2019re interested, please send a message my way, and please include your Discord username. Hope to hear from you. \ud83e\udd29",

            "selftext": "  \n\n***About me...***\n\n* Hello! I'm 21 years old female, GMT +3 timezone, English is not my first or mother-tongue language.\n* My preferred writing style is the third person. I ***LOVE*** to write from multi-paragraph to novella. However, I also feel like quality is more important over quantity, so I don\u2019t ask you to match my length. \n* I am currently taking a break from my work, so I'm available a lot. But when I am busy, I do have tendency disappear from a few days to a week. I am also very laidback myself and I would never try to rush you to reply to me. I try to reply once a day.\n* No kik. I prefer Discord for roleplaying since it's the most comfortable platform for me. But I'm also open to e-mail as well!\n* I promise I\u2019m very approachable and easy to talk to out-of-character. I love making friends outside of roleplaying world! :D\n\n***What I expect/want from my roleplaying partner:***\n\n* I have nothing against underage writers but I don't find comfortable writing with them.\n* I like from slow to mild burn romances. I don't like when a plot ends up revolving around the *sexual theme* too much and starts to feel like it\u2019s about to overtake an entire plot - my interest may begin slipping away. \n* I love fluff and I love angst, and I love it when they mingle together with each other.\n* I want for you to have fun and let me know about your ideas/share your thoughts with me on a roleplay we're having. I want for you to feel included just as much, since we're  both developing our characters and their world together.\n* I'm also open to multi-characters/multi-shipping, if that's what you're looking for too. Do you have an OC you were looking forward to roleplay against someone for a long time? Bring them to me! Or if we both find out that we ship/enjoy the same couple - we can also always write them on the side. \n* For multi-shipping, I'm open to m/f, m/m and f/f, as well as shipping with non-binary characters. I can roleplay female, male, non-binary characters too! \n\n**Fandoms/Pairings/Ideas:**\n\n* My main fandoms are Marvel, DC and Miraculous Ladybug, and maybe a little bit of Kpop. While I'm familiar with a lot more I just have no interest in writing them at the moment.\n* *A bit about my character:* I have a female OC character. She is a witch-mutant. She is a new superheroine and she works for the S.H.IE.L.D who I am bursting with an excitement to play. I have a bullet points (and full-on biography) written for her if anyone is interested to read. Be prepared for some darker themes.\n* Who I would write my character against? Steve Rogers (Captain America), Bruce Banner (Hulk), Tony Stark (Iron Man), Peter Parker (Spiderman), you can make suggestions to me too. But these four are the ones that would click with her the most, in my opinion.\n* If we ever wanted for this to become an actual full-on world, I'm open to playing a lot more characters, just not my OC. I also can play canon characters too, including both male and female. I am willing to give a try to anyone \n* For multi-muse roleplaying world, we can make a full superhero team with their own adventures or even make up our own villains. Births, deaths, weddings, divorces! If we both get bored of a character or just want to end their storyline, we can always drop them off of the earth and pick them up again sometime in the future too. Even include NPCs, like family members or exes \u2013 and we can expend on them a bit more. \n* My preferred timeline is: Pre-Infinity War/Infinity War/Endgame (depending on what do we decide write after all!).\n\nThank you for taking your time to read through my post! If you're interested - please don't hesitate and strike me a message! My arms are spread and waiting to hear from you!\n\nI wish you all the best in your search and hope you have fun writing!",

            "selftext": "Hi folks,\n\nI'm a woman in the **PST time zone** looking for a **romance** RP partner. I'd like semi-frequent responses at scheduled times (based on availability) &amp; a partner with a writing style similar to mine (sample included below). I enjoy world-building, romance RPs with jealousy, and having side characters.\n\n**This is not a smut setting.** While NSFW materials may be involved it is NOT primarily about the sex. Please respect that I like medium to slow burn romances. A **Fantasy** romance/slice of life RP is what I'm looking for, especially a combination of the two settings.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**First a few things about me:**\n\n* 23\n* 3rd Person, past tense writer\n* Variable response length (1 paragraph or more)\n* Primarily writes women but open\n\n**I'm looking for:**\n\n* Decent grammar &amp; spelling\n* Willing to play characters of any/all genders\n* Can play multiple characters\n* **Over 21 years old**\n\nMy desires are pretty simple: I'd like to RP a romance centered slice of life in a fantasy setting. From meeting to the established relationship &amp; farther than that if the characters take us there. I'm not a huge fan of humans/elves/standard races if there are other, setting acceptable, races. I live for world building &amp; desire a partner to build the world with me. This requires active responses, a willingness to let go of some control, and cooperation!\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Plot Ideas:**\n\nI want to roleplay the meeting, courting, and eventual marriage of a \"barbarian\" (**gruff &amp; buff male character**) &amp; his counterpart. I'm open to a variety of settings but prefer fantasy and post-apocalyptic settings the most.\n\n**Ideally,** the barbarian is part of a **nomadic tribe** &amp; the future bride is not, either a noble arranged marriage, farmers daughter, or tragic things happen &amp; she crosses his path. I would love to build a tribal, nomadic culture together or independently in order to make this happen. If it's a post-apocalyptic scene, the backstories will likely be much darker.\n\n**Settings:** Co-created worlds, homebrew or not, D&amp;D, Skyrim, Shadowrun, &amp; More. **NO FANDOM RPS**. All characters must be original.\n\nI would prefer my partner being willing to play at least one \"alpha\" male character, someone big and strong that's kind of gruff (dark past optional). I enjoy writing sarcastic, pessimistic characters the most but do occasionally write bubbly or chronically sad characters.\n\nDM me your ideas &amp; we can get to work building a great RP!\n\n**More About Me:**\n\nI enjoy stupid **tropes**, soulmates, love triangles, strange or unique races (Dragonborn, Hobgoblins, Tieflings, basically non-standard fantasy races), polar opposite attraction, jealousy, angst, and drama in my RPs.\n\n**When you DM me include a writing sample/character concept**. I will NOT respond if one isn't included one or the other. Character concepts that aren't fully human will be given top priority.\n\nMy **Writing Samples:**\n\n1 (long sample)\n\nClear ocean waves broke against dark black sand beaches as the ship swayed its way into a crowded dock, filled with beings of all ages and races. The town in which the docks were located appeared to be old, positively ancient by some standards, made of wood and stone, textured by the salt and water of the sea. The dock itself is in better repair and as the ship is tied to it there isn't any ominous creak or sway. Slightly further inland a tall, lanky, copper-skinned tiefling stands beside a gnome less than half her size, seemingly waiting for something. Upon sighting the ship dock, the tiefling raised a hand towards it, pointed, and said words which could not be heard over the crashing of waves. Overall, the tiefling seems fairly disinterested in the events but if one were closer they would have seen the gleam in her eye. The gnome nodded her head at her friend and a wide grin surfaced. Even from many yards away, her excitement could be felt. And so the women waited, eyes evaluating each person who stepped off the ship, waiting for the adventurer they'd hired to aid them.\n\n\"Do you think that's him?\" The gnome bubbled over with enthusiasm, eyes light with excitement. \"We agreed to meet him at Old Man's Grotto, Sham.\" The tiefling, Xyn, rolled her eyes in exasperation. \"Well, that doesn't mean that *isn't* him.\" Sham pouted a bit, large blue eyes turning a little puppyish and Xyn glances back at the man the gnome had gestured to before shaking her head. \"He's headed in the opposite direction.\" \"Oh. Maybe we should head to the tavern, then?\" \"Yes.\" With that, the two headed off towards the south of the town, passing many old buildings until they reached a ramshackle building with a creaking sign hung overhead reading 'Old Man's Grotto - Inn &amp; Tavern'. Xyn opened the large oaken door, though why there even was a door when it had enough cracks the sea winds could enter easily and one could practically see through it, nobody knew, and they entered the establishment. Shamra wandered up the bar to order as Xyn grabbed a table in the corner, keen grey eyes scanning the crowds entering the Grotto, quite interested in whatever adventurer was being sent her way.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2 (short sample)\n\nShe closes the door behind her silently, her feet barely a whisper, entrance covered by the boisterous crowd already inside. After looking around she approaches the bar, leaning over it before ordering her meal. Once her order is taken, she pays with some coin and finds a seat in one of the less crowded portions of the tavern.\n\nIntelligent hazel eyes search the crowd for a familiar face before she sets her head in a hand, alone for today. Long, brown painted nails, the color just starting to chip, clack against the table as she people watches. The dim tavern light plays over delicate features as her eyes flit about, occasionally sitting and staring at whatever and whoever had caught her interest.\n\n**This is a SAMPLE, NOT THE START OF THE RP. Feel free to work off of either for your writing sample.**",

            "selftext": "__Hi everyone and thanks for taking the time to check out my post.__\n\n\nAs I have found it quite useful in constructing these in the past, I will be outlining the two main characters I have in mind for this idea first, then explain the setting and finally give you an idea what I am looking for.\n\n\nFair warning I wrote the female main character with Taylor Swift in mind, but before you click away and dismiss this as just another thirsty plot trying to live out some fantasy, I'd ask that you please read the rest first. My reason for mentioning her us that she for one is at the level of fame and fortune I envision for the character's career and (though embarrassing to admit) because I actually quite like her music and thus know about it.\n\n\n### Without a voice is a singer still a singer?\n\n\nHer career had been at its all time high. Her fans ranged from teenagers discovering her music now to the precious late 20s early 30s demographic, people her own age.\n\n\nEach album an instant chart topper, each single a hit on radio stations worldwide, each tour sold out within minutes of tickets going live. She had it all, money, fame, everything the young girl dreaming of a life in the big cities had dreamed of.\n\n\nAnd then, one morning she woke up with a cold. as usual her voice was all but gone, her throat sore, her nose runny. Nothing to worry about. Certainly not an affliction that a few days rest couldn't cure. And sure enough the cold went, her throat no longer scratchy, her nose clear. Yet her voice never returned.\n\n\nShe could speak just fine, sure. But anything any attempt to conjure a tune and an unbearably sharp pain would stab at her vocal chords. Understandably panic ensued. Innumerable doctors, of increasing specialisation and renown, later, she was left with the most infuriating of diagnoses. _\"Idiopathic\"_ The medical profession's fancy term for, \"we don't know what it is, what caused it or how to fix it\"\n\n\nPanic turned to depression. The machinery of show business kicked into gear and within a month, her label, who had been wooing her with contracts, trying to lock down her next album deal, had liquidated her. Her tours were cancelled, talk show invitations rescinded and soon enough she was well and truly out.\n\n\nNot that most would have considered her fate truly tragic of course. She had been the single most profitable artist prior to her fall. Her wealth was considerable, even in the hedonistic hills of Hollywood.\n\n\nYet, with it all gone, she no longer felt at home amongst those who still had _it_, whatever _it_ was. Her music had been her life, even with all the money and fame, she had always loved it best. No longer able to sing her songs, she couldn't have bared to pen them for someone else.\n\n\nThe decision to leave, to turn her back on her idyllic California estate and the penthouse in New York, took her little time. She had her chief of staff, in what would likely be her final act - for she couldn't see what she's need a staff for now - inquire about suitable accommodation in the one place she'd always imagined she might one day live. England, more specifically, the luscious southern countryside of the home counties.\n\n\nShe wasn't sure what exactly drew her to that small island across the ocean. She'd visited during her tours of course, but only the larger cities, London, Manchester, Birmingham and the like. Maybe it was the idyllic pictures she had seen or the TV series romanticising that part of the country, but something had always drawn her to the rolling hills of southern England.\n\n\nSoon enough a number of promising advertisements made their way to her, including a peculiar listing for a country villa, formally part of, but offered for rent separately from a much larger estate.\n\n\n### _Noblesse oblige_ whether one likes it or not\n\n\nFor most of his life, the heir to Edgerton estate had despised his father, its lord. Had anyone dared to ask why, he likely couldn't have named a single, determining moment that inspired the arctic climate between them. It wasn't so much the man himself he hated, but what he stood for, what he represented: An ancient breed of aristocrats, who, defying the changing times, still clung onto power and wealth in modern England.\n\n\nThe Edgerton estate was about as old and esteemed as one might find. The family inheriting its name had been its keepers for centuries. Through wars, civil and foreign, throughout the reigns of many a king and queen, the lords of Edgerton manor had help positions of great importance and power.\n\n\nThe fortune, amassed over the estate's long history - much of it through means looked less than fondly on today - the family enterprise, now no longer in shipping and manufacturing, but the financial markets, even the hereditary peerage granting Lord Edgerton a seat in the house of lords, all remained to this day.\n\n\nThe son of the man currently reigning over this empire could not have loathed more what he was to inherit one day. In his mind his family represented everything he felt was holding back his country from becoming what his generation wished it could be.\n\n\nDeep down he knew that beyond this, his disdain for his father was rooted in the man's indifference to his mother, the one creature on this earth he had felt closest to. Until illness took her from him and had him sent away, across the country to boarding school. When he emerged, years later, as a young man, from the wood panelled halls of Eton, he wished nothing more than to leave it all behind.\n\n\nDenouncing his father's wishes he pursued a degree in the sciences, something the Lord of Edgerton Manor had little use of, or so he was told. Four years at university did much to lighten his spirit. He had almost forgotten the weight on his shoulders, knowing that one day he would be called upon to take his father's place.\n\n\nHis passion for science, another great treasure university had bestowed upon him, lead him to a career in research. He was three years into his doctoral studies when his old life returned to haunt his soul.\n\n\nHis father, by no means of old age and of sound health, had passed away to the great dismay of both his household and the English nobility at large. Having always hoped he'd have time to prepare, maybe even find an escape, the son now found himself burdened overnight with his father's privileges and duties.\n\n\nAfter resisting for a month or so, he soon realised that he stood no chance, one man against centuries of tradition and the fate of many a person in the balance. For while the business was largely conducted with only marginal oversight of the lord, the estate of Edgerton Manor still had in its employ more than a hundred residents of the villages surrounding its expansive lands.\n\n\nWith a heavy heart the new Lord Edgerton had to abandon his studies and return \"home\". Settling into the Manor and getting a grasp of what would likely constitute the daily routine of his remaining years left him irritable and depressed.\n\n\nOne of the many unwelcome tasks he found himself settled with was to decide how to handle his mother's estate. The large, country house, situated on the edge of Edgerton Park, the local name for the gardens, lakes and woodland surrounding the main manor, had passed to him when he lost her. His only fond childhood memories were all set in its gardens, lovingly kept by his mother, who was also the heroine of each story.\n\n\nAfter deliberating for a week, he decided that he could not justify keeping the housekeeper and gardener charged with its upkeep employed if the house was to remain unoccupied. Thus he begrudgingly allowed the property to be listed for rent, under the strict stipulation that any prospective tenant would be carefully vetted by him personally.\n\n\nIn case someone has wondered, I have (loosely) based the female character on Taylor Swift (wait don't run for the hills just yet!) and the male on my own experiences going to a painfully posh boarding school and interacting with people (usually parents) from that world. Have you clicked away yet? No? Good! First of all don't worry, I only went to school with those people, I'm not exactly one of them (too poor). As for the obnoxious reference to a celebrity, please don't think that I'm simply looking to live out some sad fantasy featuring exactly her and no one else. I include Ms. Swift (albeit begrudgingly) only so that you might get a better idea of the kind of age, fame, etc. I have in mind for the character. Feel free to make her your own in every way! \u00a0\n\n\n### The setting (other than \"in England\")\n\n\nAs the tag indicates, I see this as a slow-burning, realistic romance. Both characters have had a rather bleak time getting to where we would be picking up the story, so there is plenty of development to be had.\n\n\nI'm also always looking to expand a story beyond the confines of just a single genre. I for example see these two characters helping each other cope with their respective situations. Their new environment and eventual relationship leaves things open for all sorts of storylines to be explored.\n\n\nI can see there being elements of mystery, intrigue, adventure and much more as the story develops. And it's worth noting that I consider \"long-term\" to truly mean __long-term__. I find that if the story grips my imagination (and I have a good writing partner to scheme with) I will keep having new ideas.\n\n\n### My \"style\" (or lack thereof)\n\n\nNow even though I appear to have written a short story about each character, I hope I haven't come across like a dictator. I do in fact highly value world and character building as a team sport. Any potential partner of mine should know that I want to them to feel like they can truly make their character their own.\n\n\nIn addition to this, I am always happy to discuss ideas and suggestions for additions or alterations to the plot and general universe of the story. After all roleplaying is supposed to be __collaborative__ storytelling!\n\n\nThat being said I do have a \"style\" that I stick to while writing, so if you are interested, I ask you at least consider agreeing to it as a rough frame. I write in third person, past tense, and usually in reasonable detail and length (who would've guessed huh...). Literacy is rather important to me, so if you enjoy a very fast paced, short reply style, we probably wouldn't match too well.\n\n\n### Wrapping things up (omg finally!)\n\n\nFirst of all, if you have made it all the way down here, congratulations and thank you! Give yourself a pat on the back! I do truly appreciate people taking the time to read through my ramblings.\n\n\nIf you are still around, I take it I have managed to at least slightly peak your interest. (Yay!) If you have questions, suggestions, comments or (constructive) criticism but aren't sure if this is the roleplay for you yet, please don't hesitate to contact me!\n\nIf on the other hand, you've come away from all of this with the firm belief that you and this story are made for each other... same goes, please send me a message and say hello!\n\n\nI look forward to your messages.\n\n\nx",

And though not needed, I find it more fun to play more than one character but that one is up to you.\n\nIf you're interested or have any questions, just message me and I will send you my discord stuff.",

            "selftext": "In the years following the civil war, the government of the United States would practically give away land in the new Texas territory. The land was abundant and there were many opportunities located in its hots deserts, windy grasslands, leaning mountains, and serene woodlands. Some people would come to the state with the intentions of starting business or creating new business opportunities due to the state's proximity to the border and plentiful mineral deposits; additionally, some people would come to stake their own land, away from civilization in the practically uninhabited state. There were also people who came to the State of Texas for the mere adventure that comes from new places, illegal or legal. Either way, the history of the state would begin in the New Frontier, which was located on the Eastern side of Texas. The city was a symbol for new beginnings, hence its name \"New Frontier\". In the beginning, Texas was a lawful state with many sheriffs passionate about upholding the law in the name of this new beautiful country and the regular folk worked in peace. It was a peaceful place until Clive Martin showed up. When Clive had made his way into the New Frontier, nobody knew of his criminal affiliations or the large gang he had amassed; however, he had a sinister grin and an ambitious gaze. He had made his arrival just as elections were beginning and people were picking their candidates for governor. Many people had already cast in their lot with the popular Kurt Ruth who had once been sheriff of Bayside and was known to conduct his duties well. He was beloved by many in Bayside and his reputation for being a good lawmen was popular in the state of Texas. James Russel, a popularly known corrupt politician who had an unproven drug habit, ran against Ruth for the seat of governor and unbeknownst to others, was endorsed by Clive Martin. Many people scoffed at Russel and did not expect him to even get close to winning the election; however, Martin would fix the election. When Russel became governor, many people were astonished and became filled with dread as well as fear. In New Freedom, many deputies were killed and the sheriff, Billy Bogden, another lawful man had to succumb to Martin once he had threatened his family. This was one of the many atrocities that Clive Martin and his gang would commit as they took over every place of importance in the state of Texas. Many people would come to fear Clive Martin, who took any life that got in his way. Now, it is seven years later and Martin still controls Texas; however, each year is wood on the fire known as vengeance.\n\n.............................\n\nHello, I am looking for people to join my group that is known as Western Vengeance. It is a Western Role play where writers have the opportunity to play whatever their heart desires in such a universe. While it is a role play group, it is different from most groups. I do not have a formal set of rules as I think I should not have to tell anybody how to act like a decent person. I made this group for the enjoyment of writing and I do not have time for people who do not know how to conduct themselves. Activity is not a big focus in this group as many of the writers will have responsibilities and other obligations; however, if I do not see a person active for at the most a month then I will remove the said person from the group. If one is involved in a plot and has not replied in three days, they will be skipped or if the reply is of importance, I will take over the character temporarily. This group is also different in the fact that no matter how many members are in the group, the story, even the bigger plots, will continue. If somebody drops out of the group, I will either pick up the character, put the character in his place, or kill off the character so for people who join and quit, it will not matter because the story will keep on going, even if there are only two members. I will be playing most of the characters and be in control of the main plot like a Dungeon Master. **However, to join my group I do not have one requirement: If one is to join my group, they have to be able to at least write a paragraph or more.** Once a person joins the group they have to read about the cities in this role play, which will be located in the Google Doc below. If one does not want to play as an original character then I also have character list, some of which already have face claims and others that do not have one, which is also located below. I cannot wait to see some of the auditions and hope to have to honor to write with you all. I hope you guys have a wonderful day!\n\n**If one is interested in joining the group, message me on Kik at gorillagrodd3299**\n\n\\-**Western Vengeance Cities:**  [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PjTVWDxrU0eg-kIh9RLwQsfcazaP-WL6BNmfnOiULmY/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PjTVWDxrU0eg-kIh9RLwQsfcazaP-WL6BNmfnOiULmY/edit) \n\n\\-**Western Vengeance Character List:**  [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k891fT44n1B54JzKIW4B8kkM7JCJht7ahaCx5foiqTA/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k891fT44n1B54JzKIW4B8kkM7JCJht7ahaCx5foiqTA/edit)",

I\u2019m also a fan of romance, as long as it\u2019s combined with another genre, but it\u2019s not necessary. I\u2019m also fine with NSFW \n\n\u2022I usually play a female OC, as that\u2019s what I enjoy the most. You, on the other hand, can play whatever you like! Cannon character, oc, male, female, whatever you prefer!\n\n\u2022I specifically am not a fan of slice of life, it\u2019s just not my thing. Other than that I\u2019m pretty much fine with anything, if you think something\u2019s too wild I\u2019d appreciate if you run in by me first. \n\nPM me if you\u2019re interested!",

            "selftext": "Hey everyone! It's been a while since my last post and I'm ready to dive back into roleplaying. I'll make this short and to the point! The Secret Society is a roleplay about a world where a small percentage of humans are born with a power of some sort. The story begins with our character's signing up for a fighting tournament being held by those with powers; only those with powers may enter--mainly because their powers must stay hidden from the government/public. Our characters can know each other, but they don't have to.  \n\n\nThe RP is meant to have more of a lighthearted beginning with a friendly (yet illegal) fighting tournament between those with powers, they are known as Oddities (Oddity singular). Slowly but surely the plot will become a descent into madness with much darker themes and all of that good jazz.  \n\n\nWhat I'm looking for in a partner:\n\n* 18+ in age!\n* 2-3 responses per day, minimum. If real life is getting in the way of this just let me know and I'll understand.\n* Literacy! At least a paragraph per response unless the scene doesn't call for it.\n* Just let me know if you're not interested in the RP. Ghosting is half the reason I took a break from RP.\n* Friendly OOC chat! This one isn't necessarily required but it's fun.\n* Able to flesh out a decent character. Also consider the drawbacks of having a particular power, if any. Makes the RP a lot more interesting if there's a personal struggle with one's power due to lack of training or just the nature of the power.  \n\n\nThat's it, really! If you're interested just shoot me a DM and we can discuss things further! Thanks for reading.",

            "selftext": "Hey r/Roleplay! So, I'm looking to start a semi-fantasy RP based in the MMO world of Maplestory, a cute little game that some might be familiar with if you played it throughout the mid-2000's.   \n\n\nTo give you the best idea of what we might be roleplaying, let me clear through a couple of things first.   \n\n\nWhy in the world would we set an RP in this game?: For me it's just a happy nostalgia rush that I think could be interesting to translate to roleplay.  I enjoy the simplicity of the in-game world that doesn't quite stick to one type of fantasy but meshes nicely. The game has changed so much over time, sometimes for the worst, and I'd like to see if I can milk any of that original enjoyment out of it through roleplay. Of course there are other things I plan to get out of this RP unrelated to the game that can be defined as your standard fantasy worldbuilding and character development but reenacting the joyous and sometimes vibes of this MMO would be a lot of fun to me.  \n\n\nWhat would we be doing in this RP?: I'd like to expand on the Maplestory world through OC's and see what we can come up with that follows the themes and genre of the original game. Neither the art-style nor the side-scrolling gameplay will be relevant to our RP and instead you can think of this as an anime-stylized RP set in the Maplestory world.  \n\n\nIs knowing all of the canon necessary?: Nope. In fact, the game has expanded so much over time that I'm hoping to focus on the core concepts of the game, which would include class the original Victoria Island classes, exploration, battle monsters and antagonists, and hopefully an overarching story. Knowing at least the base foundation of the game would help a lot but none of the add-ons nor extra content is super necessary for this.   \n\n\nI know this is highly specific and my chances of finding anyone who cares about this kind of RP are low but if for some reason any of this interests you, please send me a PM and we can talk more on Discord! Thanks!",

Character development is key. Ideally somebody 20 - 35 age bracket wise, with characters being around a similar mark.\n\nRather than just spats it\u2019ll be more serious \u2014 kin to writing a book together. A true story. The character trio I play have been around as long as I\u2019ve been roleplaying, around nine to ten years. The themes are dark, brutal in places and if our characters don\u2019t gel, I won\u2019t force a character change to get them to bond.\n\nLong replies are not necessary. Quality over quantity - I do narrate my characters and I expect roughly the same. This set of characters (three women of varying backgrounds, sexualities and bonds, all with side characters that will crop up. It is not for the faint of heart. Themes of substance abuse, violence and genuine horror are all common in my writing.\n\nRomance is on the cards if characters gel. It\u2019ll be a modern-realism type of deal, so no supernatural or other paranormal elements. All kinds of characters are welcome \u2014 I\u2019m female and based in the UK, online mostly everyday as I work from home. I enjoy collaborating and discussions, I invest in my stories and am looking for a partner that\u2019ll do the same.\n\nDM for Discord, character info, whatever.

I\u2019ve been having a hard time finding a decent partner to rp with. Just please while you take the time to read this give me to show you I can be a good partner. I have a couple of good plots I would like to try out if anyone is interested. If you have a plot that you would wanna try out I am open to that. I believe that when rping is something two people should be able to enjoy together so I\u2019m open to a lot of stuff. I wanted to combine genre of cyberpunk but give it like a yakuza twist to it. I have a few plot ideas for it that I wanna get out. If you are interested please",

I'm a long time roleplayer and novice writer - Roughly 7/8 years by now (although I know there are people here with twice that number of years under their belt).  \n\n\nCurrently, I'm searching for a partner, preferably 18+, that would be interested in a WW1 or WW2 themed, alternate-history scenario to roleplay in!  \n\n\nI do have my own alt-history world that I've built up and can use as a setting - But I am also completely open to creating something from the ground up together!  \n\n\nThe general plots/types of stories I'd be interested in doing, are basically open for discussion! War, slice-of-life, romance, ect. So long as it sounds good, and is set in that era of history, I'm down to give it a try! I myself prefer a more soldier-focused, military/war type of plot or story. But I know that's not everyone's jam, which is why I'm also open to discussing other ideas!  \n\n\nIf you're interested in something along the lines I've listed above, then feel free to shoot me a message and hopefully, we can get something set up!",

            "selftext": "  \n\nHi! You can call me Red. I\u2019m looking for a long-term partner for a complex, full-feature **character-driven story set in a historically-inspired medieval(ish) fantasy world** we can design together.\n\n***Availability***: Actively seeking to add one long-term writing partner to my list of regulars. I've recently returned to RP after a worklife absence, and my steady partner is busy with one of her own. So... perfect time to add friends!\n\n***Gender Restrictions:*** None. I often write for characters whose identities don\u2019t match my own, and believe your real identities are none of my business. (Unless you want to share that information and feel comfortable doing so, of course.)\n\n***Age Restrictions:*** 21+ (I ask that you respect my boundaries and do not reply to this posting if you are under 21. Thank you.)\n\n***Medium***: Discord or e-mail\n\n***Timezone***: Central Daylight / CDT\n\n***Frequency***: A few times a week, ideally, but I\u2019m low-stress. I\u2019ve got a wacky work schedule right now that can fluctuate wildly week-to-week; sometimes I can post multiple times a day, other times I may not be able to post at all for the whole workweek. I promise to always be respectful of your time constraints, and I ask that you are with mine, too. Don\u2019t be shy about letting me know if you need a break, be it for days or weeks or longer.\n\n***Themes of Interest***: Medieval fantasy. Some magic, supernatural creatures, and fantasy races are all fine by me, but not necessary.\n\n***Writing Style***: Third-person. I am looking exclusively for multi-paragraph novel/advanced literary roleplay, but I understand length should suit the situation. That in mind, I have no hard length expectations, but I tend to write anywhere between 500-1k words a post; if you fall around that general zone, we should be a cozy fit.\n\nQuality writing is a big deal to me. That said, RP is play, and nobody's dazzling all the time. As long as we both honestly care about our writing and our story, it's gold.\n\nI love the dark-dramatic, the comedic, and the joyful -- especially a mix between the three. I tend to write characters with BIG personalities\u2014people who are highly interactive and opinionated, but who take an investment to know on an intimate level. While I appreciate planning, chatting, and joking with my RP partners, I\u2019m not one to tell you everything about my characters before we start; I like the fun of surprise and discovery, and the thrill of tossing characters into a wild situation and seeing what emerges. ;)\n\nRomantic subplots are welcome, but not necessary. Please note I am not interested in writing explicit content.\n\n***Original Universes Y/N***: Absolutely, yes. I'd love for us to cobble our original elements together into something seamless and exciting. Many of my characters do come with fairly fleshed-out worlds behind/around them, but these characters are also designed to be flexible\u2014to export painlessly into other roleplayers\u2019 worlds. \n\n***Theme Blacklist and/or limits***: I'm not interested in writing for high-school-type environments. While I am comfortable including children and teens as important characters, my \"main\" character will always be an adult.\n\n***Writing Sample:*** Below is the first section of an unused starter from a match that didn\u2019t take off. Feel free to ask for the rest via PM. If you like, I\u2019d be totally fine using this prompt as \u201cour\u201d starter, but I\u2019m not married to it.\n\n&gt;The guest list was horrid.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;That is not, of course, to impugn the quality of the parchment or penmanship. (Lady Duchess Mabile von Claver spared no expense on her annual winter salons. The penmanship was excellent; the parchment was dusted in crushed gold filigree and sculpted into the shape of a tentacled sun.)   \n&gt;  \n&gt;What we are truly trying to say is that an unacceptable percentage of those names belonged to horrid people. Let us review a sampler, shall we?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;From the *Winter Salon Guest List*, Page Three:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Lord AUGUSTUS and Lady NARALIE BELLHOUSE**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Entrepreneurs of the Bellhouse Factory*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;(Lovely couple. If you could get past the indentured servants dying in their sweatshops to produce all sizes of glorious golden, steel, and silver-steeple bells. They donate a good deal to the *Slightly-Used Toys for Children Initiative*, though, so I suppose that\u2019s something.)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Lady MARINA VAN AIDENWELL VAN VACHALLE VON MURTOVA**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Socialite*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;(Trust no salon attendee simply addressed as \u201cSocialite.\u201d Lady Marina was a cat burglar and arsonist in employ of the capital, and she was a good one, too. In one word: a spy.)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Young Lord CUTHBERT**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Heir of Aidenwell*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;(Nineteen years of flamboyance, dice rolls, and plum perfume\u2014and every one of those years a curse upon this earth. If rumor was to be believed, his most recent legal embattlement involved the strangling of a seamstress. You are not advised to believe these rumors if you plan on withstanding the young lord\u2019s company for longer than twenty seconds.)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The Honorable SIR PAVELLE VAN IDUNVEIL**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Justice of the Middle-Court*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;(Known colloquially as *The Sawtooth\u2014*a ghost-eyed, uncomfortably handsome chickenhawk of a knight who had reputedly ordered more petty nobles\u2019 heads to the saw table than the Hacking Plague had sent to the graveyard. He also just had bitey-looking teeth.)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Lady JOHANNA GLOVERE**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Merchant Prince*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;(A husband-killing banker\u2014but otherwise, sweet as berry pie, and *very* cute. Dire enemy and\u2014naturally\u2014purported former paramour of He of Saw-y Teeth. Plays a mean game of backgammon. Charming singing voice.)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Lady WEATHERLY BLONDEAUX**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Globetrotter and Bounder Extraordinaire*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;(The famous writer. All writers are hobgoblins.)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**SIR BEATRICE**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;(Who really needed no other introduction. But if you must: *Sir Beatrice, The Orphan Butcher*.)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A catalogue of villainy. And those were just the locals. \n\n**CONTACT**: Don\u2019t be shy! I'm very friendly and you\u2019re welcome to send me a PM here on reddit. Even if we aren't able to work something out right now, it's always nice to have more writing nerds to chat with.\n\nPlease feel encouraged to send a little sample of something you\u2019ve written with your reply, as it\u2019s a great jump-start to figuring out if we have compatible styles. Any old snippet that represents the sort of creative writing you like to do is fine\u2014it doesn\u2019t have to be a sample for our hypothetical story.\n\n**Note: If response volume is high, I may not be able to reply to all inquiries.** For fairness, I try to address messages according to good fit + the order in which I receive them. Thanks in advance for your patience, and my apologies if it takes a minute to work my way to yours!",

I prefer to write fandom stuff, but will never shy away from an original idea.\n\nSome things about me:\n\n\\- I am 19. Meaning, you MUST be 18+ as well even if we decide not to write smut.\n\n\\- I've written stories almost my whole life, and am no stranger to the RP community.\n\n\\- I'm pansexual and totally okay with writing M x M, M x F, F x F, whatever.\n\n\\- I'm really easy going when it comes to writing length as long as it's generally over 3 sentences.\n\n\\- I love, love, LOVE writing romance (especially slow burn) and I am a huge fan of scifi and fantasy.\n\n\\- Generally speaking, I'm used to playing male characters and my philosophy is \"the grumpier the better\" but I'm flexible!\n\n\\- I like checking in with my RP partner occasionally; seeing where they would like the roleplay to go, etc. Otherwise I find it usually gets stale.\n\nWith that out of the way, here's a list of some fandoms I love to write in:\n\n(Characters I am familiar with playing will either be alone or at the *beginning* of a pairing)\n\n\\- Game of Thrones (Jaime Lannister x Brienne of Tarth, Sandor Clegane x Sansa Stark)\n\n\\- Harry Potter (Sirius Black, Severus Snape)\n\n\\- Doctor Who (Thirteenth Doctor x Yasmin, Ninth Doctor x Rose, Tenth Doctor x Rose)\n\n\\- Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency (Dirk Gently x Todd Brotzman)\n\n\\- The Man from U.N.C.L.E (Napoleon Solo x Illya Kuryakin)\n\n\\- Marvel (not up to date on comics and movies, but love the universe!) (Tony Stark x Steve Rogers)\n\n\\- Kingsman (Harry Hart x Eggsy)\n\nIf you don't see your fandom, feel free to ask me in a private message. I might have just forgotten!",

            "selftext": "Hello all! I've decided to go on a hunt for some roleplay partners. First, a bit about myself. \n\nI am a 20 year old girl who loves to create characters of all kinds and act out roleplays that are funny, romantic, and worth the time invested. While I do have my moments of business or tiredness, I am pretty free most the time. I roleplay in 3rd Person and my personal favorite genres are slice of life and/or modern fantasy mixed with romance. I'm not too picky on length but my comfort zone is 2-15+ lines depending on my level of creativity and how much the other person puts out. I do prefer LGBT roleplays although I can do straight roleplays. I prefer our characters to be able to change out on the who wears the pants role or for me to be the lesser pants wearer. Most of my characters are less masculine  or ambiguous. \nNow onto preferences for my partner. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMUSTS: \n\nMust be willing and able to have or create a decently fleshed out character. I have a character template that I use for my ocs if you need one. Character tropes are fine, although I take some issue with some but as long as they go beyond that trope and are their own person beyond 1 or 2 character traits, they're fine!\n\nMust have decent grammar and spelling. Now I know nobody's grammar or spelling is perfect, but I need to be able to understand what you're typing. \n\nMust reply at least every other day. I understand being busy and having times where you can't reply for a few days but id like to be notified if and when those things happen. I usually wait 4-7 days for someone to reply and will send the occasional 'hi' or 'hey' as a reminder. (Note: I also encourage you to be annoying to get me to reply. Sometimes I get distracted to the point of forgetting to reply or Discord won't send my reply or won't notify me when you reply. Send me reminders. If I ghost you it's never on purpose.) \n\nHave Discord.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEXTRA POINTS IF (you do not have to share these but it helps if you do)\n\nYou roleplay LGBT\n\nYou like multiple RPs, multiple characters to be going on at once (I LOVE polyamory)\n\nYou like talking and developing the RP as its happening\n\nYou are okay with rping as/with ocs who are mentally ill or physically disabled in some way. \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSend me a message telling me about you, what you like/don't like in a roleplay, and if you hit any of the extra points! I look forward to role-playing with you!! Please send the keyphrase \"Don't ask Don't Pas-tell\" somewhere in your message so I know you read through everything!",

            "selftext": "  \n\nHey! Would anyone be interested in playing a male OC character against a female OC character based around the Marvel/DC comics verse?\n\nI'm looking for something shippy. I don't want for our characters to know about each other's superhero identities. So perhaps they both tend to get into funny situations- where they see each other after detransforming back or a situation itself requires a superhero duty. Maybe, our characters are in love with each other and with each other's superheroes identities too, so they're sort of caught up in this love quadruple.\n\nI have a female OC character who is scientist. Her backstory can include a few TWs such as mental hospital. I can send you a backstory of hers once you message me to discuss the idea with me, if you want to find out more about her. You are also more than welcomed to headcanon and brainstorm the ideas for your own character too. Just that I'm looking for a character..\n\nI just thought that it'd be more fun to play with someone who's a bit like Johnny Storm character wise. Flirtatious and feisty, maybe he can be a doctor or scientist like her. They both meet each other for the first time when they're fighting someone as superheroes. But the actual time they both meet each other is through his brother and my character's friend. Your character's brother is a hacker/technology person for her superhero team, so like I said, imagine all the fun situations it could get them to and his brother knowing the truth entire time about both of them. (;\n\nI'm mostly looking for plot/world building, I'm fine with writing smut, if that's what you are looking for. Just make sure that there's at least a little bit of build up for that. I'm a multi-para to novella writer. I care about quality over quantity much more, so don't worry about having to match my length! I'm also very welcoming for your ideas if you may have some of yours! Don't be afraid to share them with me. &lt;3\n\nSo yes, please, hit me up if you would like to write together!",

Now, we don't need to play in the world itself, we can play in a homebrew medieval fantasy universe/world, but there are tidbits of it that's important to me. I wish to do a roleplay where our characters are powerful (Or at least, one of our characters are.) and travels worlds in the multiverse. Empowered by a spark within them, they have the power to jump between planes, going about their own business with their own goals - whether they're good or evil. I'd love to spitball ideas together, and thus I don't have any set ideas from the get-go. Now, this does mean that there's plenty of things we'll have to come up with on the fly, such as worlds and so. I will certainly come up with plenty, but I expect you to as well, this being a two-way street.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI enjoy different type of scenes - everything from adventuring, to travelling, to fighting and intrigue and the like - romance too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI play by Discord exclusively. I enjoy playing with fast responses, meaning I am not interested in replies done slowly throughout the day - I like sitting down to roleplay, with fast responses, but that of course also means roleplay won't be done every day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a descriptive male roleplayer looking for female characters, thus your IRL gender is of no matter to me, to create fun, entertaining stories with. 1-2 paragraphs per post is what I do, same range is expected from you. I require you to be 18+, since this will also include NSFW themes, which you must be fine with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to create stories together, same with plots. Lets make something together we'll both enjoy and have a lot of fun with. I prefer spit balling ideas, I do have some myself and feel free to bring some to the table too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also wouldn't mind doing something a little less grand scale, with say, Game of Thrones, or a more modern take on the idea with Marvel Cinematic Universe, so those are options too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf any interest, send me a PM with a Discord to add.",

            "selftext": "Hello, dear writer, and welcome to this mess of a post that is an attempt at grouping some ideas I've been wanting to play around!\n\nFirst, a bit about myself, just to give a warm welcome. I'm from Canada, EST, and I've been out of touch with my writer self in the past months. Lots and lots have happened, but here I am, ready to dive in wonderful plots once more!\n\nNow, for the actual interesting stuff. I've been craving some ideas, some character archetypes, some scenarios. I'll try to cover as much as I can, but by all means, feel free to tell me about your desires, and we'll build something we can both enjoy exploring! With my last post, I've found some partners, but I'm lacking something more... dynamic. Explosive. Sudden and dangerous. And this is where you shine! Here are, perhaps, some character archetypes that could interest you. They sure fill my heart with an unspeakable tension, and I hope we'll make something good out of it!\n\n* The Athlete; she's the cherry on top of her club. Her teammates admire her, she's the coach's favorite, and perhaps the boys have tried to approach her more than people would think. She's a bit of a tomboy with a booming energy, but that's exactly what MC fell for. This unstoppable force of nature easily broke through the thin walls of his heart, and from there, things escalate, at a pace that can be as slow as the passing of the seasons, or as rushed as the adrenaline in a dangerous situation.\n* The Punk; She terrorizes the campus, the school clubs, her workplace, whatever you want it to be. Her reputation might seem exaggerated, but she's the real deal. No one makes eye contact with that lioness. How many guys is she seeing? How many losers has she broken? And the real question, how does she end up with MC? Is he her favorite victim, her precious target? Or perhaps did they get paired up in a project? Let's discuss to find a bridge that is best suited to our desires.\n* The Tease/Bully; Oh, how she loves to tease MC. Perhaps she's been his friend forever, perhaps she happens to be a new classmate, or even worse, roommate. But is she just all talk? Something is about to explode somewhere. (This kind of tension can be mixed in with any other archetype easily!)\n* The Bruiser; A little similar to the Punk, in a less rebel way. She's in the army. She does combat sports. She grew up in a tough neighborhood, or she's worked for gangsters. Whatever the case, she's mostly mature, and so is MC. They're either college students, or they met through an app of some sort. Or perhaps are they colleagues? There's something about her that makes MC curious and interested. Is it the short, messy hair? The scars? What is it about her that makes him so... intrigued? Only one day to find out.\n\nAs you've maybe noticed, I have a preference for... well, strong female leads. The strength, the pride, the confidence in a woman's heart... it melts me, and it inspires me to write a vibrant story. I guess that parenthesis was necessary, in hopes that it helps you understand me better.\n\nSo long as this post is up, my DMs are open! Feel free to skate your way in, and either share your thoughts about the plots you've read or the ones that have been anchored deep in your mind for so long. I can't wait to meet you!\n\nP.S.: If you've read to the end, please include your favorite color in the title, thanks! &lt;3 I won't be mean if you forget, but I might poke about it, to be sure o: Also, if you've poked me before, feel free to do again! I sometimes forget, but trust me, I don't mean to hurt, I promise!",

I have been RPing for ten years, since I was thirteen, and prefer to write in third person and in past tense. \n\nI am looking for a partner who is 20+ and is okay with mature themes (not just lewd things, but darker themes in general). I usually post around 3-5 sentences per post, but I am not a stickler for post length. I usually take on the GM role, but am not married to the position. I do original roleplays and Fandom roleplays, but if in an established universe I prefer OC characters and plots. \n\nSome ideas!\n\nStar Wars: I would love to explore more of the gritty underworld of the Star Wars universe. I would prefer our story take place during the Old Republic, but am fine with right before the Original Trilogy as well. \n\nPersona: I have been playing a lot of Persona 5 lately, and would love to roleplay something a similar 1style (students at a school with daring secret lives, not necessarily stans or personas themselves.)\n\nMarvel: (MILD ENDGAME SPOILERS) I would really like writing about stories that were happening during the five year time skip, dealing with the fall out of half of the universe snapping out of existence. \n\nOther canon universes I enjoy: DC, Legend of Zelda, Mass Effect, Dragon Age, Harry Potter, and I play a lot of D&amp;D. \n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to shoot me a message and if you message me, make sure to include your favorite color!

            "selftext": "Hello everyone! I'm here with a 1 x 1 RP Search! I have been RPing for 17 years now (Since the time of the Yahoo Instant Messenger RPs!...before they got rid of the user rooms).\u00a0\n\nI have been searching for someone who can Roleplay as Vegeta from Dragonball Z. But heres the catch. I use an Original Character...but fear not! I don't make Mary Sue characters and I have been working on a full bio for my OC that I use just for the Dragonball franchise. It would be post Frieza Saga and go off in an Alternate Universe (no Trunks and the androids will probably come but it'll end up different) and it WILL be a romance! With action and adventure. Fights will be slightly included but if it gets too long we can time skip and try to figure out who is the winner between the characters.. Any more questions about this don't be afraid to ask me!\n\nNow, Rules... I am pretty lienient when it comes to Roleplays. Some literacy is a MUST. Of course we all make grammar mistakes (I know I make quite a bit as I look at myself typing this out lol). I do Semi paragraph to multi paragraph replies and starting posts as well full of detail. I would hope and wish that someone out there would be willing to do the same. also, this is in 3rd person. This will be romance like I have stated..but if you need to do a time skip through the lovey dovey bits please dont hesitate to tell me and we can time skip. Also...please DO NOT GOD MOD. its annoying.. Also...PLEASE BE ACTIVE. I know real life gets in the way and I'm understanding of that (trust me I work 40 hours a week I understand lol) I LOVE fast repliers they make me really happy trust me. If you get uninterested please just let me know I wont be mad I promise. also..PLOTTING. I love to plot out an idea that you might have or I might have before installing it into the RP. also about my OC I can tell you alot more about her if you are interested and I can even supply artwork of her as well.\n\nWell that seems to be the lot of it! I think I remembered everything...I hope I remembered everything lol. But please if you are interested hit me up with a PM or comment here and please don't be shy to ask me questions! I am always happy to answer any questions regarding everything I'm looking for. I hope I hear from someone!! Thanks!",
