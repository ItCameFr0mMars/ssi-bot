            "selftext": "Long, long ago, when the land of Alterria was young, there was chaos. Men were naught but beasts, and they treated eachother as such. There was no love, no camaraderie, no cooperation; only survival and might. The strongest warrior in this age long past was known as the King of Blades. It was said that he carried with him not one blade, but hundreds. He wore them like armor, his whole body was a terrifying menagerie of death-dealing instruments crafted by only the most skilled of bladesmiths. He wore the Crown of Knives, a device that seemed to give him supernatural mastery over the blades on his body. He was a whirlwind of steel and death. The King of Blades conquered all he encountered, defeated every foe. He came to rule Alterria. He was a benevolent king, but not a merciful one. His people loved and feared him like the Gods themselves. Through the strange magic of the Crown of Knives, he lived for three centuries... But one day, was finally felled in combat by an ambitious young warrior. This warrior became the Second King of Blades, and ruled the land of Alterria in his stead, taking the Crown of Knives for his own and in turn becoming warped by its magics. Many centuries have passed, and we now find ourselves in what it known as the Eighteenth Age, ruled by the Tenth King of Blades-- a cruel, mad king. He rejects the title of the Tenth King of Blades, instead demanding he be called something else entirely; the Last King. Many have tried and failed to remove the Last King from power, but on the battlefield he is death itself. His blades are the wind, they sever and decimate all who meet his eye. He has ruled already for four centuries, and all the land is under his grasp. He studies the magic of the crown, learns its secrets. He wishes to be its final scholar-- an ascendant who will inherit all creation through its strength. And yet, even in these darkest of times... The embers of hope still shine.\n\n---\n\nHello! I'm looking for someone to play out an RP in this original fantasy world of mine over Discord. I play in 3rd person, and am looking for an active and descriptive partner to undertake the task of dethroning the Last King with me! I'm open to all sorts of things regarding plots, characters, and worldbuilding, and am hoping to make contact with someone as enthusiastic about these things as I am. If you have an original fantasy setting of your own, or are interested in writing fantasy within an existing fandom universe, I'd love to hear what you have to say as well. Please send me a message if you're interested-- thank you!",

I want to practice GMing some more, so that my regular players have a more fun experience. I\u2019ve also wanted to try GMing in a text roleplay style. \n\nAs I\u2019ve said, I\u2019m fairly experienced. I\u2019m looking for a player with a little experience to play with over the summer. I\u2019d like to extend it past that, but school keeps me incredibly busy.  A little warning, I might not be able to be on every day (vacations and moving a house are currently my priority). \n\nAs for what style it will be, I\u2019ll leave that up to you. I\u2019m extremely experienced with fantasy, especially medieval fantasy. What ever we do, I\u2019d like magic or something similar to be a factor. As for my specific GMing style, I focus mostly on enjoyable, often times silly, NPCs. I love making these little people, each with their own personality. After that, I enjoy expanding worlds and showing the effects magic has on the world. \n\nReposted because I put this post on the wrong account previously.",

I am of age (18, turning 19 this July) and I will ask that you be 18+ *if* you wish to roleplay NSFW. I'm very lax, easygoing, and not hard to get along with. RPing has been a part of my life for about 10 tens years now, so I am familiar with the concept of it. I have no particular set of guidelines for potential RP partners, however, I do ask that we treat each other with mutual respect and patience!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn RPs, I can roleplay as both male and female- I have no preference. \n\nI am open to ANY suggestions that you may have, but these are just a few ideas that intrigue me and things that I like!\n\n* Fandoms (Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is currently what I'm into, but you're more than welcomed to suggest other ones, I have no preference over RPing canon characters or OCs.)\n* Mafia-based (Italian, Russian, etc- just really like the concept of gangsters!)\n* Action, drama- give me all the angst and plot!\n* Realistic scenarios\n* Interesting characters (flawed, believable, ones that draw me in!)\n* Long-Term RPs (I am very patient and can wait! I understand that life comes first, always.)\n\nThere's so, so much more that I'm into RPing and I really hope that you all can find something you're interested writing with me! If you think that you have a group RP that I may be interested, I am also open to that and you're free to message me! Please DM me for my Discord tag if you're interested.",

            "selftext": "**The story part**    \nI have quite fond memories of roleplaying in a Soul Eater (anime) universe. More specifically, I would like to write again in a Meister/Weapon context. Essentially, two very different people meeting, learning about each other, learning to fight together, going on adventures, becoming close friends. I\u2019d like it if one of them had a darker aspect to their personality, just so we could have some conflict. Alternatively, I\u2019m happy if your character was someone else rather than a partner, such as a mentor-like figure, or even a friendly witch.     \n\n**The practical parts**    \nNo smut, no romance (one-sided is ok), no GoT-/Berserker-level adult or dark themes.    \nFor Weapons/Meisters, I\u2019d prefer them being aged 18 to 30, and having our characters within a few years of each other.    \nI write slowly. Waiting multiple days is pretty typical, with the occasional week or more. The fastest I can do is once a day.    \nI write in multi-paragraph format. My average is about 500-700 words per post, but I can comfortably go higher or lower depending on the situation and my rp partner\u2019s style. However, I cannot go comfortably under two paragraphs or over 2000 words (occasionally, yes, but not repeatedly).    \nI\u2019m not saying you have to do the same, but please try to write at least two paragraphs. ^^    \nThe platform I prefer is googledocs.        \n\n**The new part aka I have no idea what I\u2019m doing**    \nI\u2019d like to test another way of doing things, if you\u2019ll indulge me.    \n\nFrankly, I\u2019m a bit tired of sorting through messages, putting effort into calculating how many threads I can afford to invest my time in, discussing plot in detail and then ending up with far fewer threads than I originally imagined (largely due to ghosting).    \n\nSo instead, I\u2019ll post two prompts. One for my Weapon character, another for my Meister. If you\u2019re interested, just shoot me a PM for one of them with what you\u2019d write in reply! I\u2019m putting a limit of 500 words max at first, because I don\u2019t want to pressure people too much. No need to hurry. I\u2019m happy to discuss details ooc too.    \n\nMy weapon character starts out as a Kishin Egg. That pretty much marks her out as a target to be killed; however, her Weapon abilities are also awakening. Hypothetically, that could stop the development of her madness; however, who would trust her at this point? That\u2019s where your character comes in. Presumably the story would start out with some sort of fight, then redemption arc, a la Crona.    \n\nOn the opposite, my Meister character is fairly normal. However, I\u2019d prefer it if her partner was the one with the dark aspect. Maybe a ninja that wishes to serve their family, even in more morally grey or outright black ways? Maybe a bloodthirsty berserker? Maybe a stuck-up noble? My character could provide a supportive shoulder and a moral compass, while learning that the world is more complex than she wishes, and that sometimes caring about people is difficult.    \n\n**Weapon prompt**    \n(warning: rather dark themes in terms of graphic violence)\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1aHhCizFCIHhJx0d2drLPmDiJBOXTII8MVDN4M1lE0RY/edit?usp=sharing\n \n\n**Meister prompt**    \nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1Sm3LPJpZnP2zk9m4G8Z1p1BTN2uD9AsdptlNhBtmcso/edit?usp=sharing\n\nPlease send a PM if interested (no reddit chat; I use OldReddit)!",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone, \n\nI\u2019m back, looking for possible new long-term partners for the future. I\u2019ve been really wanting to write creatively and I\u2019m only involved in one other plot, so I have some open time. I\u2019m 21 years old, so please be 18+. And I\u2019m in EST, but I\u2019m always up very late. Being literate as well would help me. I\u2019m not looking for the next J.K. Rowling here, just someone who writes 2-4 paragraphs (relative to what a paragraph entails) and minimum spelling errors. Just help me write the story!\n\nNow onto my plot. It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve dealt with anything revolving a relationship. I\u2019m not going crazy here, I\u2019m looking for a slow-burn kind of romance, with a specific theme in mind. We\u2019re both musicians, in a festival, what I\u2019d be calling the \u201cSummer Jam Sessions Festival.\u201d Basically, we\u2019ll both create a little character (or multiple if you\u2019re feeling up to a challenge!) that\u2019s a musician, and we\u2019ll slowly hang out more and more, and hopefully fall more and more for each other. I think a festival idea, can involve a Warped Tour kind of tour list, just being a few days (probably the three weekend days) in each major city. Allowing for some involvement with music (my favorite thing in the world) in the festival, also making sure it doesn\u2019t get boring with some possible fun, and romantic city adventures! \n\nNow, I\u2019m not always amazing at describing what I want, as I tend to just ramble on, and on. So, if you have any questions about what I want, please feel free to ask. A slow-burn romance is the important part to the reader, but we can make it as much about our musical talents as well. I\u2019ve just noted most people enjoy music, but have no clue about the development, or any other process, so pretending to be a musician may be hard. \n\nI would like to do this on Discord, although if you\u2019re extremely interested perhaps we can make something else work! Leave your Discord if you use the application, and want to try it out. \n\nIf you also have no interest being a musician, just say so and we can make something up, which would actually be very fun! Hope to hear from you soon. If not, have a lovely night!",

            "selftext": "Cold gusted from the chilled bar top in waves and Sam sniffed at her drink. Condensation trickled from the glass and dribbled down her wrist.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t smell like whiskey,\u201d she said, fighting the urge to wrinkle up her nose. It didn\u2019t *look* like whiskey either. It was a virulent shade of orange, sparkling under the pink overhead lights as she rolled it around crushed ice. The barman snorted, the expression twisting his ghost-white face.\n\nHe\u2019d never seen the sun. Space colony born and raised.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t sell whiskey, earth girl. We sell *wisky.\"*\n\nHe pronounced the word like he was spitting it.\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nSam felt her face burn a little. She had assumed it was a spelling mistake.\n\n*Because colonists are idiots?* She could almost hear her brother in her head. *Because they're illiterate?* He'd always been the one that cared about colonists, their rights, the one who'd fought in protests and made the news as the rich boy who cared. Sometimes she defended him. Sometimes she fought with him just as much as their parents.\n\nThe barman gave a thin smile that could have been one of contempt or of sympathy.\n\n\"*Oh*,\" he agreed. \"Careful there, earth girl. *Wisky* ain't for sippin'; you ain't used ta it, you'll be on the floor in a half hour's time.\"\n\nShe nodded before he moved to serve the next patron, eyeing her drink warily. If she wasn't sat alone, she might have snapped at him. 'Earth girl,' he said. Like it was an insult. *At least I wouldn't be an alien on my own home planet.* She allowed her mind to wander back to her brother.\n\n*What would you think of me now?* Sam wondered to herself. *Woukd you be proud? Sat in a colonist bar with a colonist drink.* She doubted it. He had always hated the backpackers who tried out colony life 'as a gimmick.' Sam had always looked down on them too; if only because she couldn't understand why you'd dirty yourself with space rabbits in the name of soul searching. *Well, I'm here because of you, Ben. You went running and I'm chasing. Maybe I'll reach you before dad does. Maybe I'll even reach you before you kill yourself for a cause that doesn't even benefit you.*\n\nShe crossed and uncrossed her legs, trying not to twinge at the icy droplets splashed on her thighs. Her skirt and blouse had been perfectly fine for her quarters. The upper side of *Concordia*, a 12 million strong space station, catered broadly to botanists, biologists and businessmen - temperate, polished and beautiful. The lower was the working side, the side that supported that 12 million- well, 12 million being the official statistic. If rumour were to be believed (and she did believe it) most working-class colonists rejected the one child limit without a permit. Regardless, the less affluent sectors were either freezing cold or boiling hot depending on their distance from the engines. The bar she'd been asked to meet at, the Blue Dandelion, verged on the former.\n\nSam shivered and glanced around. At 6pm most of the people were workers coming off their shift and still in uniform. None dressed in emerald-and-gold blouses and leather skirts. None with the freckled skin of an Earther or salon pampered blonde hair.\n\nAnd none of them appeared to be the who she'd gotten the message from, responding to her note on the port's message board asking for information from anyone who had seen Ben. Or maybe they were- she couldn't tell. She couldn't tell anything on this glorified space rock. \n\nShe sniffed at her drink again and in a bout of frustration fueled courage, swallowed a mouthful. And promptly descended into a coughing fit. *Oh good lord.*\n\n**DONE**\n\nWant to come chat to an idiot Earther in a bar? Want to advise her on a drink more to her tastes? Want to tell her you've seen her brother? Want to stab her? Anything's fine!\n\nPlease shoot a message if you're interested. Whether this is a one off short term writing exercise together or it turns into a long-term thing, I just want to have fun creating something with you. This is generic sci-fi, no worldbuilding done from what I've written here, so feel free to just write a response. Hope to hear from you!",

If the original author reads this ad, I offer you tremendous thanks for sharing such an interesting idea.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe premise would revolve around two students, one male, one female, who, despite both being popular and friendly in their own circles, see each other as extreme rivals and are very hostile. Perhaps both applied to the same position in the student union. Perhaps a petty bit of upstaging escalated so now they continually try to mess with each other. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDue to a housing administration error or just plain bad luck, the two would find themselves as flatmates for the next year of their studies. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs well as this, each would also be avid players of a popular MMO, but keep this a secret from their friends and most importantly, each other. I think it could be a very entertaining roleplay to tell the story of these characters, who are so opposed to each other in real life, but are very close friends in game without realising. There would be many supporting characters to interact with, both in game and in real life. There are alot of ways we could take this RP and iron out the details, so we'll have to discuss it for a little while before we start.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI normally write 200-500 words a response, and while I dont expect my partner to match me exactly, I would like each reply to be at least over 100 words. I roleplay exclusively on discord.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDont hesitate to ask any questions in the comments below so others might read them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks, I look forward to hearing from you.",

But on to business!  As stated in the title, I'm looking for another writing partner.  I'm a 29 year old male myself, and would prefer if you were 21+.  I don't have a preference for your gender, or your character's, but tend to do mxf pairings if romance is involved.  I do plan on including NSFW themes like violence, language, and adult situations, but I prefer to fade to black when it comes to explicit sexual content.  Basically, let's keep it rated R rather than NC-17.  My posts tend to be between 2 and 3 paragraphs, but are dependent on the scene.  If you post more, I'll do my best to match!  I'm on PST, and can post at least once a day, and often more frequently.  I'd love a partner who was also frequently available, but I do understand real life comes first.  I do my roleplay through discord, as the servers are really handy for keeping everything organized.\n\nWhen it comes to settings and plot lines, I'd say that I am currently most interested in a Medieval Fantasy or a Medieval realistic setting.  That said, I could be open to modern fantasy, or something sci-fi based off either Fallout or one of the Love, Death, and Robots episodes.  I usually play male characters, but I'd be open to mixing that up, or would really love a partner who is open to us each playing multiple characters, as well as NPCs to really flesh out the narrative.\n\nFeel free to ask me any additional questions you may have!  I'd also really appreciate it if you have a writing sample available, and I'll of course be happy to provide one of my own.  Have a delightful day!",

I figured I'd try this out as I'm interested in trying something that interests me very much, and I haven't been able to find many whom are into creepy, bizarre, 'keep you up at night' sort-of stories. So, let's jump into some tips, and what I'm looking for!\n\nSo, just a few things about me. I've been roleplaying for roughly ten plus solid years. I have a paragrapher, mirror, and storytelling playstyle. I'm a twenty-four, male who works nights at a hospital. I have what is called a 'Panama' schedule. I work two on, two off. Three on. Two off. Two on. Three off. This repeats. I mainly would be roleplaying with you while at work. I work gruesome twelve hour shifts, and after my work is completed time is still in over abundance. I use Discord, and would not mind PMing it to you. Feel free to DM me if you're more comfortable with that instead of posting here. I do not mind!\n\nAs for the story, I'm looking to do something that's adrenaline inducing, heart pumping, and invoking in a sense of, \"I'm in danger!\" As for the theme - it could be classic slasher, pure fantasy, urban legend, and so on. I'm willing to work with you if you're willing to work with me! I'm open to all aspects of horror. We can make this story as original as possible, or make it a fandom. I am also capable of playing the roles of multiple characters at any given time. We can also add more than just us to the story if you know of anyone who may be interested. \n\nI only speak English, and use proper grammar. I also am a comma w**re so beware! I have a great sense of humor, and would love to get creative with any whom are like-minded. Feel free to post!\n\nP.S: As of writing this it's 23:45 (11:45 PM CDT). If we share the same timezone, great! If not, we can work around it! Thanks for reading.",

It is four stories tall, the first floor holding faculty offices, the gym, cafeteria, etc. The second floor holding the first-year classrooms, third holding the second-year classroom, and the fourth being for third-years. The gym and athletic facilities are top-notch and one of the best in the nation.\n\nHello! I am the owner of the Okinogawa High School rp. We had recruited a few people before, but our numbers shrunk due to inactivity, so we\u2019re opening the server back up! We are looking for 5-8 ACTIVE members to come take part in the little world my mods and I have created completely from scratch! We offer friendly mods, creative freedom in terms of backstory and character creation, multiple rp ares, lore, multiple IC romance/friendship opportunities, bots, friendly members, and much much more! Anyways, please send me a pm if you\u2019re interested! I hope to talk to you all soon!!!",

            "selftext": " \n\nHey there! I've recently found myself with some increased free time coming up and am therefore on the hunt for another roleplay. At the moment I've got a vague character concept that is rattling around in my head and that hopefully can be built into a more solid plot.\n\nThe concept could be modified for several different settings but revolves around someone who at a very young age was sent to live with another family as a ward of sorts. It was talked about like it had been both families' idea, but everyone knew the truth: the child was essentially a political hostage. Maybe her family had been implicated in some sort of plot? When I originally started dreaming this one up there was elements of noble families involved but like I said, it could be modified in various ways. Anyhow, after many years have passed and the child has grown into an adult she is finally returned to her family and live the life she was supposed to lead. Obviously there is a lot of potential for political intrigue and just general drama -- how does her upbringing affect how she sees things now and how she is perceived by her family and everyone else around her?\n\nAnyways, like I said it's a very rough character concept at the moment but something I thought it might be enjoyable to explore. Hopefully someone has some ideas that can help shape this into some sort of plot. I'm excited to come up with something we'll both enjoy!\n\nJust a tiny bit of housekeeping details before I end this post -- I'm female and well above 21 so please be of age as well. I tend to get along better with older roleplayers. At the very least please understand that I have a job and real life responsibilities. Similarly I will of course respect your schedule. If you are looking for someone to do rapid-fire posting or multiple replies per day you will not find that here. I write in 3rd person, past tense, preferably on discord and my posts are at least 2-3 paragraphs. OOC talk/chatting about the plot/etc is wonderful and encouraged.\n\nToday and tomorrow are going to be a bit sporadic for me but I will do my best to reply to any PMs I get as quickly as possible! And I figure we would need time to plot things out anyways. Thanks for reading!",

I prefer potential partners to be 21+, but 18+ works fine, and I prefer to roleplay over Discord, but I could settle for Reddit PMs or Gmail.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested, drop me a line on Reddit and we\u2019ll see what we can do.\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\nThese prompts are a bit shorter and are heavily influenced by the Good Omens series, though you don't need to be a fan to appreciate them, I have them fleshed out in more detail and am happy to detail them or work with you to come up with others.  \n\n\nI would describe them as romance/slice of life/supernatural/modern fantasy.\n\n1. An Angel and a Demon, lifelong rivals from the beginning of time, are both trying to convert one of the world's most powerful CEO's to their bidding, but when one side uncovers that the game is rigged, can they convince their frenemy to cooperate?\n2. A fortune teller that has never been wrong makes their first mistake shortly after a mysterious resident moves in next door. We can discuss what that might be at your leisure.\n3. A witch with stunted powers stumbles across a much more powerful warlock. He offers to teach her, only to discover there's a curse blocking her powers from fully blossoming. The two go on a journey to reverse it.",

            "selftext": " \n\nHi all\n\nFirst things first: my name is Dan :)\n\nI am trying to get back into the play-by-post scene like in the good old days of Nation States where a bunch of people would gather on a Zetaboard / Invisionfree forum and just role play how a country works, all with a parliament, government, military, etc.\n\nI have tried to build a forum that would simulate historical scenarios but while I was working on it I realized this format goes much better in a \"whole nation\" sort of way. Simulating an entire country instead of small, local scenarios (a battle for example).\n\nSo this is what I am trying to do. I am putting up together a message board at [https://www.vaintopia.com/forum](https://www.vaintopia.com/forum) where a city-state named Vaintopia will run its existence, completely with a currency system, a functional government and parliament, real-estate, diplomacy, etc. I plan on doing a PVE sort of thing with players reacting and fighting against written events that would try and destabilize Vaintopia (or not, not all events are negative) but the idea is to have continuous engaging with the players. There should be always something to do. For example, I was thinking that as soon as I get a small active playerbase there will be a struggle between the Republic or the Monarchy (as in the beginning there is no official head of state).\n\nWhat I am looking for - role playing gamers (or practicants?) that can help with advice, give input, do some testing around, see the general feel of the whole deal.\n\nSo, if anyone feels like joining / playing please PM me and we can chat more about the whole thing. \n\nMany a thanks and have a great weekend.",

I'm going to be an open book here and try out anything RP wise you're currently craving, with a few exceptions that I'll talk about right now.   \n\n\nNo purely slice of life, I can guarantee I'll grow bored of that. That doesn't mean I don't enjoy slice of life moments in RP, but only slife of life I won't do. This second one is I prefer playing male characters. I can and will play female characters, but I'm more inclined to go male. That's it, essentially one exception if you think about it...   \n\n\nNow I'll be talking about what I'm looking for in a partner:\n\n* 18+ in age\n* Literate.\n* A paragraph per response, minimum.\n* 2-3 responses a day. If you can squeeze in more, that's even better! I understand life gets in the way so if you can't do 2-3 a day or even can't respond, just let me know and I'll understand. We all have busy days.\n* Friendly OOC. This one isn't necessary but a huge bonus!\n\nThat's about all I can think of, for now. I do have a few rules I'll be going over in DM's. If you're interested, shoot me one and we can get to discussing them and fleshing out ideas for a roleplay! Thanks for reading :\\^)",

            "selftext": "Hi everyone! Im currently looking to so a long term superhero/vigilante roleplay the story will center around your character being recruited to join a team of heroes of various ages and backgrounds, and slowly becoming the greatest heroes the world has ever seen.\n\nIve done many roleplays in the past, hut this is one I'm particularly excited for, as i love superheroes/mythology. I love building a universe and building lore for for it, and i especially love stories about people rising up to do good in a world where people tell them that they cant.\n\nSo what can you expect from this roleplay? Action, drama, romance, and much more. As the GM I will he playing multiple characters, all of whom will be unique and interesting, and I'm not just talking about powers. Ill be taking lots of inspiration from other comics, and I will do my best to keep you hooked. \n\nThe stories will be divided into chapters, each chapter will focus on character development; characters will die, and others will be introduced, and the villains will test the heroes in ways you cant even imagine.\n\nIm purposefully being a little vague here... for more details, dm me! I can roleplay on discord or kik, and i look forward to hearing from you soon! If you text me please describe your characters powers and a short description of them fighting crime or saving someone.",

            "selftext": "This isn't going to be nearly as flashy or in-depth as some of the others I've seen on here when looking for examples on how to design my own; partially because I'm not experienced enough in using handles, partially due to an admitted disinterest. In that same vein, I'll try and present whatever someone might find interesting or important to know if they'd want to pick up on this.\n\nAs the title gets across, I'm invested heavily into the idea of narrators - DMs, GMs, whatever your flavor of word - speaking onto a player in a world of their own creation - which, in this case, without a system, though I've no issue with someone taking inspiration from the likes of D&amp;D or Pathfinder - preferably one that they feel a good amount of sentimental pride in rather than just something manufactured for the purposes of having something to work with. In more poetic terms; I'm not-so much looking for the log cabin someone built for their family from scratch so much as I am the dream house that they fantasized about since they were kids; full of colorful characters, locations, unique and distinguishable cultures and nations that stand out amongst them. Atop that, I'm a fan of 'niche,' topics when it comes to worldbuilding that isn't obvious or can be observed in the same way one would see with their eyes - economics. Trade. These sorts of theories that live to justify why a world is the way it is rather and thus aggravating someone's ambitions and ideals whether they be on a national wide scale and thus a matter of policy, or something more personal and lead. The distinction would be, really, in what sort of story is being told?\n\nIs it a politically oriented story of the player acting as someone that, in one way or another, stumbled their way into wielding official power and all the influence that implies? That, ideally, would mean having a world that's truly flushed out itself in terms of the bounties and resources provided by the planet and what countries decide to do with them and how that justifies how they interact with one another - I have a pretty profound love for military fiction and often try to get as in-depth with it as much as I can. On that note; when I say 'medieval,' I do mean that pretty strictly. I'm talking sword, fire, and trebuchet being the most innovative things around. Magic might provide some form of alternative form of medium for science in war or otherwise, but, typically speaking, magic realistically - and ought to unless given a rationale otherwise - be a detriment to the progression of science and technology, not a benefit to it.\n\nIf it's a more off the rails adventure of a one-person army; whether it be a violent story or not? Make it a grand adventure, a road trip of sorts with a character whose intent is exploration of the world and finding every underbelly and secret it has. Full disclosure? I'm pretty big on violence. Not in sexual terms, but genuine, 'these two or more objects want to end the other's life,' sort of situations and their depiction. I'm a pretty big advocate of pacifism in real life, but I'm totally happy to use my darker tendencies to replicate harsh, brutal bloodshed through the medium of writing whether it be against monsters, humans, humanoids, the civilized and the uncivilized - whatever. A proper adventure needs no greater motivation than the urge to continue it. There really needs to be no greater plot or urgency to the story other than to see what'll happen next. That being said? There can be a greater ambition as the story goes on, perhaps even morphing into a political story of an adventurer-turned-warlord ala Pathfinder D&amp;D. Some of my favorite stories are about Kingmakers who carve out their realm with their own two hands.\n\nUh. I'dunno. Running out of steam at this point admittedly - shout out to Christina Applegate. Discord's cool - feel free to ask for it if you'd want to use it for OC chatter or arpee. You'll find it in my signature. Yup. Pretty sure that's about it. Peace.",

Echo 4 is covered in lush jungle and is just waiting to be discovered. We have a unique Archetype system in place to make character creation interesting and allow everyone to be included in RP. We host special missions into the jungle, where everyone who wants to be involved will play a special part in the overarching story of the server. Of course, special missions won't be the only time you can explore the planet. You can enter the jungles any time you want (but hopefully you've gained authorization from High ranking officers, otherwise you might get into trouble!!). When you do venture into the jungle- alone (not recommended) or in groups (super fun totally recommend)- there is a fun random encounter system in place to help you RP that you can choose to use. Each expedition into the jungle can bring random fun to everyone there- whether it be discovering new creatures, or surviving the perils of uncharted terrain, there's something for everyone. \n\nIt's a brand new server, but please feel free to join!

I\u2019ve been roleplaying for about 8 or 9 years now, and write almost exclusively with other Women by preference. My writing style is a paragraph style, third-person, past tense, novella format. My typical post length ranges from 2-5 paragraphs, with more or less depending on the demands of the scene. I\u2019m from the UK, and I work full-time, my Time Zone is GMT, and I typically tend to be available in the evenings.\n\nWhat I\u2019m looking for in terms of roleplay is someone who shares my sort of writing style, and would like to collaborate ideas together! I have a few basic outline ideas that I would much rather refine down with my partner to find something we both put our hearts into! I absolutely would also love to make friends OOC as I find that makes talking about the plot and writing together much easier. I should add as well that I do have quite a fondness for adult themes, so I\u2019d require any partners to be 18 or over!\n \nNow onto my ideas! I have a mix of a few modern and more fantasy settings to choose from, in also open to taking ideas from my partners! \n- A modern setting with more of a horror twist - I love to explore horror and themes of tension and suspense, so what I thought of for this idea is something set in a haunted house, with plenty of twists and turns!\n- A little bit of a cliche indulgence - I\u2019d love to explore a boarding school plot! Something that could draw from a lot of high school anime themes, something that can be fun and wacky with plenty of funky turns!\n- Fantasy End Times - I\u2019ve played a lot of Dark Souls lately and I adore the aesthetic and tone of a dark fantasy world on the brink of collapsing and ending. I\u2019d love to explore some adventuring characters, trying in vain to stop the end of the world, or just survive it!\n- Ninja Fantasy - that\u2019s all I really have for this, fantasy and ninjas, something potentially with Soul Calibur influence could be wonderful, but that\u2019s not an absolute necessity!\n \nThat\u2019s it for the base ideas I had, I\u2019d love to build on and explore them further with any interested folks! \n\nMy preferred platform is Discord, if you\u2019re interested drop me a private message telling me a little about yourself and what you\u2019d like to write, (maybe even your favourite way to wear your hair just so I know you\u2019ve read this) and we can go from there! If you wanted to give me ideas of your own as well that\u2019s wonderful too!\n \nThank you for your time, I can\u2019t wait to hear from anybody interested!\n~ Xhunghukthu// Call me whatever x",

Our plot is set in a far future where the governments brutal control has forced many people to follow illicit paths. Hardcore criminals who step out of line in this society, are sent to the Hyperion Prison. This place is a massive space station that is located in orbit of Saturn's moon Titan. Several of other planets in the solar system have been colonized in this roleplay but we will only focus on what happens inside the prison. Throughout the solar system, this confinement is known for broadcasting the Hyperion Games where inmates fight each other and put their real lives at stake in hopes of lowering their sentences. Essentially the prison serves as a major human guinea pig factory, but of course, we wouldn't want the government to know that.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Hyperion Falls is inspired by (but not based on) various sources such as \"Love, Death &amp; Robots\", \"Neuromancer\", \"Electric Dreams\", \"The Expanse\", \"Hunger Games\" and many other sci-fi stories.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt; **EXPECTATIONS** \n\nThis is a mature roleplay and we allow all sorts of violent and explicit content. We are also very LGBT+ friendly with several staff members who fall under the rainbow umbrella. We do not condone any form of harassment, hate speech or discrimination. This is a laid-back roleplay where you are not expected to reply every day. We value your time in our ooc chats just as much.   Every month, we will also have a writing contest for those who sign up.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt; **WHERE TO FIND US** \n\nInformation about this roleplay can be found on our website: [http://hyperionfalls.net/](http://hyperionfalls.net/)  \n\nClick here to join our server: [https://discord.gg/ZpDXfAh](https://discord.gg/ZpDXfAh)",

            "selftext": "Bolin stood still by the row of lockers within the training stadium, his eyes transfixed on a certain figure several lockers away.\n\nHe never seen anyone from the Water Tribes here in Republic City. He never expected the first person from there he'd meet would be so... attractive.\n\n\"You *do* know that if she sees you gawking at her like that, I'm not getting myself involved, little brother,\" Mako said next to him, their lockers adjacent to one another. He lifted his Pro-Bender helmet off and placed it inside before tending to his other gear.\n\nBolin was unable to break his eyes off to meet his brother. \"I'm sorry, Mako. It's just that...\" he chewed the inside of his mouth, considering, before he continued, \"There's something really about her that I just can't stop thinking about.\"\n\nHe watched as she cracked her knuckles before proceeding to stretch her limbs while looking as if she was enjoying it. Including the just-audible-enough cracks echoing the locker room.\n\n\"Funny,\" Mako said, closing his locker door, \"I always saw you more as the kind of guy to go for the more,\" he coughed into his gripped fist, \"vapid fangirls type.\"\n\n\"I know right?\" he said, with no sense of shame or modesty. He watched from afar, admiring not just her physical attractiveness, her fit and toned body, with a endearing smirk to boot, but how she overall just radiated this 'confidence' around her. \"But... she's different.\"\n\nSuddenly, as she went to rotate her neck, she caught a glimpse of Bolin looking at her across the room, past several lockers.\n\n \u201cWhat ya staring at?\u201d She asked, her voice playful enough to come off as friendly, but with enough emphasis for both Bolin and Mako to know why she was coming over. \n\nBolin froze up, speechless.\n\nKorra managed to give a small yet noticeable wink to the earth bender.\n\nMako leaned in from behind and amusingly whispered into his ear. \"Well, good luck with her.\"\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHey there.\n\nSo, I'll admit this is the third and likely last time I'm posting this due to my two previous partners unfortunately not replying (after over a month now) which really is upsetting since I genuinely thought we were great writing partners and were quite invested in it and then... silence. Welp :P\n\nIn any case, I'm looking for a partner who's interested in playing Korra\u2014a character who's strong, independent, confident, stubborn, and then some, all traits that I find awfully attractive personally\u2014and willing to, well... [reciprocate some feelings with Bolin (art by StrawberryTiger)](https://i.imgur.com/8VwA1i9.jpg)\n\nI can't help but relate with someone like Bolin who tries to act all cool and confident only to come off as awkward and a try-hard. That it's revealed that he's really just a softy behind his facade.\n\nRegarding the story, I think the backdrop would be Season One, Korra arrives and recently joins their Pro Bending team. I'm more than open to including some adventure-action into it (i.e. maybe bumping into some Triad gangsters). But other than that, the roleplay should mainly revolve around dates and awkward romantic shenanigans.\n\nWe can discuss and roleplay through Discord, Google Hangouts, Reddit PMs or Chat, or Google Docs.\n\nIf any of this interests you, hit me up with an Orange Letter and we can discuss where this goes from here :)",

I'm up for both cannon and AU roleplays, yet my preference is to keep cannon ones before the Greed Island arc, as I'm at the episode 59 of 2011 series yet.\nMost genres are fine, except for anything related to sexual content. Romance is also not preffered, while fluff and bromence are completely fine. It can be both light or dark; serious or not.. I'm completely fine with darker themes; angst and gore(even whump), for example. As literacy, again, all are fine: Yet highly prefer semi-lit.\nI'd rather not to roleplay with OCs. \n\nIf anyone is interested, or has any questions, please DM me or comment under this post.",

Now, we don't need to play in the world itself, we can play in a homebrew medieval fantasy universe/world, but there are tidbits of it that's important to me. I wish to do a roleplay where our characters are powerful (Or at least, one of our characters are.) and travels worlds in the multiverse. Empowered by a spark within them, they have the power to jump between planes, going about their own business with their own goals - whether they're good or evil. \n\nI'd love to spitball ideas together, and thus I don't have any set ideas from the get-go. Now, this does mean that there's plenty of things we'll have to come up with on the fly, such as worlds and so. I will certainly come up with plenty, but I expect you to as well, this being a two-way street.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI enjoy different type of scenes - everything from adventuring, to travelling, to fighting and intrigue and the like - romance too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI play by Discord exclusively. I enjoy playing with fast responses, meaning I am not interested in replies done slowly throughout the day - I like sitting down to roleplay, with fast responses, but that of course also means roleplay won't be done every day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a descriptive male roleplayer looking for female characters, thus your IRL gender is of no matter to me, to create fun, entertaining stories with. 1-2 paragraphs per post is what I do, same range is expected from you. I require you to be 18+, since this will also include NSFW themes, which you must be fine with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to create stories together, same with plots. Lets make something together we'll both enjoy and have a lot of fun with. I prefer spit balling ideas, I do have some myself and feel free to bring some to the table too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also wouldn't mind doing something a little less grand scale, with say, Game of Thrones, or a more modern take on the idea with Marvel Cinematic Universe, so those are options too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf any interest, send me a PM with a Discord to add.",

I've been out of the game for several years and have been wanting to get back into roleplaying in recent months. I've posted a few times since discovering this forum but have yet to actually begin a roleplay so I'm hoping this is finally the time I can find a dependable partner. \n\nSome important notes:\n-I'm a full-time graduate student so my availability will likely be in the evenings (CST) and weekends. I can't guarantee to post every day but I will try to match my partner's post frequency\n-I won't type just 1-2 sentence responses, but I also can't guarantee lengthy paragraphs. I'll probably write around a paragraph or so for each response\n-I'm fine with NSFW and would like a romance somewhere in the roleplay but this by no means has to be the only/main plot \n-Ideally, I'm not only looking for a RP partner but also a friend to converse with on the side too!\n\nAll that being said, I don't have any current ideas but for now, I'd like to do some sort of slice of life RP. Something easy to get back into this but of course I'd want the story to have some complexity to be interesting. Please message me if this would interest you!",

            "selftext": " \n\nHi everyone,  \n\n\nMy name is Lukas and like the headline says, I'm searching for someone to roleplay with! About me: Well I'm just another nerd with some unpopular opinions, I guess. Basically, I am a toast. Multilingual, english is not my first language so please have some mercy. Sometimes I'm a little awkward too. Cosplayer. 20+ with about 10 years roleplay experience in my pockets. I would prefer to roleplay on Discord.  \nI prefer to play canon characters but I don\u2019t mind playing with OCs and/or casual rp. There aren\u2019t that many but, I'm always open to talk about everything, If you got any ideas, shoot! No matter if AU or Crossover. There are usually tons of AU ideas in my head, waiting to be done lmao.  \nThat being said, I do not look for a \"fling kinda thing\". I might not always be available for rp, since my muses can be moody from time to time, but I like to explore and  once I get attached to an rp  I am passionate about it. We can have like, ten different AU\u2019s or rp\u2019s going and I won\u2019t mind switching from one to another whenever we please. I'd be very happy to enjoy regular posting! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat else is there to know?  \n\n\nI absolutely love plotting and world-building, talk about whatever comes to mind. All the things even if its just random stuff that we won't use in the end. I just like talking about it. The only thing I don't like is, if the only purpose of the story is to have the characters end up in bed with each other, that certainly can be part of a story (or even the start of it, depending on the situation) but it shouldn't be the only thing.   \n\n\nI'm a little picky with shipping my characters. For me it's always something that's based on chemistry. I don\u2019t mind slow burn and I'm rather open about everything but if I don't feel it, I can't force it. It's not my decision. My muse will decide if they want it or not. Romance is not everything after all.\n\nThat being said. I don't mind writing paragraphs, depending on the situation, of course and I enjoy reading about the other persons characters feelings just as much! I also enjoy all kinds of drama and randomness while roleplaying,  but it's not necessary. Simple fluff and casual things can be nice too so never feel like you have to entertain me or something. Sometimes fate and coincidence are the best storytellers!\n\nIf we do anything angsty or sad please be aware that I usually need a happy ending. While its okay if I\u2019m bailing my eyes out,  do not do killing and don\u2019t like infinite suffering. I prefer a good balance.  \n\n\nA lot of my characters are introverts and very rude/bratty at first, so please keep in mind if they are lowky asshole-ish, thats never something personal, of course. \n\nHere is a list of the Fandoms I rp in and the characters I can do:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTony Stark (Marvel - Bi)  \nLoki (Marvel - Gay)\n\nTsukishima Kei (Haikyuu - Gay)  \nKimizuki Shiho (Owari no Seraph - Gay)  \nVirus (Dramatical Murder - Bi)  \nKeith Kogane (Voltron Legendary Defender - Gay)  \nNicholas Brown (Gangsta - Bi)\n\nKatarina Du Couteau (League of Legends - Straight)  \nVladimir (League of Legends - Bi)  \nSpyro (Spyro the Dragon)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do have a couple of OCs too but I'm not gonna list them.  \nI might add some more muses to the list sooner or later!",

Centuries ago, a war raged among the gods--instigated by Discord. When the other deities discovered his role in the chaos, they punished him by turning him into a beast, limiting his powers, and exiling him to an eternity of life in the mortal realm. For years he has wandered alone causing mischief where he can but mostly keeping to himself, all the while tending to his growing desire for revenge.\n\nYour character could be another deity with a desire to alter Discord's violent heart, or perhaps a mortal who wants to aline themselves with him for their own selfish ends.

            "selftext": "Hi! So, basically, what I\u2019m looking for is a story involving aliens or other nonhuman characters.  When I say nonhuman, I don\u2019t mean sticking pointy ears on a human body and calling it a new species, nor do I mean furry characters.  I mean something that could have evolved on another planet.  I\u2019m not saying you have to play an alien - you can play whatever you want! - just that the option exists for me.  Or, I would love to play a human against your alien character.  \n\nI\u2019m looking for any kind of setting that\u2019s not contemporary Earth.  In particular, I like non-military science fiction, low tech, low fantasy, historical, and unique non-Earth settings. \n\n**Writing Style:** Third person, past-tense.  I usually write a few paragraphs per post.  If I\u2019m setting up a scene or a backstory my posts can be several pages long.  During scenes with fast-paced dialogue my posts might only be a few lines.  Really it depends on what\u2019s going on in the story, and I\u2019m not one for length quotas. \n\n**Frequency:** I can usually post multiple times a day, and I\u2019m looking for someone who likes to post daily, although even more than that would be great.  I\u2019m available from 12pm-4pm EST, and sometimes after 10pm.\n\n**Themes I enjoy:** historical realism, blood &amp; violence, realistic melee combat, complex moral issues, drama, realistic characterization, low tech settings, fantasy/sci-fi mashups, horror, enemies becoming friends\n\n**Pairings:** For me, plot &gt; romance. I do enjoy romance very much if it develops organically and doesn\u2019t feel forced, but I can live without it. I won\u2019t do slice of life romance. \n\n\n[Click here for more detailed information on what I'm looking for, story ideas, and writing samples.]( https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VnHukEI3gWiF5pCMdqBWel4L50dvWkA5o7jVAcTwMvU/edit#)",

I'd also like to focus on his younger years, before and possibly during his prime. Would love to have a lot of angst, if you're into that, too. \n\nI use past tense, 3rd person, details, Discord only and I can reply at the very least once a day. I know life's more important, but if you are going to be gone for a lengthy period of time, I'd like to know. I'd also like to know if the roleplay isn't to your liking. Don't just ghost people, that's rude.\n\nAnyway! You can play as any canon character (that was alive back then) and you could possibly play as the GM or you can play as an OC and them and Yagi can develop a bond or friendship. (No NSFW though)\n\nWhat I also ask of you is that you're under 30 years of age, as I myself am a minor. If you're not comfortable with that, then this ad's not for you.\n\nThis is about it. For the plot, you can shoot me a message and we can discuss it more. Thanks for reading my ad! Have a plus ultra day!",

            "selftext": "Hello, fellow writers!  \n\nThank you for taking the time to read my roleplay post.  Let me start off by introducing myself \u2014 I\u2019m a man who (like many of you) is seeking to find a roleplay partner.  I've been somewhat busy due to grad school, but as of late, it has been truly refreshing to connect with so many other like-minded people in this community of writers.  Given that I\u2019m expecting to have a bit more time on my hands in the upcoming weeks, I figured I\u2019d reach out again, and hopefully find a few more mature, talented writers.\n\n**Preferred Genres:**\n\nMy writing tends to span a wide variety of genres\u2014including science fiction, historical fiction, and realistic modern fiction.  My writing has spanned both a personal as well professional nature, and as a result, I\u2019m always up for experimenting with new genres and writing styles.  Recently, I\u2019ve been dabbling a bit more in fantasy themes; however, I\u2019m still a novice when it comes to taking on high-fantasy themes.\n\n**Writing Style:**\n\nI will humbly admit that I tend to be a voracious writer, and as a result, my posts frequently range in the 3-4+ paragraph range.  Granted, there are certain occasions when a shorter length is more desirable (especially in conversational, or dialogue-intensive scenes)\u2014and this is certainly something I implement when necessary.  I\u2019m a strong believer in quality over quantity, and I\u2019m hoping to find a fellow writer who has an appreciation for packing a large quantity of details in a condensed post (within reason).\n\n**Collaboration:**\n\nFor me, the pre-writing, collaborative stage is as enjoyable as the writing process itself.  I know that some writers prefer to jump head-first into writing the story itself\u2014with minimal discussion.  Based on experience, this approach is due to the fact that some writers fear that too much discussion may \u201creveal\u201d too much of the plot prior to writing.  While this is certainly a valid point, it is important for me to mention that my discussions do not pertain to plot;  rather, they pertain to exploring the characters\u2019 backstories, emotional orientations, cultural groundings, and other such factors.  It\u2019s more with regard to developing a creative discourse with my writing partner to truly immerse\u2014and \u201clive\u201d\u2014the experiences of our characters.  To me, it is this level of exploration and collaboration that truly make roleplaying a much more engaging process as compared to solo writing.\n\n**Writing Platforms:**\n\nI prefer to write my stories via email; however, I strongly prefer to collaborate with my co-writers via a text IM platform such as Skype, Google Hangouts, or Discord.  This is largely because an IM platform allows for a truly conversational, back-and-forth discourse about the story (rather than a static series of isolated messages via email).  I also find that my best stories tend to emerge with individuals with whom I am able to cultivate a strong intellectual chemistry with\u2014and as a result, this has led to several long-term stories.  I would be absolutely thrilled to find other writers in this subreddit who are also looking for long-term stories.  \n\n**Hard Requirements in a Writing Partner:**\n\n* **Be over 18 [ideally over 21].**  This is not to suggest that my stories always involve adult themes.  In fact, many of my stories do not involve NSFW themes at all.  However, I feel exponentially more comfortable discussing literary ideas with fellow adults.  As a result, I set this as a strict limit, and I have a zero tolerance policy for those who lie about their age.  As a result, I will be firm for only this particular issue\u2014 *do not contact me unless you are 18 years of age.*\n\n* **Interested in conversation and collaboration.**  As I mentioned above, I\u2019m seeking a writer who is truly interested in forming a long-term collaborative writing partnership.  This means not only focusing on issues pertaining to our story at hand, but also to broader issues concerning our writing as a whole.  Ideally, it would be nice to connect with other working professionals who are looking to use writing as a creative outlet, of sorts.\n\n* **Mutual respect.**  As I\u2019m sure is the case with many of you, I simply cannot be in front of the computer 24/7 due to real life responsibilities and obligations.  Because of this, I hope to find a writer who is committed, yet flexible\u2014someone who is willing to maintain open communication while at the same time, respecting one another\u2019s autonomy.\n\nIf this post has captured your interest or imagination, then by all means, I would love to hear from you!  In your post, please tell me a bit about yourself, and your background in writing.  Hopefully we can get a conversation going, and weave our way into writing a story together.\n\nThanks for your time; I hope to hear from you!",

            "selftext": "So, after a long hiatus I've gotten back into World of Warcraft, and I'm dying to do some RPing based around it. Some notes about what I'm looking for:\n\n\\- My #1 priority is finding a **Jaina Proudmoore** RP'er that's comfortable with writing female on female romance; I have a character that needs some lady loving and Jaina would be perfect for that. If you're interested in opposing themes and factions falling for each other, this is for you!  \n\\- **I'll write smut** and the like, it really doesn't matter too terribly much to me.  \n\\- I'm also interested in other character interactions within the WoW universe, so if you've got ideas then I'm all down to write them! Maybe we create some Night Elf siblings that are learning how to cope with the loss of their home and family? A couple of Zandalari Troll best friends fighting together during the raid on their city? Honestly, there are so many different options here, and I'm interested in them all!  \n\n\nAnd, of course, notes on the delivery of the RP I'd prefer:  \n\n\n\\- **Through Discord**. I'll probably make a server with nice, organized channels just for this endeavor.  \n\\- **Paragraph responses**. I'll probably write anywhere from two to six paragraphs depending on a variety of factors, but don't feel the need to always match me! As long as you're giving me substance, I don't mind if you respond to six paragraphs with just one.  \n\\- **Decent spelling and grammar.** I want to be able to understand what you're giving me.  \n\\- **Willingness to interact and chat outside of the RP!** I want to talk plots with you. Give me character arc discussion, plot ideas, gushing over each other's characters! Basically, prepare to become friends because that's just kind of who I am!  \n\n\nOh. Also, I'm a 25-year-old female that has a lot of time on her hands, but never a lot of actual inspiration to write. I'm also a huge nerd and let video games get in the way of other, more important things at times. Still, I'm friendly, open, and always down to chat! DM me if you're interested and tell me a little about yourself! &lt;3",

But the idea of the story intrigued me and so i would like to try out my luck here!\n\nThe year would be 1943, the outskirts of German occupied Paris. American and British Bombers fly over on their way towards Germany,constantly harassed by fighters. On the ground civilians go about their day, as the fight in the sky up ahead ends, people relax a bit more. \n\nYour charchter could be whoever you want, a French resistance fighter? A civilian or a combat nurse? Whatever you feel would fit you the best. As the main focus of the roleplay will be the interaction between our charchters and the romance that will follow, it's up to you. I would play a German Officer coming back from the eastern front. Devastated by the destruction seen and thus sent to France for a bit more calm tasks. \n\nAnother is where the officer tries to feed intelligence of the atrocities to the allies through your charchter. Torn between his heart and what he knows to be right. This right now is my favourite as it usually ends up far more intresting. \n\n\n\nI hope you like the idea, for this roleplay I would like someone who's detailed and can help push a story forward without having me drag the entire story :) \nI hope to hear from you! \n\nI am available on kik and on Discord!",

After disposing of Courier 6 in Goodsprings, the chairman Benny attempted to overthrow the de facto ruler of the New Vegas Strip Robert House. Upon reaching the Fort, Benny was crucified by Caesar's Legion, and the platinum chip was used to destroy House's securitron army. This left only the Legion and NCR to fight for Hoover Dam.\nThe NCR were pushed back from the dam, and fell to the Nevada/New California border. There the Bull and Bear locked arms in direct, open conflict. On NCR soil, crimson stained the land. The Legion was defeated, and retreated to four corners. Edward Sallow passes due to an unknown illness, brain cancer. Legate Lanius dies during the battle of the long 15, shot through the chest by an NCR sniper named Craig Boone. With the Legion out of the Mojave, the NCR swept in to capture New Vegas and wrest control from House. The Mojave becomes an NCR territory.\nThe year is 2295, the New California Republic seeks to expand their reach north into the Pacific northwest. A new, dangerous frontier to explore. Untouched pre-war ruins, secluded tribes, deadly mutants. The final frontier in the West. Welcome to Cascade, keep your big iron strapped and your spurs jingle jangling.\n\nFallout: The Frontier is a text-based discord RP campaign using a custom bot called CORE for rolling and stats. Just DM me for an invite to the server, and the admin there will set you up. There are a number of other campaigns in and outside of the fallout universe here as well, so there's sure to be something if the Frontier isn't what you thought!\nLogo by u/TheBusStop12",

We are first and foremost a mature community of 18+ literate roleplayers looking to add more quality writers to this world! We write anywhere from novella to a minimum of paragraph length, offer clean organised OOC chats, and a team of dedicated and responsive staff.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven though our lore is fairly extensive, it is split in a way to ease access for new characters in must-read and optional sections. We welcome original characters who are looking for a natural progression through Lush be it through learning magic, acquiring magical items or accessing high society in a moderated way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the pitch : \"Lush, a magocracy established in the eye of what the council named 'The mist'. A complex, self-sufficient chain of guild-ruled mega districts. It floats amongst a dense fog, held by magically powered devices lining the city's edges. Since it is made of an agglomeration of different districts connected by large magical bridges, there isn't a direct way in, or out of it. Anyone that comes or leaves must be either summoned, or banished by a mage. The arcane arts play a major role in the life of nearly all of its inhabitants, and while tech in itself was never really let aside.. most innovations combine a certain amount of engineering, and spellcrafting. As a result, Lush is stuck in an era of its own, replacing most of today's convenience with magical means, yet dropping any significant tech past the medieval era in the process \\[...\\]\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you are interested, here's the invite link: [https://discord.gg/hQVRyZd](https://discord.gg/hQVRyZd)",

Im currently looking to so a long term superhero/vigilante roleplay the story will center around your character being recruited to join a team of heroes of various ages and backgrounds, and slowly becoming the greatest heroes the world has ever seen.\n\nIve done many roleplays in the past, hut this is one I'm particularly excited for, as i love superheroes/mythology. I love building a universe and building lore for for it, and i especially love stories about people rising up to do good in a world where people tell them that they cant.\n\nSo what can you expect from this roleplay? Action, drama, romance, and much more. As the GM I will he playing multiple characters, all of whom will be unique and interesting, and I'm not just talking about powers. Ill be taking lots of inspiration from other comics, and I will do my best to keep you hooked. \n\nThe stories will be divided into chapters, each chapter will focus on character development; characters will die, and others will be introduced, and the villains will test the heroes in ways you cant even imagine.\n\nIm purposefully being a little vague here... for more details, dm me! I can roleplay on discord or kik, and i look forward to hearing from you soon! If you text me please describe your characters powers and a short description of them fighting crime or saving someone.",

I've been having a really hard time with being ghosted lately and was hoping to find new people who were maybe a bit more dedicated. \n\nI have a charater in mind who is 17 and in high school! I haven't written high schools students in a while so it might be a little rough. Anyway, the character is a sadistic mess of a girl with rich parents who pay their way out of her problems. Of you've ever seen or read the anime/manga Skip Beat, she's based off of one of the characters from there, but it doesn't matter if you haven't, since she isn't the character exactly. \n\nWhat I'm looking for: \n\n* For this rp only, since it's a high school setting, I'll accept 16+. There won't be any sexual scenes. There might be allusions to others, but not for our characters. Not even fade-to-black. \n* I am willing to do fxf, fxm, or fxnb. It doesn't matter to me what your irl gender is, you can do whatever!\n* Casual length. I usually do a paragraph or less, excluding introductions and beginnings. I don't mind if my partner writes more, but I feel no need to match length if I can get my point across more concisely. My partner shouldn't feel obligated either. \n* A decent writer. If I notice in the first few exchanges that you aren't a consistent writer or that you write like a 14 y/o who just discovered fanfiction, I'm not gonna continue. \n* I write in 3rd person/past tense and I'm not really willing to change that. I could maybe write in present tense if my partner is insistent but the 3rd person isn't going to change ever. \n* I want these to be romance stories, mostly, but if we end up with our characters not matching, I would rather not force it. This will be a modern setting\n\nIf you're interested, PM me!",

Now, as I've found myself in the Persona and roleplaying mood, I figure the plot I outlined would make for a great jumping off point for a Persona rp. Obviously, both the plot and the characters would be original creations that we can both workshop and add to as we set it up. But just in case, I have a slew of plot points and characters we can use.\n\nAs this story would be set up like a Persona game, there's room for all sorts of genres. Mystery, romance, slice of life, action, etc., so we have a lot of wiggle room to shake things up every now and then. I'm not super stickler on length or format but I do personally prefer 3rd person and a length I can work with when it comes to replies.\n\nI'm being a little vague here but I promise you, I have everything in mind from theme to confidants! We can hammer out the details when we get to talking. I would love to share my ideas with you and see if we connect as roleplay partners!

            "selftext": "The Fantasy Sandbox is a collaborative, medieval-fantasy story writing and world-building game in which all players have an equal input to the story and its effectively crowdsourced setting. This creates a unique, community-designed but cohesive roleplaying world and experience that allows a vast number of different fantasy themes in one place. You can play as any character or race--a king, a knight, an adventurer, a petty criminal, a mastermind villain, a commoner, a wizard or mage, a dragon, a fairy, you name it, provided they are presented in a medieval fantasy theme. Every character has a unique role and contribution to the game. In this freeform roleplaying setup, players create all the civilizations, stories, characters, and world geography within a casual rule set that maintains balance. As a result, interwoven stories emerge. The game world depends on that very emergence and has been developing its identity from a completely blank slate over the course of two years.\n\nThere's no telling who of the many currently active characters you'll meet or where you'll go. Player-designed factions have formed kingdoms, player-written quests drive entire adventures, and politics shape the land.\n\nThis has always been an open community game. If you like to roleplay in medieval-fantasy themes, we invite you to join us in helping maintain our novel continuum alive with new characters, plots, and settings!\n\n[***http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/5/introduction***](http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/5/introduction)  \n[***https://discord.gg/cb5n63C***](https://discord.gg/cb5n63C)",

As we approach the body to investigate it vanishes in a black mist.\n\nConfused and dumbfounded we go to report the deed, only to find the deceased party alive and well, leading to further confusion.\n\nSo this first plot is a nice little conspiracy, shapeshifters are invading and taking over positions of power, this will lead to us trying to uncover and the plot before the shapeshifters take over.\n\nMany years ago the world was ruled by the demon king Satanael along with his seven deadly sins and demon armies. The only thing that managed to stop his iron tight grasp was the combined forces of ten great wizards who managed to seal away the demon king and his underlings, however this came at a great price for the wizards, they each sacrificed their bodies becoming keys for the seal which holds the demons.\n\nWe now jump forward in time, worshippers of the demon king have began to gather the 10 keys, having four within the grasp, they plan to release Satanael and have him rule once again.\n\nNow in this prompt we would ether play as the king\u2019s elite squad, sent out only on the most dangerous of missions or a group of adventurers coming across the plot and feeling a need to stop the resurrection of the demon king.\n\nThe third and final prompt involves us playing as already existing adventures who have suffered their most devastating defeat, this leads to us being sold off to some foreign island where we work as prisoners trying to find some way to escape the island and captivity.\n\nSo those are my prompts.\n\nNow what do I expect from you? Well not too much actually, all I ask is you be enthusiastic and for your post length, just give me something to work with, that\u2019s all. \n\nI enjoy using 3rd person however I am always fine with playing in the 1st.\n\nI\u2019ll mention once again I\u2019m not married to these ideas. I hope at least one of them has tickled your fancy, so please just send me a message, I\u2019m friendly and don\u2019t bite :)",

            "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n*A group roleplay server on discord hoping to grow!*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA dark time for dragons and humans alike rose when strange activities began appearing among the dark markets. Dragon teeth, scales, eggs, all acquired and sold no matter how difficult the task was to find them. All the elements of dragons began to fall, decrease in numbers. And so it came to be that Wistwood Academy, a large boarding school based near a small, cosmic town, set up an unused part of the grounds to accommodate for the dragons\u2019 residence. As rare a species as they may be now, many of what was left have moved to live in the area, taking up safety in the hidden region that stretches between Wistwood Academy and the town beside it, the only civilisations for thousands of miles. The Academy in itself had only been around for a century before the dragons moved near. Nobody knows exactly how the school got its start, but what is known is that it started unlike any other, a school for rich parents to send their kids to, ever hopeful they will succeed excessively. The school gives out scholarships rather steadily, convinced that those not wealthy enough to enroll still have qualities and skills to share. It\u2019s wide range of electives shuffled to include dragon studies, a popular choice among new students. Students and dragons coexisted in Wistwood until something rather puzzling, rather mystical happened. A student and dragon came to choose each other, offering protection and a solid understanding between them that has yet to be explained. Since this, dozens upon dozens of students and dragons have bonded, an unbreakable pact that allows them to communicate and exist not beside each other, but with each other. Will you be lucky enough to find your unanimous companion?

            "selftext": "Hey! So im simply looking for a partner again. Who can rp on discord and who is available at night mostly. I'm in the U.S. and don't have a lot of free time during the day.\n\nLet's jump into the plots!\n\nSo my first one is a vampire and human, moderny one. I don't care how rough you are but I'd like it to be a romance-ish. Smut is fine. But here's my delema, I'm always the vampire and for once I wanna be the human. \n\nMy second one is more mapped out and I do have two separate face claims for my two separate ideas.\n\nCowgirl girl and a city boy (orvice versa) are dared to date for a month in a game of truth or dare at a party. But they hate each other. The things they have to do: 1st week, Go on a first date and post a picture of them together to show how official they are. \n2nd week, learn how to be city and country together. \n3rd, move in\n4th, meet each other's parents. \n\nI have two starters for both roles.\n\nGabriella was a country gal, she grew up in horse shoes, you father was a drunk and her mom was dying of lukiema. But her family kept it hush hush so no one knew what she felt with. She was 19, going to a party she was invited to. She was short and had a body like a back road. Her brown hair was curled and she showed up in a pair of shorts and a black sheer shirt with a black tank top underneath. She knew there weren't gonna be too many people there, she shut the door to her pick up truck. She walked inside the house and was greeted by her city friends. There was about nine people there, mainly guys, but they were a mix of country and city so they thought highly of her. With her being one of two girls there, she knew truth or dare wouldn't be fair at all. \"Hey y'all! I've missed you guys!\" She hugged everyone and smiled as her brown hair bounced will every movement.\n\nOR\n\nGabriella was spoiled rotten by her father, she was a brat and no one like her. But no one knew it was a facade. She walked into the party, smiling and socializing with the best of the best. Everyone was trying to get in bed with her, she was rejecting people faster than you could blink, she was rude about it too. But everyone decided to play truth or dare, so out she went. She sat by the pool and drank white wine. She was wearing way too much make up, fake tan, and a hot pink tight Dress. Her blonde hair was a wig, but she had it all done to make it look all real. She made herself into someone she wasn't with money. But little did she know a country boy would change all that.",

Looking for stories to tell!\n\nI'm looking for something futuristic, researchers in a space colony trying to carve out humanity's future among the stars (this one definitely has room to get dark, vaguely based on the SAYER universe though we might have less murderous AIs).\n\n\nOther plot starters ideas I'm looking to play include:\n\n1. A medieval fantasy story that's more political than magical, because political dramas are my favorite. Evil queen looking for the fountain of youth, or a rogue warrior trying to regain her honor? Yes please.\n\n2. A modern fantasy story in which \"mythological\" creatures actually exist, but try to keep their existence hidden from the average person.\n\n3. Men in Black and UFOs. I love the scary MiB\n\n\nAs stated above,  I'm back to my fandom cravings, including but not limited to the Dragon Age and Mass Effect. I love canon characters, OCs, the works, just let me know! \n\n\nI use Discord now because it's  awesome and I  like being able to have  separate threads for different  conversations. I  am a character-making  fool, so if you like to have  four or five  characters, let me know! \n\nMy posts range  from two paragraphs to two pages depending on what feels   right, but if  you give me a lot, I'll do my best to match your pacing.  I also really  like multiple posts a day, whenever possible, and tend  to try to reply  as quickly as I can to keep things moving.\n\nWe can discuss limits and all that when we're chatting.

Medieval and modern fantasy are my main fields of interest - within that we can get as creative as we want.

Hunter/Assasin for the Imperial Empire? A survivor of one of the raided villages?\n\nIts up to you.\n\nIf your interested in giving this RP, feel free to DM me.\n\nI RP mainly on discord, but i also use Kik and Reddit.",

            "selftext": "Hello all! I've decided to go on a hunt for some roleplay partners. First, a bit about myself. \n\nI am a 20 year old girl who loves to create characters of all kinds and act out roleplays that are funny, romantic, and worth the time invested. While I do have my moments of business or tiredness, I am pretty free most the time. I roleplay in 3rd Person and my personal favorite genres are slice of life and/or modern fantasy mixed with romance. I'm not too picky on length but my comfort zone is 2-15+ lines depending on my level of creativity and how much the other person puts out. I do prefer LGBT roleplays although I can do straight roleplays. I prefer our characters to be able to change out on the who wears the pants role or for me to be the lesser pants wearer. Most of my characters are less masculine  or ambiguous. \nNow onto preferences for my partner. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMUSTS: \n\nMust be willing and able to have or create a decently fleshed out character. I have a character template that I use for my ocs if you need one. Character tropes are fine, although I take some issue with some but as long as they go beyond that trope and are their own person beyond 1 or 2 character traits, they're fine!\n\nMust have decent grammar and spelling. Now I know nobody's grammar or spelling is perfect, but I need to be able to understand what you're typing. \n\nMust reply at least every other day. I understand being busy and having times where you can't reply for a few days but id like to be notified if and when those things happen. I usually wait 4-7 days for someone to reply and will send the occasional 'hi' or 'hey' as a reminder. (Note: I also encourage you to be annoying to get me to reply. Sometimes I get distracted to the point of forgetting to reply or Discord won't send my reply or won't notify me when you reply. Send me reminders. If I ghost you it's never on purpose.) \n\nMUST NOT GHOST. I get being busy or even not wanting to roleplay with me. LET ME KNOW. So many people tend to ghost  when They get busy or dont want to tell me that they're not feeling me or the roleplay. Tell me. That way I know and can have a little closure. \n\nHave Discord.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEXTRA POINTS IF (you do not have to share these but it helps if you do)\n\nYou roleplay LGBT\n\nYou like multiple RPs, multiple characters to be going on at once (I LOVE polyamory)\n\nYou like talking and developing the RP as its happening\n\nYou are okay with rping as/with ocs who are mentally ill or physically disabled in some way. \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSend me a message telling me about you, what you like/don't like in a roleplay, and if you hit any of the extra points! I look forward to role-playing with you!! Please send the keyphrase \"Don't ask Don't Pas-tell\" somewhere in your message so I know you read through everything!",

            "selftext": "Hi there!\n\nMy name is Alex, and I am in the mood for some roleplay! I have quite a few ideas so I'll shorten them and let you all pick whichever you wish.\n\nFirst things first though: I love romance, so that's a must. NSFW stuff is fine I guess, it's optional we'll say. I do like some good drama and action, and with action comes blood and gore, and swearing. I'm looking for someone over the age of 18, because of this.\n\nI want someone who can manage a paragraph or two per message.\n\nI'll list the prompts from most favorite to least. Anyone who messages saying they'll do the ones I have as my most favorites will definitely get priority. I'll also list possible pairings. I'm fine with MxF, and FxF, even FxFuta. Not MxM tho, don't ask about that.\n\n1. Legend of Zelda (Breath of the Wild) I want to do a roleplay set after the events of Breath of the Wild. It's be Link and Zelda, with me as Link preferably. Everytime I do a Zelda rp I get ghosted, it sucks. Please don't do that. (MxF)\n\n2. Halo. I would love to do a Halo roleplay. We would preferably be ODST or Marines before or right at the start of the Covenant War. (MxF, FxF, FuxF)\n\n3. Star Wars. This would be open ended, we would discuss this in kik, or you could start your message with ideas for this one :D (MxF, FxF, FuxF)\n\n4. Worldbuilding. This will be fantasy, and open ended just like the Star Wars prompt. I honestly don't have any male fantasy characters, so I'll be playing female, but you can play male of course. (MxF, FxF, FuxF)\n\nSo that's it! Not as many prompts as I originally thought... But hey, it is what it is. Better to be short sweet and to the point I suppose.\n\nSo message me! Let me know if you have ideas or suggestions for any of these plots so long as you don't like, change the idea entirely or something.\n\nThat's all! Hopefully we can rp \ud83d\udc4d",

            "selftext": "Hey guys, I'm looking for a partner to play any character from DC, Marvel, Image, Valiant, IDW, or Dark Horse. I don't really have a specific plot in mind, so I'm open to doing any combo of characters. \n\nI am capable of roleplaying the following characters: Invincible, Tempest, Red Robin, Timothy Hunter, Robin, Ninjak, Hawk, Marko, Spider-Man, Daredevil, Hal Jordan, Green Arrow, Wally West, Shazam, Batman Beyond, Red Hood, Casey Jones, Superman, Cyborg,  Black Adam, Hellboy, John Constantine, Jason Blood/Etrigan, Swamp Thing, Nightcrawler, Nightwing, Raphael, Donatello, Michelangelo, Yorick Brown, Leonardo, Superboy, Bane, Deathstroke, Sinestro, Lex Luthor, Black Manta, Dream of the Endless, Captain Cold, Deadshot, Atom, Mister Miracle, Kyle Rayner, Beast Boy, Ted Kord, Zachary Zatara, and Jaime Reyes. I'm always willing to try roleplaying new characters though, so if you want me to roleplay someone not on my list, I'm willing to give it a shot. \n\nMoving on to the boring rules part of the post, I'd like for my partners to be detailed. I average about 500 words per reply, and would like for a partner that could respond within a similar range.  I also ask that my partner be fine with mature themes, as I like being able to portray the character without many restrictions. Some of the characters I roleplay as can be violent, have drug issues, curse a lot, etc. I'm also not really interested in roleplaying with any OCs, sorry.\n\nThat pretty much sums up everything that I wanted to say. If this post interested you at all, please send me a message. I look forward to exploring some comic book worlds!",

Night followed close behind, consuming the thicket and brought with it unseen dangers that lurked just behind the tree line and made ungodly noises to make their presence known.\n\nA small woman paced back and forth on the porch of her little ramshackle home as she waited for her husband to return to her. Night always worried her ever since she was a child. Her father had told her stories of a monster that would come and get her if she ever stayed out after dark, she knew the story wasn\u2019t true but she couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that there maybe something out there\u2026 lurking\u2026 waiting\u2026 \n\nNell went back inside to ease herself by the fire. She waddled into the two room home only to slump down in a chair next to the fireplace. The flames danced higher against the stone walls of the fireplace and transfixed Nells attention but soon after she was snapped back to reality by an odd noise came from outside. The loud squacks of the chickens alerted her to something wrong, then one of the loud cries stopped and within a few minutes the panic has stopped. Nell felt her heart leap out of her chest and she instinctively put her hands over her growing belly to protect the child inside. \n\nNells anxieties were calmed when she heard the distant noise of her husbands hounds barking happily. She stood and shuffled to the door, opening it with a laboured grunt. She stared down at the porch. There lay the bloody foot of a chicken along with a few other bits and feathers. \n\n\\---------\n\nHallo!\n\nI hope I pulled you in sufficiently with that starter.\n\nSo! This is a pioneer horror story with monsters and such, we can always discuss what the monsters are if you have your own ideas. \n\nI just ask that you reply to my starter so i can get a feel of your writing style and character!\n\nTLDR: It\u2019s 1845 and there\u2019s monsters.

            "selftext": "CURRENT SEARCH \n\nSo I guess I\u2019m now in the market for a psychological/modern roleplay revolving around fame, identity, professional success and personal failure, selfishness, and the struggle for authenticity and self-love across the spectrum of a career. \n\nWow, that was a mouthful. So essentially: the life of musicians, actors, celebrities, and the people that intersect their lives. Our characters don\u2019t necessarily both have to be celebrities, but their lives likely involve fame in some facet, even if it\u2019s coming from the production or business side...or something else. \u00a0\n\nExample scenarios (but not limited to)\n\nA sophisticated and ruthless music manager who plays a key role in transforming a musician/actor into a man worthy of the world stage--and also has a starring role in the hurricane of his personal life *** most interested in\n\nA music sensation whose success is shadowed by self loathing and a fragile personal life **** can be paired with the above bullet\n\nTwo musicians/actors/etc vacillate between longing, jealousy, and lifting each other up through the darkest parts of their careers\n\nA producer or veteran to the world of fame who finds himself taking an industry upstart under his wing to steer him away from making the same mistakes he did\n\n\nI\u2019d like to explore two forces of nature and their relationship over the years -- how it ebbs and flows with their needs and priorities and how they are changed not only by their own personal desires but the external factors of life, their careers, and the people around them. I\u2019m looking for characters who are more or less on equal terms -- who are both good and selfish and are equally responsible for whatever is or comes between them. We can start at the beginning or we can start at the middle or go out of chronological order. \n\nABOUT ME\n\nI'm looking for 21+ writers to collaborate. I\u2019m a detailed writer. I\u2019m not so fussed with length; effort, detail, a sense of prose, and having something to work off of are my main concerns. Pretty much, these are things I try to accomplish in my own writing. I primarily write over Gdocs and private Discord server; feel free to reach out through DM. When you contact me, please be specific about characters you want to play and ideas you have. I\u2019d also be willing to swap writing samples before we start so we can get a sense of if our styles will mesh. \n\nI\u2019m really only looking at m// for this but feel free to pitch me an idea otherwise. Also, I usually prefer to focus on one character at first but am adept at writing multiple characters especially in the long run.",

To make this post short and sweet, I'll just make a list of things which should make it easier for people to see what I like.\n\nGenres I like: Medieval, Post Apoc, Dark, Gritty, Horror, Low Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Superheroes, Grim-Dark (pretty much every NSFW tag), Greek, Roman, some Fandoms (Fallout, Elder Scrolls, Warframe, Game Of Thrones, Star Wars, and Alien Vs Predator are some which quickly come to mind, admittedly, there is a lot which I like, but these are the main few).\n\nWhat I hope (though am not limited to) to do RP wise however, is play a character in someone's world, basically exploring about and doing stories whenever the character stumbles upon them or happens to fall into one. A GM/DM is who I am primarily looking for as a partner (BUT not required!). And hopefully one who has no limits, like me. And yes, I'm fine with playing female characters too.\n\nIn terms of RP, I have no limits, so any story can go with me or anything can happen in RP and i'm fine with it.\n\nSo if you're interested in a partner with no limits, i'm up for it!\n\nIf you want to ask anything, make sure of anything or anything of the like, feel free to message me or talk with me using the Reddit chat system.\n\nThough please, don't just remove me while we're setting things up or whatever else. If you have the urge, please tell me why so we can work on it or so that I'd at least be aware. :)\n\nThanks for reading!",

I'm mainly oriented towards realistic settings, but can enjoy highly creative themes such as fantasy, sci-fi, dystopian.\n\nYou can find a couple of examples down below:\n\n1. **The jock:** a privileged young man, a senior student who managed to get to the end of his university career studying economics just because he's a jock and the college needs him to play in their football team. This \"white straight male\" privilege would permeate his entire life, even after his graduation, as his frat connections would land him a well paid job as manager. Due to his poor results, the jock is forced to get help from my character, a college tutor and fellow student, someone the frat guy would consider a nerd loser, and what's more, a gay loser, upon finding out about his orientation. Will they somehow grow closer? If so, how will the jock reconcile his unexpected feelings with the fact he has a girlfriend he plans on marrying?\n2. **The bluecollar**: the rugged man, still in his worksuit, is sitting at the counter of a gay bar, during a Friday evening. His wife recently divorced on him, leaving with the kids, yet he still wears his wedding ring. In spite of considering himself straight, he's always felt an attraction towards men he had to suppress, but now it's different. Spurred by the hardships of this unexpected turn in his life, the man decided to come here, and now awkwardly sits, drinking a beer. Imagine the surprise in my character's face when the burly stranger will offer him a drink, explaining he's not really used to picking up gays, asking if he's supposed to approah them like he would a woman.\n\n# A final note\n\nI can share my **Discord** or link us to a **Google Doc**, where we'll be able to have an instant messaging conversation and exchange creative ideas.\n\nI'm fluent in English, but it's worth mentioning that I'm Italian and I'd be glad to roleplay in my native language if an Italian user comes by.\n\nLooking forward to your messages :3\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[*I'm an adult/18+ in real life, I'm looking for a partner who is an adult/18+ in real life, everything discussed is fantasy.*\\]",

            "selftext": "Hey, all!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's just jump right into it! I have about ten years of experience writing, and I'm a very avid reader. I find myself deprived of some much needed time with RP-ing, so I hope this is where you come in!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBare with me, I am a bit rusty, so I don't have a whole lot of ideas regarding plots, but I do have plans on **what type of characters I'd like to play**:\n\nI enjoy female roles, ages 21-25 (I want to keep it near my IRL age for believability and real thoughts and feelings my character might have.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Regarding genre:** I prefer romance, fantasy, horror, action, and adventure. I find it most comfortable to roleplay in this current day and age. I will consider doing timepieces, depending on the plot and our ideas.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I consider myself literate** with excellent grammar, spelling, and word use. I typically write anywhere from 2-6 paragraphs depending on what the other person writes and what I have to go off of. I enjoy details and breathing life into my character by delving into his/her mind and expressing his/her thoughts, feelings, examinations, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I typically use OCs** and find it difficult to use canon characters. For me, it is much easier to create my own, complex character and not stick to a pre-designed script/biography. All that said, when I do create a character, I tend to leave the history out as I find it much more intriguing to develop that for each story I place that character in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I wish to write these stories through Discord,** though if you have another suggestion/preference, please let me know. I will let you know whether or not I'm comfortable with that idea.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**In terms of availability:** I work a few days a week, typically 25-30 hours. I find the time to post after work for a few hours most evenings after 8:30 PM EST. If there are days where I'm not going to be able to respond, I will let you know ASAP.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What I am NOT LOOKING FOR:**\n\n\\-Less than two paragraphs a post\n\n\\-Poor grammar/spelling\n\n\\-Canon rolls\n\n\\-A disappearing partner (just let me know that you'll get back to me when you find the time. I get it, life is crazy.)\n\n\\-OP characters\n\n\\-Gary/Mary Sue characters (charries with no personality)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What I AM LOOKING FOR:**\n\n\\-18+ for romantic roles\n\n\\-Grammar and spelling is a must!\n\n\\-QUALITY over quantity (if you can't match my lengthy paragraphs, that's fine! Make your response well thought out, exciting, and give me something to go off of, please.)\n\n\\-TWO-SIDED decision making (not sure where to go with the plot? Communicate! I might have some ideas. We might be able to cook something up together!)\n\n\\-Consistent, timely responses (as mentioned above, I get it when life steps in the way, just be considerate and shoot me a \"Bit busy, will get back to you ASAP\" message when you can. I promise to do the same.)\n\n\\-IDEAS! ... Help me, please... Dx\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell...wait...you still there? Gosh...Props to you! Thank you so much for taking the time to read through my lengthy post. If you're interested in collaborating with me, please send me a sample of your writing to my inbox and have ideas of what you might like to pursue with me ready. I appreciate you all for getting this far, and I sincerely hope I haven't scared you off. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\\[TL;DR\\]** Experienced, literate, female roleplayer looking for experienced, literate, male roleplayer interested in creating a story together.

I have four plots I can share via PM that alter some events for the sake of our story but we don't need to use them if they don't appeal to you. Once we're on the same page, we can then relocate to discord.\n\n- I can play Theon, Arya, Jon, Tyrion or Jorah. Maybe others, and other side pairs are also something we can discuss or add as we go. I'm pretty open.\n\n- I don't like canon x OC stuff usually but I might be convinced, it all depends on what OC you have. And then doubling would be required then, where you play a canon for my OC and I'd play a canon for yours. We would both plot and treat each pair fairly and equally. But at any rate, I do prefer canons above OCs. I do not put OCs with other OCs though. \n\n- I am looking for people who write in third person, past tense and give about 3 paragraphs on average. Details are important and I'm happy to wait a week or two for a good post. I don't want people rushing.\n\n- Mature content is expected to happen so you need to be 18 years or older. In the same vein, Sansa is aged up as well. Let me know if some topics are off-limits though. \n\n- Lastly, I don't really reply to chat messages on reddit because I find them a little unreliable so I'd prefer to be private messaged instead. \n\nThanks guys, despite its flaws, GoT has been quite wonderful television.",

It's been another month, the ghosts have turned transparent and floated off, and I'm looking for a partner to play in the Warhammer 40,000 setting!  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI'm looking for older players whose lives are more stable, who might reasonably be around for a while if we end up clicking.  I work from home, and I'm a fast typist, so I can usually offer fast responses.  If I'm going to be unavailable, I will communicate with you. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI'm looking for an advanced grasp of grammar and syntax.  I hope you are, too.  I'm looking for someone who will step up and add to the depth and breadth of the world with me, not just be along for the ride.  Please be at least slightly familiar with canon and willing to look things up where you aren't.  I know it's a complicated setting, and I'm not going to be super strict about the exact words of a prayer the Mechanicus uses or the precise procedure of running under obscurement, I just don't want to see any catgirl commissars or pink-haired Inquisitors.  If you want to be in charge of a faction, please be prepared to write your ship, headquarters, or subordinates.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI do want some kind of positive outcome for the characters even though the setting is dark, but it doesn't have to be romance if that's not your bag.  It could be friendship, or grudging respect, or just working together to achieve a common goal successfully.  We can discuss and negotiate on how dark things get in general, and what sort of plot and story we want to engage with.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI'm a 37-year-old female.  I don't care about your gender or orientation, only your writing skills.  Similarly, I don't mind what gender or orientation of character I play.  I'm here for the story.  **Please be willing to provide writing samples.**  I have lots to share and look forward to playing with you!",

Another thing -- I absolutely love OOC chatter and I try to communicate regularly even if we aren't writing back and forth.\n\nI only write using Discord!\n\nMy style of writing is third-person, past-tense paragraph(s). My quantity varies with the plot and the scene in the plot. Dialogue is generally shorter; however, I am not against writing three to four paragraphs if the moment in the plot calls for it. I will not write with anyone who uses first person.\n\nI will write any gender in any pairing. I am comfortable with writing NSFW themes but I ask that you are eighteen or older because I don't particularly like the idea of going to jail.\n\nMy plots will always include romance because I absolutely adore it and I will never tire of writing it. However, I am particularly fond of slowburn romance as frustrating as it can become! The genres I am searching for are post-apocalypse, dystopia, slice-of-life, and others. I don't shy away from the dark and gritty themes either. Throw me all the angst and pain. I absolutely love discussing plot and characters.\n\nI'm really searching for some strong, confident male characters! I'm getting a little bored of shy, clueless males right now.

            "selftext": "\n\nHeathcliffe Heights is a small, dreary town in upstate New York that was known more for being rainy than it is for literally anything else. It consisted of a small downtown area with multiple shops and a few outdated  places for entertainment, 3 schools, a middle class suburb, a smaller, more upper class neighborhood further up the hill that the town was built around, and a more rural area that had old graveyards, churches, and a lake.\n\nThe DeWinters had just moved into one of the houses on Belial Lane, the row of upper middle to high class houses that looked down on the small town of Heathcliffe Heights. Dante DeWinter looked out of the window of his parent\u2019s black SUV as they pulled into the driveway of their new home. It was a large, Victorian era house mostly surrounded by trees save for the front. His family valued their privacy, so that was a big plus. \u201cIt seems we\u2019ve arrived. The furniture is already here so let\u2019s go ahead and bring our own things up.\u201d Dante\u2019s father, Caine said as he turned off the SUV and got out. Dante let out a small sigh, his breath fogging the glass of the window a little before he got out as well. The fresh fall wind tugged at his denim jacket as he stepped onto the gravel of the driveway. \u201cThis blows. We should\u2019ve stayed in Washington.\u201d Those words, accompanied by a huff came from the other side of the SUV from Circe, Dante\u2019s sister. Four years younger than him and going through the rebellious teen girl phase, she was a handful. \u201cLanguage, Circe. You\u2019ve yet to give the place a chance. Give it time before you jump to judgement.\u201d Smooth words from Minerva, Dante\u2019s mother. \n\nIt took him time to bring all of his things up to his room at the end of the hall on the second floor. It was a decent size with enough space to fit the various things he liked to collect. Though, he could already hear the faint sound of melodramatic music coming from his sister\u2019s room two doors down, Dante was fairly happy with his personal space. He walked over to the one window of the room, sitting down in the windowsill. The view of the town below was perfect, and he could even see Wayne Polk High School where he would be attending for his final year of high school. \u201cUgh..\u201d he wasn\u2019t too happy about that. Especially since he didn\u2019t need to attend school. Why would he need to go to school to gain useless knowledge? Dante had basically eternity to learn things.. He and his family were vampires after all.\n\nHey! I\u2019ve been recently inspired to try a romantic RP with gothic, supernatural elements and I\u2019d like one of you to join me in creating a longterm story with many different themes! This RP is very opened ended as far as plot and direction go! If you have any ideas about anything, I\u2019d love to hear as I\u2019m not looking to carry the entire story on my own. If possible, I\u2019d love to do a Vampire x Human pairing, but you\u2019re not limited to that. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested, message me on Reddit.\n\nI\u2019m more likely to respond if you tell me what your favorite movie, tv show, or video game is. Hope to see you there.",

What I'd love to do in our roleplay is explore more of his past, before he was the Symbol of Peace, and probably throw some headcanons in the mix.\n\nNow then! What I can offer is good grammar, detailed and frequent replies (at least once a day), lots of awful jokes and angst! Oh boy do I love torturing my characters. \n\nIf you are the same as me and like the idea of the roleplay, great! You can be any character from the show (that existed back then) or an OC, if you'd like. \n\nI don't have any preferences for the plot, it can be romance/action/angst, whatever you desire! I just really want to explore him more. I may have a few ideas that you can learn about by sending a message. \n\nI do have two rules though. First is that I use Discord only and second, you must be under 25 years old. I am a minor myself, so if that bothers you, I don't think this ad's for you.\n\nAnyway, in case you fit the requirements, I really hope you send me a PM or your Discord tag and we can have a plus ultra roleplay!

Totally up to you! \n\nTO BE CLEAR, THESE ARE CHARACTERS I WANT MY PARTNER TO PLAY AS. There has been some confusion lately as to what this list is for. My top favorite characters will be in italics. \n\nG.I. Joe: obvious choice first, Baroness/Destro or Baroness/Cobra Commander. I'm also open to Scarlett and Lady Jaye.\n\nGame of Thrones: Pretty much anything goes here. Any characters and any scenarios. My preferences are *Dany*, Margaery, *Sansa*, Cersei and Arya. But I do prefer a more romantic type of scenario, like a courtship. That being said, I'm open to a lot more. After the episode last night, I\u2019m open to rewriting as much of the show as you want to craft a better ending. \n\n**Marvel Comics**: *Mary Jane Watson*, Black Cat, *She-Hulk*, Jean Gray, X-23, Susan Storm, Kitty Pryde, Rogue, *Scarlet Witch*, Gamora, *Nebula*, Elektra, Jessica Jones, *Captain Marvel*, *Black Widow*, The Wasp, *Mystique* and Gwen Stacy are my favs. However I am open to all sorts of characters and ideas on this one. (If you do this or DC, I'll jump right onboard) (I have an absolute assload of ideas surrounding Endgame and the aftermath, including fitting some non-MCU pieces into the MCU) \n\n**DC Comics**: *Batgirl*, Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, Zatanna, Power Girl, Super Girl, *Wonder Woman*. Again, open to all sorts of characters here.\n\nMass Effect: This is the only one I have a preference on who I play. I prefer to play either Garrus or BroShep. I'm open to pretty much any female character here, but my personal faves are any of the Asari, *Vetra*, Tali or FemShep. Also willing to do something Andromeda related.\n\nStar Wars: Open to anything really. Especially EU characters. Leia, *Rey*, Padme, and Phasma are the top choices as of now. Qi\u2019ra (Emilia Clarke\u2019s character in Solo) is of particular interest to me as of now. \n\nMetal Gear Solid: Anything involving Big Boss or Solid Snake. Particularly drawn to The Boss and Quiet right now. \n\nMortal Kombat: *Sonya*, Kitana, Mileena, Jade, *Cassie*, and Jacqui. \n\nStar Trek: No one really specific. The three I'm personally interested in are Janeway, Seven of Nine and Troi. But I'm pretty much open to everyone, including OCs.\n\nThere are also a number of celebrities that I\u2019m open to using, including many of the actresses that portray the characters I\u2019ve listed here. As well as a few other non-fandom ideas I have. Feel free to ask about this option as well! \n\nAll roles are 18+ and to be played as adults. \n\nIf none of these options feel suitable to you, feel free to name your favorites and I can see what I can work with. And if you come across this post at any time, it\u2019s still open for responses!",

            "selftext": "Hey, everyone. These days I'm usually looking for fandoms, but I decided to resurrect all my old original concepts on the off chance I might find a really great partnership (or two). Hopefully I'll catch someone's eye. (:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do have a few things for which I'm specifically looking in a partner, though, so let me lay those out for you before I get ahead of myself:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. I'm looking for \"advanced/literate\" partners with as much love of the language as I have (know your possessives, \"your\" vs. \"you're,\" proper comma usage, flowing sentence structure, etc.).\n2. I only do hetero pairings, and my characters in these ideas are all female.\n3. I'm a SFW writer. Think PG-13; I love romance and conflict, but don't get gross.  That said, 18+ partners are still preferred. I'm in my mid-20s, so I don't feel comfortable writing with minors.\n4. Email is preferred, but I can do others. Just ask.\n5. I don't do one-liners. Multi-para, please. Give me something to work with (without giving me eight-page novellas every post).\n6. Sometimes I disappear. It happens. I have major depressive disorder and can sometimes lack the motivation to reply. If that happens, poke me. I might say I'm not into it, or I might just be having a bad day. If it doesn't work out between us, please know that it's me - not you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlrighty, so, ideas next? I think so.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n~~A.~~ **~~Moon Dancers (Medieval Fantasy):~~**\n\n~~Most of life as humanity knows it is lived during the day. The world awakens at dawn and retires at dusk, unfailingly. There are nocturnal beasts, of course, but those are just animals. And what traveler or criminal hasn\u2019t stayed up to walk by the moonlight many a time himself? Even still, night is meant for sleep and silence, and daytime for work and play.  But that\u2019s not true of every sentient race in the world.~~\n\n~~There is a race of people, called the Aventine (AH-ven-teen), who not only live their lives at night, but are physically incapable of retaining consciousness in the daytime. Think of them as the \u201celves\u201d of the world \u2013 magical, fairly mysterious, largely peaceful, in tune with nature. Not a lot has been known about them over the centuries. They keep to themselves most of the time.~~\n\n~~In old days, they would even play harmless, good-natured tricks on their human counterparts, or leave playful messages, or sit and soothe a child who had awakened in the night while his parents slept on. There was goodwill between the two peoples. They were seen as anything from myth and folklore, to guardian angels, to fairies, to spirits of good fortune and blessing. But just as with anything people don\u2019t understand, mystery eventually turned to wariness. A wedge was driven between them as mutual suspicion and fear began to take root, and the \u201cMoon Dancers\u201d (humanity\u2019s nickname for them) withdrew into themselves. They have to be the more proactive in protecting themselves, after all, because of their very nature.~~\n\n~~Like I said, the Aventine are only active at night. When the morning comes, they immediately fall into a deep slumber, like flowers that only bloom in the evening. Nothing can break that sleep, and it\u2019s not possible to \u201cstay up late.\u201d They\u2019re completely vulnerable if this happens out in the world \u2013 not something you really want when the other race finds you unnerving at best and downright malicious at worst. What usually happens, and is supposed to happen, is that they retreat into the Vale, a magical  place kind of existing outside the normal realm. There, they\u2019re free to sleep and dream away the whole day.~~\n\n~~Now, I have in mind to play a young Aventine woman with your typical failings of curiosity, rebelliousness, wanderlust, and inquisitiveness. She\u2019s restless with this careful life of secrecy, always watching the sleepy human towns and villages, wondering if they\u2019re really so bad. I\u2019d like the other role to be left up to you: do you want to play a human? Someone who encounters her, with ensuing potential for adventure as they learn about each other and have to protect each other from their respective peoples? Or do you want to play another Aventine who is either tasked with  keeping her out of trouble or is trying to convince her because he actually cares for her, with that potential for adventure as they\u2019re discovered and cut off from the Vale and have to navigate this terrifying world ruled by humans? There are lots of possibilities here, and I\u2019d really like to brainstorm with you more about the world, the story, etc. The only thing I ask is to play against a male character, because\u2026hopeless romantic.\\~~~\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nB. **The Wyv (Medieval Fantasy):**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are beings called Wyverns in the world. They have a form that looks like normal humans on the surface, and they were once a thriving, powerful race. They have formidable magic, live extraordinarily long lives, are even purported to have prophetic capabilities, and their other forms are similar to dragons - hence the name. Derp. They lived largely in peace with the other races of the world, even somewhat deified by mortals.\n\nA long time ago, the other races of the world started hunting them like animals, sometimes for the hide of their beast forms, sometimes to harness their magic. They were largely wiped out over the years and are now very rare and \\*very\\* hidden. A lot of people actually think they're extinct, and some don't believe they were ever anything more than legends and fairy tales. The discovery of one would be a big deal, and among nations that are in conflict, having something like that in their arsenal would give the holder quite an edge.\n\nI would like to play a young Wyv either in captivity by one such nation, or on the run from it, and I'm looking for someone to build his/her own \\*non-Wyv\\* character and collaborate on the world and story with me. I want you to have creative freedom with your character. The only thing I ask is that there be no human-animal hybrids, and no other Wyv. That would defeat the purpose.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nC. **Demon Seed (Medieval Fantasy):**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, the idea is that there's this one kind of magic that is seen as unholy and evil. It's also an exceedingly rare gift; someone is born with it only once every (insert large amount of time here). There is a legend and superstition surrounding them that says they're the descendants of a demon who in ancient times came and bred with mortal races to corrupt them and steal them away from their benevolent gods. These people are referred to as demon seeds and are both hated and feared. They're seen as bringers of death and misfortune. And over the eons, this view has been supported by the seeds - because being hated and mistreated will ruin people, and many of them became the villains everyone said they were.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girl will be the current seed, shrouded in superstition, trying to make sense of what she actually is and how the world sees her. I'd like to discuss more world- and story-building with my partner and leave the other character up to you entirely.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nD. **Inseparable (Medieval Fantasy):**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis one is actually the only one in which I'm not looking for romance. Rather, I'm looking for a deep platonic bond between my character, a sentient creature type, and yours, some sort of humanoid creation (the only races I'd like to avoid are the ones considered half creature/half human).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, bear with me, here. My character is a half-demon (apparently I'm in a demonic mood?) tigress. There are two \"clans,\" for lack of a better word, of feline creatures that are more than just wild animals. They're bigger, they're sentient, they can \"speak\"; think of them as more spirit creatures than animals. I gave them ridiculously corny names eight years ago when I came up with this, so I'm not going to embarrass myself by putting them here - but essentially, the panthers are bad, and the tigers are...considerably more benevolent. You do not want to run into a panther at the best of times; you only have to worry about a tiger if you've wronged them or the lands they protect. Panthers are demon-cats, like one of my tabbies would be if she had supernatural abilities. If it helps, I'll call the tigers the angels. Guardian spirits, more like.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo. My character is the product of mixed parentage. Her mother was a tiger; her father was a panther. Don't ask how that happened. The world is not black and white. She lost her mother as a cub, however, when poachers raided the glen her kind called home and pretty much wiped them out (my guess is they had some help, if you know what I mean). I would like to find someone to play a character who finds this little mystical fuzzball, \"raises her,\" probably without either of them really knowing what she is, and thus creates such a sweet, timeless bond of friendship.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe could either start with their meeting and then time-skip to adulthood a few years later, or start with adulthood. Beyond that, the challenges they face, the rest of the story, any baggage of your character's own to bring into play - that's all open and up for discussion. It's just the relationship and my own character I have.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nE. **Wishes &amp; Whims (Flexible):**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I had a dream last night, and it's led me to doing some plotting and musing today. I'd like to do something involving a genie, of sorts - only not exactly the typical \"three wishes\" deal. I envision young female spirit sort of being, trapped by some great power and freed by a young man, who then becomes her \"master.\" Now, I'm not talking about \\*that\\* kind of master, so kindly get your mind out of the gutter. She would attach to him; want to do things for him and make him happy; protect him at all cost. It may be that once, these beings were in partnership with humanity (and/or other mortal races); a soul link would be created between two individuals who were compatible, and they would fight together, with the human(oid) channeling the spirit's energy. I'm thinking that there are certain people who are \\*born\\* with the innate ability to link with them. Perhaps humanity began taking advantage of this partnership/pact system, however, and began using the links to conquer instead of just protect. So, most of them abandoned humanity and refuse to pact now - but she didn't. She still believes, and is waiting for her soulmate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOr maybe she's just extremely grateful to be freed. I kind of like pact systems, and a bond growing out of that, but I'm totally open to discussion and brainstorming, too! It's just a rough idea I pulled out of the air, anyway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nF. **Fish Out of Water (Realistic/Fantasy):**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(Note: This is probably the lowest on my preference list. I've had a few attempts to start it, but it always sort of falls flat. So I'd love to get a really good version going, but I'm a little discouraged about it. Keep that in mind.)\n\nThis is kind of a mix of modern realistic and medieval fantasy settings. It involves a young man from the \"real\" world (our world), and a girl from another world entirely; a world with magic and knights and medieval kingdoms. However, unlike your typical, patriarchal systems, her homeland recognizes equal female authority, as well as female knights and warriors. The world from which she hails is currently under threat of cataclysm, and the girl in question is one of those warriors. Though young, she was tracking down some magical doo-dad to help her country turn the tide of impending doom, but she was intercepted by a powerful sorcerer on the other side. There was a fight, and in the commotion, the artifact was destabilized, and there was an accident. She (along with the object) got dumped into another realm. Boom. Earth. She has no idea where she is, or how to navigate this odd place and its even odder customs.\n\nEnter your character. Whether he's some plain 9-to-5-er, or something more interesting - that's up to you. It may even turn out he's some special, prophesied hero in her world and doesn't know it. The point is the comedy, frustration, and emotion of the fish out of water situation. If you've seen the movie, Enchanted, you can see an example of that - though I'm not intending to play a giddy, stereotypical Disney princess. She's fiery and determined. I do want a bond to form between them, though. And eventually, I think it would even be cool to take the RP back into \\*her\\* world, where \\*he's\\* the one floundering,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nG. **Reverse Phantom of the Opera (Paranormal or Fantasy):**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I've finally seen the show, and I love it, but I'm not looking for a direct copy.  It simply serves as the inspiration for an idea I had; I'd like to change up the genders (i.e. female phantom) and potentially make her \\*actually\\* a ghost of sorts, or some other kind of being, \"haunting\" the theater. It's really just a rough, vague concept, but it's open to all kinds of discussion and interpretation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nH. **Post-Apocalyptic:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't really have any specifics on this; it's more a general genre. However, I do not want zombies. I want something more sci-fi and dystopian than horror or fantasy. Ruined civilizations, humanity struggling to survive... That kind of thing. Rating rules *still* apply here, though!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI. **Paranormal Collaboration:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTalking actual ghosts, here, not just things flying off shelves a la corny ghost hunting \"documentaries.\" I'd love to play a ghost against a human. Skillet's song, \"Lucy,\" inspired me a bit here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJ. **Science Fiction Collaboration:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also love sci-fi and am happy to come up with an idea together. Except for my Star Trek love (Voyager), though, I'm not interested in space travel. I like artificial intelligence subjects and futuristic things, but not really keen on aliens and interstellar ambling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(I also have a vague inkling of an idea that draws off Nickelback's \"Lullaby\" and Within Temptation's \"Hand of Sorrow\"! More medieval fantasy. It has a lot of potential for emotion and conflict and development. Ask me about it!)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\~\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n...That was really long. I apologize. Hopefully, I didn't lose *all* of you to my incessant rambling. If you're still with me, please feel free to PM me. I **don't** respond to comments, so please use the PM function. Thanks!",

I like to try and put effort and thought into my replies and no matter what kind of character or however many you\u2019d like to play. I\u2019d hope you\u2019d do the same but I understand that writer\u2019s block and similar afflictions happen!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat I\u2019m hoping to do for this role-play is focus on the conflicts within Blackrock Mountain between the Firelord Ragnaros and the black dragon Nefarian and their associated minions.\n\nThe only thing I ask of you is that you write for Nefarian! I can help guide if you need some direction on how to do that if you'd like and you\u2019re more than welcome to have your own OC or whomever as well! Likewise, if there\u2019s anyone you\u2019d like to request me to write for, canon or OC I\u2019d be more than happy to!\n\nAs for the content of the story I\u2019m very open to different themes be they fluffy and romantic or dark and brutal or a mix of that and the between!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019m also completely okay with anything of a more intimate level but more than happy to work within your personal boundaries! I\u2019m open to communication (Story related and OOC!) and would much rather work through issues than simply ghost someone.\n\nIf this sounds like something you\u2019d be interested in, please message me directly!",
