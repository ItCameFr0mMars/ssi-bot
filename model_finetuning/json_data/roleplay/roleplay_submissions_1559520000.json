She was quick- in both body and mind, and though she'd never held a gun or had to fight anyone, she figured she'd grow into brutality. That was, if she ever did get a chance encounter...  \n\n\nBut here she was, suffocating from the fabric wrapped tightly around her chest to rid her of femininity for a while, hair tucked up under a cap, all makeup scrubbed from her fair skin and a convenient excuse to keep her family from intervention- all that just to be caught when she'd finally reach the military men at the front of the line.  \n\n\n(Hello all, just an inglorious basterds inspired something or rather. It can be loosely based, probably better that way for the sake of having some wiggle room. Are the basterds a group like the movie? Or perhaps just a one man show about to become a duo? Had they been watching the girl after hearing some rumours about her enthusiasm? Or were they waiting to scout various people who were rejected from the formal military?)",

I want depth and pain and beauty and drama and writing so delicious you could die. I'm not asking for much, just that special magic that can happen rarely when two talented minds meet a blank page and tackle it together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Come wander with me through worlds of our own making.\n\n# \n\nI am going to try and keep this as brief as possible while still offering as much information as I can so you can decide whether or not you think we'd mesh well before shooting me a PM.  &lt;3 **Bolded big stuff so you can skim, though**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Also please don't comment here, PM me if you want to communicate about anything written below.**\n\n# \u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\n\n# The big compatibility stuff/my preferences:\n\n**\u2661** I have been doing RP/one on one writing in some capacity or another for **\\~19 years**. It's why I can write to what I humbly believe to be at least a **somewhat decent** level. Being able to write every single day for months on end for more years of my life than not has given me invaluable experience in character creation, development, world building, narrative, all of it.\n\n**\u2661** I mention this because I would very much prefer it if you are also **literate** to **advanced literate** in your writing. I ask that you are fairly experienced with a firm grasp of spelling, grammar, and storytelling. I **don't** ask that you be perfect, I am a **better storyteller** than I am at grammar and punctuation and all that, tbh and as a warning. I'm gonna make glaring mistakes because the words were just rushing out too fast and I was blinded by the vision of the scene and the things I was trying to convey, but I do try my best.\n\nAll that to say again, we're both human, perfection isn't being sought here, but just write good, k?\n\n**\u2661** I use chat-speak in **ooc chatter**. I ramble. I overshare and brainstorm and will flood your messages while you're away\n\n**\u2661** I am **only** interested in **hetero romance** pairings. I know, ew, str8 ppl. But the heart wants what it wants, as we all know.\n\n**\u2661** I prefer **Discord/e-mail/G docs/PM** **of some sort** for the actual writing and **Discord** for ooc chatter and brainstorming.\n\n**\u2661** I **\\*really\\*** am not comfortable working with anyone younger than around **\\~22+** Like, I have **zero** interest and it'll be a flat **no** from me. Sorry.\n\n**\u2661** I do **lean** towards **favoring female writing partners**, trans women, of course included as long as you are willing to play cis males opposite my character. That's the **main requirement.** Not only a **willingness** but a **desire** to play a **male character in a romance story with a cis woman**. I just enjoy how easy it is to get on the same page with another woman. I won't turn you away if you're a guy but we're less prone to get on, I have found from experience. My last two long-term writing partners who I cherish dearly were female. If you're a talented writer though who loves romance and drama and world-building, don't hesitate to shoot your shot. &lt;3\n\n**\u2661** I don't know if this is a given, but I also ask that you **help** me populate the **side-characters** as needed for our world and our stories.\n\n**\u2661** **I do not like pre-made characters**. I expect that **all** characters used in our stories are made expressly for those stories.\n\n**\u2661** I write in **third person past-tense POV only**.\n\n**\u2661** I **only** use actors and models for **character references**.\n\n\u2661 I do **not** have many limits for adult themes and I do not fade to black but there must be a balance between those themes and storytelling, tipped in the favor of good, amazing storytelling and all the drama and pain of whatever situation plagues our characters. Please include your **NSFW** preferences in your introductory PM. **\u2661**\n\n**\u2661** SO yeah, just to make it a bullet point, I prefer **long-term** writing partners. We can certainly do **one-offs** for cravings, and leave and come back to stories and worlds and plots as we please, we are after all in charge, but I prefer to have one or two steady people I can turn to when I want to work on something either creatively for a few months or to satisfy a craving in the moment that may or may not turn into something long-term we work on or come back to.\n\n\u2661 **Please don't invite me to your group role-plays**. &lt;3 Thanks so much for the thought and I am flattered but I am only interested in one on one stuff for now. The most I would consider is maybe occasionally working together with a third party if you wanted to bring one in on discord someday.\n\n**\u2661** I **don't** tend to like **canon characters**. I will take ideas from characters and build something new around that, something similar, but still mine. I will also do this with settings, worlds, drawing from TV and movies and comics and books, etc. But I will never play a canon character and for me to play opposite one, as in you playing a canon character, would have to be a huge crave or a lot of convincing and pretense and plot that I like.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Take a look at what I am interested in actually writing just below, and if you find your interest piqued further and want to delve into any of these worlds with me and create some characters, get right into it and start brainstorming and seeing if we vibe, please send me a PM. Introduce yourself. If you have writing samples, send them. If you have questions, ask them. Ideas? Tell me them. \u2661\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What I want to actually write/loose plot/setting/character ideas -\n\n# \u2661\n\n**My biggest crave at the moment:**\n\nI want something set in a remote location, Alaska maybe, but I see a cabin surrounded by a seemingly endless landscape of snow and ice. Think North of the wall in GOT but in modern times, a few years into the future, likely after a shift because of climate change so maybe even someplace that was never historically even nearly this cold, thus why our characters would be stranded there and have to learn some of the skills they learn to survive without knowing them already. Maybe they meet not too long after the freeze which would have been sudden and apocalyptic a la that movie Day After Tomorow, and they're both barely hanging on. Maybe my character is a bit more established and takes yours in. We can iron out the meeting but I know I want a fairly gritty story with drama and danger and love and survival and some slice of life elements mixed in too, as being perpetually buried in snow leaves much time to pass and skip around and play in while they're just inside their refuge.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would like to see my character paired with a guy who is at least a few years older than her. Maybe he does have some survival skills/knowledge but he is injured and thus incapacitated, so she takes him in and heals him, he could trade that knowledge for shelter and safety and medicine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's just a few loose ideas at this point and I would love to brainstorm with you to iron out the details if this world and fragments I'm describing sound appealing. Picturing lots of snow, ice. Lots of danger in the cold. A romance that comes maybe unexpectedly but certainly inevitably after a medium to slow burn. Then maybe a family, a story of generations surviving. I like to take stories we tell on their own and once they've sort of run their course then open them up, expand on them. I like to add generations, tie things in with small details and in as many ways as I can organically work in. Even if we're someday telling a fantasy/sci-fi story, I may find a way to tie it back to this story. (Already know I'd propose a scenario where our characters or their descendants are taken off-planet to a habitable colony and/or planet. See? Already thinking.)\n\n# Other fragments of ideas:\n\n\u2661 **Westworld** \\- Two guests meet in the park (doesn't have to be exactly like the one in the show) and fall in love. Adventure and danger and lots of fun and drama could be outlined for this easily.\n\n\u2661 **RDR/The Revenant/Western US in the 1800s** \\- Pretty straight forward, just delving into a romance set in the wild west. Instead of being in a park and from a modern or futuristic present, we'd be dabbling in some historical fiction.\n\n\u2661 **Cold Mountain/US Civil War era** \\-   More specifically the civil war era in the southeastern US, all the way across the country from the above mentioned western US setting and a bit earlier. The 1860s. Different than the Western idea in that this would likely be set in the Appalachian Mountains. I imagine a lot of hardship, survival, hunting, war, love, etc. Not actually based on the book or the movie. Just the source of inspiration for a world for us to play in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese would need to be developed a lot more, but I truly love that kind of collaborative development of plot and characters, so that's fine by me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u2661I don't want any heavy sci-fi or fantasy type themes for now though if we write together for more than this story I am always open to sci-fi and fantasy themes in the future. I am more in the mood for gritty PA realism and love surviving and keeping two people going or something set in the 1800s. Either way, I want a heavy, unforgivably human type of story that will ultimately reward us with a beautiful narrative and characters that feel real and alive. Hopefully a friendship and/or writing partnership. Maybe the start of a whole new world we can dabble and play in at our leisure. That's always my hope.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want beauty and heartache and pain and drama and love and yeah, I want a little magic but not in the fantasy sense of the word. I want the magic of two creative, talented minds working together for a common goal and breathing life with words. I want a nice slow to medium-burn of a love story to start out hopefully many lovely stories we can tell together. There are universes to be made.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have characters already kind of fleshed out a bit in my mind and some ideas for side characters and plot and backstory and such for the craves listed here, depending on what your character is like and what we decide of course on for the tone and plot. I want some elements of slice of life, but forward-driving plot at a decent pace. I write with as much depth, detail, and color as I possibly can but sometimes it will be more casual, sometimes it will be really lengthy, just depending on mood.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**If any of this sounds good to you, please don't hesitate to PM me and we can go from there. Most of the above can be worked out.**\n\n# \u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\n\n# Bonus rambling:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u2661 Usually having the male main character at least a couple of years older than the character I am playing will end up being my vibe. I like to make female characters that challenge and assert against men who might consciously or unconsciously use age as an excuse to dismiss or otherwise silence or stifle them at the beginning, or if they're not the type sometimes also perhaps to use that juxtaposition of age and character for fun because of some of these societally pre-conceived notions, etc.\n\n\u2661 Taking breaks for burnout is totally fine, I will probably take a couple over the course of say, a year, and that's why I prefer having long-term partners. Ditching though, I don't appreciate and try not to do myself. Just let me know, I get it. We're human beings with lives and mental and physical health needs. Or maybe we just aren't meshing? Don't sweat it, just tell me. I will certainly try and do the same.\n\n\u2661 I can get **very** into world, mood and character building and have in the past collaborated on playlists, character references, setting reference, mood boards, etc. with writing partners to help expand on the world based on the mood, using these things as a way to further get on the same page so we can write in both the same tone and from the closest that I think two minds can probably get when working on one world together from two totally different upbringings, sometimes writing styles, background, history, experience, mood, locations in the world, etc. There are a lot of variables, but I feel like discussing characters and setting and vibes and themes you want to include and songs that make you think of a character or a moment or a feeling related to the story and all of that can level some of those variables and bring two people to the same place creatively. It's magic when it happens, and if you've experienced it you know it, and I guess that's what I am looking for again. A little magic, no big deal. Right?\n\n\u2661 I like to tell stories that can sometimes span generations. Maybe even time and space. But most important, stories about families and characters that feel real and who come to life for us. I like having things that I write with long-term writing partners eventually be woven together in some way or another, so that it's a cohesive world, even if in one story we're dabbling in Science Fiction and then in another maybe historical fiction or slice of life or anything in-between. I love doing stuff like that and being collaborative about world building and borrowing characters and adding generations and ancestors and relatives to families as we go and as the opportunity arises no matter the genre or era we are writing in. I've yet to meet a plot line I can't at least loosely tie together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# PM ME NOW IF YOU'VE MADE IT THIS FAR! \u2661",

I have never done a roleplay where I have specifically controlled the story, but I do love to write, create plots and characters, so I think it would be right up my alley. \n\nThe plot that I have is below, I am looking for someone who is happy to have me as their GM, and likes a good slice of life/romance plot. Someone who can be patient and understanding that I am learning the ropes. I love sending music, imagery, and hearing whatever you have to say. \n\nThe rp will have you, the main character who is a human, male or female it is up to you, who has been going about their normal everyday life. Our story takes place in the port city Osaka. You have just graduated high school the year previous, and have since found work to keep you busy and save some money up. However, since leaving high school behind, despite living in such a lively city, you start to become more aware of how lonely you are. You have great friends of course, and you have no major issues at work, but you have realized that you never seemed to have deep romantic feelings for anyone. You had crushes like anybody else would growing up, and had a couple of partners, but none that were too serious. Whether they were too full of themselves or the feelings faded for eachother. There was always something. One night while you are walking home from work, eyes cast up towards the sky, you see a shooting star. You were never really one to believe in such magic, yet still, you closed your eyes, and secretly make a wish to yourself that you may find what you have been lacking. After opening your eyes and turning your attention back to the road ahead, you are surprised to see two figures, dressed in stark white and elegant gold accessories. Though they appear to be wearing modern clothes, something about the man and woman seems otherworldly. If not for the way they looked, it was the way they spoke. \n\n\"It is a pleasure to meet you.\" The woman chirps happily, a radiant smile gracing her features. \n\n\"We've had our eyes on you for some time now, it's about time you summoned us.\" The male is the first to approach you, his voice demanding your attention as the distance between you shrinks. They don't appear to have any weapons on hand, but the way they talk about you summoning them is a little unnerving. \n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nLike I mentioned, you are a human, and the two strangers are Angels. Your character does not know it, but in another life, you did know each of them. And one of them is your soulmate. If you want to see the rest unfold, you'll have to see ot for yourself \u2661\n\nIf that caught your attention, do feel free to message me and we can get started!",

I often don't put too much about myself here because If you're truly interested I often prefer you ask me yourself!\n\nI'm looking for something involving me playing a soldier. Whether that be modern day, during the Wild West, or perhaps even some alternate future or past? I want to explore characters who are broken, who find it nearly impossible to exist outside of their experience as a soldier. I have a few character ideas to go with this craving! One is a Combat Medic that would serve in the very slight future, in a fictional war between nations without nuclear weapons. For her, I am more then fine with either exploring her during her service, or post. Then there is the Captain in the Union army, who is as ruthless as she is quiet. A woman of few words, with a long service record behind her of bloody battle. Perhaps could even explore the fact that she isn't a hero, especially not after committing so many acts of terrible war against the Natives. I would also be willing to explore either during her time as a soldier, or post.~\n\nI would like there to be romance with my characters, though that only applies to female/female pairings. I only play romance stories when its girl/girl, so please keep that in mind! Sex is open for male partners with my character, but not romance.\n\nI'm very friendly and approachable, but I dislike writers who can't atleast give me two para's a reply. If you are someone who isn't able to hit that criteria, or isn't sure, then It would be best for you to move on. \u2665 PM me if interested! I'll give you my Discord tag and we can discuss all sorts of lovely stuff.",

            "selftext": " \n\n**Rookshaven** is one of the longest running, lore-intensive group role playing storylines on Discord right now.\n\nBased in present-day northern Scotland, Rookshaven Academy and University is a school for mages, though the storyline only allows for university students and professors to be applied. We're about 30+ players strong!\n\n**A bit about our lore:**\n\nThe mage community has always held their royal families above the rest. Though they aren't considered kings or queens of their mage classes anymore, the royal families are believed to be the first blood lines to develop their particular kind of magics. As such, royalty have always been the law-makers for mages worldwide. In the late 1800s, a rebel sect of mages rose up to attack the royals and all of their complicit, loyal subjects - resulting in a Mage Civil War.\n\nMany mages and their royal families were killed off, while the beast mage class disappeared entirely. From that war, the High Council was formed. A collection of the remaining royal houses, electing one member of their family to represent them in the governing of the mage community.\n\nUnfortunately, out of the original eight royal families, only four are alive in present day. Additionally, two new mage classes have been discovered. Without a way to track the new class's lineage, Mythics and Necromancers have been left without a representative in the Council. As a result, many laws passed since their discovery have been created seemingly for the purpose of keeping Necromancers and Mythics at a disadvantage. While the newest class, Mythics, are sigil-bound at a young age to feel an automatic pull toward royal families, they often grow up to be employed as maids or servants for the royals.\n\nSince 2016, another uprising of rebels has been seen. Between then and 2019 (present day), many royals and loyalists alike have lost their lives in terrorist attacks by these Rebels. In the last year of the group story on Discord, students have been attacked both on and off campus, leading many to believe there are Rebels among the ranks of Rookshaven, despite the school being run by the Council.\n\nAs of January 1st, 2019, the light binding Royal family in its entirety was wiped out in an attack from a hybridized spell known as Shadow Fire.\n\n**What you can expect:**\n\n\\- Monthly events in which your character can earn points to put into their dice, making them stronger.\n\n\\- Lots of lore.\n\n\\- High Activity.\n\n\\- Outlined mage classes, as well as factions to push their own agendas (Royals, Loyalists, Rebels, Sympathizers).\n\n\\- Friendly players willing to work with new players to create backstories and social networks.\n\n\\- A secondary server only viewable to applied and approved players where you can post playlists, aesthetic images, social media posts, journal entries, as well as having 1-2 private channels specific to your character for housing and training.\n\n\\- Active Staff willing to help new players any way we can and get players immersed in the story faster.\n\n\\- Patience. It's a lot of lore. It's okay if it takes a while to get through it all.\n\n\\- An NPC Library to check out characters for scenes when your own characters are locked down.\n\n\\- Full transparency. We hold honesty and clear communication above everything.\n\n**What we expect:**\n\n\\- literacy\n\n\\- a 3 paragraph minimum per post (there are exceptions to this, but the majority of players should strive for this)\n\n\\- realistic characters that fit the server lore\n\n\\- activity every 2 weeks, or communication with the Admins if you need to take time away\n\n\\- read the FAQ\n\n\\- a drive to grow as a writer\n\n**Classes Available:**\n\n\\- Air\n\n\\- Fire\n\n\\- Water\n\n\\- Darkness\n\n\\- Light\n\n\\- Spirit\n\n\\- Earth\n\n\\- Necromancy\n\n\\- Beast (small wait list)\n\n**Locked Classes:**  \n\\- Hybrid Mages (mages born from opposite classed parents, or from one Mirskoy parent)  \n\\- Variant Mages (mages descended from hybrids whose abilities manifest as a variation of two classes)\\*  \n\\- Mythic Class \\*\n\n\\* *Available as a secondary character with Admin approval, or as a check-out from the NPC library.*\n\n**Royal Families Available:**\n\n\\- Air ( 1 open availability slot left)\n\n\\- Fire\n\n\\- Dark\n\n\\- Spirit\n\n**Upcoming/Ongoing Events:**  \n\\- Hybrid Relations Act Event (abduction &amp; experimentation on hybrid mages)  \n\\- Internment Arc  \n\\- Summer Trips  \n\\- Sigil Exclusion Arc  \n\\- Alumni Formal  \n\\- Tattoo Arc\n\n[Link to Rookshaven on Discord](https://discord.gg/64HWFYy)",

I have the ability to reply at least once, if not more, in a day. Please don't let this be a deterrent. Another thing -- I absolutely love OOC chatter and I try to communicate regularly even if we aren't writing back and forth.\n\nI only write using Discord!\n\nMy style of writing is third-person, past-tense paragraph(s). My quantity varies with the plot and the scene in the plot. Dialogue is generally shorter; however, I am not against writing three to four paragraphs if the moment in the plot calls for it. I will not write with anyone who uses first person.\n\nI will write any gender in any pairing. I am comfortable with writing NSFW themes but I ask that you are eighteen or older because I don't particularly like the idea of going to jail.\n\nMy plots will always include romance because I absolutely adore it and I will never tire of writing it. However, I am particularly fond of slowburn romance as frustrating as it can become! The genres I am searching for are post-apocalypse or slice-of-life. I don't shy away from the dark and gritty themes either. Throw me all the angst and pain. I absolutely love discussing plot and characters.\n\nI'm really searching for some strong, confident characters! I'm getting a little bored of shy, clueless characters right now. Sorry!\n\nI'm currently searching for some plots but I'm open to more but I will absolutely LOOOOVE you if you give me one of these\n\n\u2022 A 'country boy' romance aesthetic because I've been listening too far too much Taylor Swift recently\n\n\u2022 A summer road trip\n\n\u2022 A character is staying at their grandmother's beach house (and knows no one else) and her grandmother didn't tell them about the cute character than comes to clean a couple times a week\n\n\u2022 Cute cliches are my weakness\n\nI don't know if I missed anything. Chances are I did. However, if my post intrigues you, feel free to send me a little orange envelope! Try to intrigue me, too, please, where I feel more compelled to reply.\n\nThanks!",

Your great-great grandmother was a gypsy and traveled far and wide, collecting all kinds of odd trinkets and baubles. That was many years ago and she\u2019s long passed since then. One night during a s\u00e9ance you tried contacting the other side, full moon, candles, incense, herbs. The whole nine yards. The wind howled outside as your bedroom window flew open to the city night. Any minor illumination was snuffed out in one quick swell. You waited\u2026and waited for something to contact you that evening but nothing came of it. The next morning you went about your day as normal, until you came home. A large demonic beast sat upon your bed in your studio apartment. The cat hissed at him relentlessly from afar on the dining table. It was just about dinner time, the sun was setting over on the horizon and here you were, face to face with a devil.  \n \n\n(Hey, buddy. I\u2019m looking for a modern time occult RP. Slice of life/Romance/Drama. Where you\u2019ve summoned a demon that just so happens to be bound to your apartment quarters.   \nCan be short term or long term.   \n What you plan to do with him is up to you.   \n IRL I\u2019m a 22M and I expect you to be 18+  \n I\u2019m semi-literate and willing to work with whatever character you plan to whip up. No real preferences.  \nCan be written in either 3rd or 1st person but no \\*actions\\*   \n My preferred platforms are Discord and Chatzy. Shoot me a DM if you\u2019re interested.)",

I\u2019m hoping to find a long-term role-play partner, that will, in their free time, indulge in descriptive, literate storytelling surrounding an interesting, male/female love story that we can come up with together. I wish to have a partner that can spell correctly, use correct grammar (not that I\u2019m perfect all the time), as well as punctuation, capitalization, and be admirably descriptive in their writing. I don\u2019t exactly desire extreme novels to be sent back, and forth, just messages containing enough effort of description so we, each-other, can really understand, see, hear, and feel what\u2019s going on for our characters in the role-play. A lot of the time, I set up a role-play with somebody, and get so excited, because they seem super literate, and descriptive, and passionate about what they write, but then they shock me with one, little paragraph replies. I hope I don\u2019t seem too picky or anything, because I certainly don\u2019t nag anybody for writing mistakes, but I just want to receive the same amount of effort that I put into the story. \ud83d\ude42 I\u2019m also looking for somebody who prefers a build-up to NSFW. If there\u2019s no build-up, it has to at least contribute, and make sense with the story, which I wouldn\u2019t mind at all!\n\nI do have a list of role ideas, if you\u2019d like to have a look at it, as I would be willing to hear any of your ideas, as well! I\u2019m open-minded, and I hope you\u2019ll be, too. I seek honesty, and communication between me and my role-play partner, yet as for general communication and conversation apart from the rp, I\u2019m not MUCH of a talker. Of course, I won\u2019t ignore you OOC, I just have my intentions set more on the role-play, and getting to know your writing skills, rather. \ud83d\ude0a Hope that\u2019s okay! \n\nI do Discord only! If you\u2019re interested, please send a message my way, and please include your Discord username. It would also be a bonus if I saw a writing sample of yours! I like to check if my potential rp partner\u2019s writing style clashes with mine well. Hope to hear from you. \ud83e\udd29",

I have over 10 years of Roleplay experience and crave a fantasy that sings of reality. I want a gritty and terrible origin for our characters, with a recurring theme of striving to escape the unfavorable circumstances of lowtown birth.)\n\n\"A Dark Apprenticeship... But the only light we might ever see. You understand that... Right?\"\n\nOn the western tip of the nation-continent of Ferus lies the city state known as Grayme. It's high city is the pride of the west, a veritable paradise of mongrel culture- weaving the cultures of neighboring and faraway lands alike into a tapestry that can only be described as beautiful, in all of its ugliness. Nobles play a constant game of intrigue, deception, and plots to gain more influence- oft times at the tip of an assassin's blade.\n\nBut that is not where our story begins. Our duo were born as street rats, either bastard children shunned to lowtown, or street rats tossed from one of its many bordello. Lowtown is the land of the poor, the dirt and grime of the city. We have never seen the light of the high city, and the smell of drunken vomit and blood are much too familiar for these young ones. We make our way as thieves, barely paying dues to the local guild in order to survive. In a world where thieves only last so long, and base hitmen are only as good as their skill, what can we do but to survive. Yet, even in the detritus of low town, the young might dream of an escape...\n\nAlbeit a less than noble path, rumor has it that the legendary assassin known as Spathi is searching for an apprentice. One who works directly for the Black Hand... Would he take two? Can we survive the strife of Lowtown long enough to find him? And even if we could... What would the price of such teaching even be?\n\nWith guild dues only piling higher and higher, we're left with little choice. As long as either of us could remember, we've been each other's saving grace. This plan is all we have. Tonight's mark just might have enough money to get his attention, too.",

My length is usually like 1-2 paragraphs, depending on how the scene is going; sometimes things stay short for a bit especially when lots of back and forth dialogue is happening, and some get quite a bit longer than normal. I'd also like to get at least a few responses a day out, but I know life can get busy and sometimes it slows down, sometimes free days speed up, that's all good.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs my title states, I want a good fantasy and adventure roleplay, with magic, dragons, mythical creatures and fantastical races/monsters, all that jazz. Either romance or staying platonic is fine with me. Ideally, the RP would be neither entirely lighthearted comedy nor 100% grim seriousness; I like a bit of both. NSFW stuff is totally okay - not just smut, but other mature themes - and I have some plot ideas (tbh the ones I wanna do most are pretty weird though).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUsing either Discord or Kik is acceptable \\^\\^ Just message me with a username for which you want to use and we can get to plotting and setting things up.",

            "selftext": "I'm looking for someone who would be interested in roleplaying as characters from, but not limited to, these universes. This does not necessarily need to be sexual in nature. Totally up to you! \n\nTO BE CLEAR, THESE ARE CHARACTERS I WANT MY PARTNER TO PLAY AS. There has been some confusion lately as to what this list is for. My top favorite characters will be in italics. \n\nG.I. Joe: obvious choice first, Baroness/Destro or Baroness/Cobra Commander. I'm also open to Scarlett and Lady Jaye.\n\nGame of Thrones: Pretty much anything goes here. Any characters and any scenarios. My preferences are *Dany*, Margaery, *Sansa*, Cersei *Brienne* and Arya. But I do prefer an element of romance to the scenario. That being said, I'm open to a lot more. After the episode last night, I\u2019m open to rewriting as much of the show as you want to craft a better ending. \n\n**Marvel Comics**: *Mary Jane Watson*, Black Cat, *She-Hulk*, Jean Gray, X-23, Susan Storm, Kitty Pryde, Rogue, *Scarlet Witch*, Gamora, *Nebula*, Elektra, Jessica Jones, *Captain Marvel*, *Black Widow*, The Wasp, *Mystique* and Gwen Stacy are my favs. However I am open to all sorts of characters and ideas on this one. (If you do this or DC, I'll jump right onboard) (I have an absolute assload of ideas surrounding Endgame and the aftermath, including fitting some non-MCU pieces into the MCU) \n\n**DC Comics**: *Batgirl*, Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, Zatanna, Power Girl, Super Girl, *Wonder Woman*. Again, open to all sorts of characters here.\n\nMass Effect: This is the only one I have a preference on who I play. I prefer to play either Garrus or BroShep. I'm open to pretty much any female character here, but my personal faves are any of the Asari, *Vetra*, Tali or FemShep. Also willing to do something Andromeda related.\n\nStar Wars: Open to anything really. Especially EU characters. Leia, *Rey*, Padme, and Phasma are the top choices as of now. Qi\u2019ra (Emilia Clarke\u2019s character in Solo) is of particular interest to me as of now. \n\nMetal Gear Solid: Anything involving Big Boss or Solid Snake. Particularly drawn to The Boss and Quiet right now. \n\nMortal Kombat: *Sonya*, Kitana, Mileena, Jade, *Cassie*, and Jacqui. \n\nStar Trek: No one really specific. The three I'm personally interested in are Janeway, Seven of Nine and Troi. But I'm pretty much open to everyone, including OCs.\n\nThere are also a number of celebrities that I\u2019m open to using, including many of the actresses that portray the characters I\u2019ve listed here. As well as a few other non-fandom ideas I have. Feel free to ask about this option as well! \n\nAll roles are 18+ and to be played as adults. \n\nIf none of these options feel suitable to you, feel free to name your favorites and I can see what I can work with. And if you come across this post at any time, it\u2019s still open for responses!",

I'd also like to focus on his younger years, before and possibly during his prime. Would love to have a lot of angst, if you're into that, too. \n\nI use past tense, 3rd person, details, Discord only and I can reply at the very least once a day. I know life's more important, but if you are going to be gone for a lengthy period of time, I'd like to know. I'd also like to know if the roleplay isn't to your liking. Don't just ghost people, that's rude.\n\nAnyway! You can play as any canon character (that was alive back then) and you could possibly play as the GM or you can play as an OC and them and Yagi can develop a bond or friendship. (No NSFW though)\n\nWhat I also ask of you is that you're under 30 years of age, as I myself am a minor. If you're not comfortable with that, then this ad's not for you.\n\nThis is about it. For the plot, you can shoot me a message and we can discuss it more. Thanks for reading my ad! Have a plus ultra day!",

I have about 1 or 2 good roleplays at any point, but I\u2019d really appreciate having a few more so I don\u2019t get too bored.\n\nIn terms of what I roleplay, I really enjoy fantasy elements in the roleplay and this usually takes the form of medieval fantasy. But I also enjoy roleplays like sci-fi, western, or anything else really. Although I enjoy fantasy elements I\u2019m really ok for any kind of roleplay as long as it\u2019s fun!\n\nI roleplay in the third person and tend to type quite a bit. Depending on the roleplay, the partner, and the scene it can differ quite a bit, but generally I enjoy having environmental and emotional detail put into every post. I find it hard to stay interested in a roleplay where I\u2019m doing double the work, so sorry to those people!\n\nAgain I\u2019m ok with NSFW themes, but it has to make sense and involve the right character. Like if I make a sultry, bombastic character then it makes sense to have more NSFW posts and themes. But for most other characters it\u2019s not going to be happening terribly often unless we talk about it before hand.\n\nI think that\u2019s everything, I can use mostly any platform but prefer discord so let\u2019s see if we can figure something out!",

I usually play the role of the \"DM\" or \"GM\" or perhaps \"Narrator\" as well as playing the roles of important side characters. I also build the entire roleplay, the world, the story, the encounters, everything.\n\nI need someone willing to be the Main Character of a story I put together. The details of said story, or rather a few stories you may choose from, we will discuss on Telegram OR Discord. I prefer to use Telegram since it is where my other roleplays are even though its an obscure messaging app and desktop application.

            "selftext": " Hey everyone! I'll make this short and to the point! The Secret Society is a roleplay about a world where a small percentage of humans are born with a power of some sort. The story begins with our character's signing up for a fighting tournament being held by those with powers; only those with powers may enter--mainly because their powers must stay hidden from the government/public. Our characters can know each other, but they don't have to.\n\nThe RP is meant to have more of a lighthearted beginning with a friendly (yet illegal) fighting tournament between those with powers, they are known as Oddities (Oddity singular). Slowly but surely the plot will become a descent into madness with much darker themes and all of that good jazz.\n\nThis may or may not be my last post regarding this specific RP. I just don't want to have too many RP's rolling at once so I may be a bit pickier about who I continue with! No hard feelings &lt;4\n\nWhat I'm looking for in a partner:\n\n* 18+ in age!\n* 2-3 responses per day, minimum. If real life is getting in the way of this just let me know and I'll understand.\n* Literacy! At least a paragraph per response unless the scene doesn't call for it.\n* Friendly OOC chat!\n* Able to flesh out a decent character. Also consider the drawbacks of having a particular power, if any. Makes the RP a lot more interesting if there's a personal struggle with one's power due to lack of training or just the nature of the power.\n\nThat's it, really! If you're interested just shoot me a DM and we can discuss things further! Thanks for reading.",

And this is one of those I\u2019d looove to have more than just the main pairing but a few mains and other things to progress the story. Here is the general idea ;p---\n\n\nSci fi! space adventures mixed with horror, gore, action, romance, humor, and fantasy!(i have an idea for this one regarding a desire for DRAGONS or dragon RIDERS as well that would be interesting or not its options)...be it earth and space entwining in secret until the politics keeping things hidden finally break free and innocent people are dragged into otherworldly trouble. Or space adventurous groups and gangs competing for power in the galaxies, a heist that was actually a war the lower group were not ready for brings out the true heroes of the universe. (this is open ended as well. Planet discovery gone far more dangerous than was listed? Or even select few humans being thrusted into accepting aliens exist and now have to help their \"friends\" save an entire world or rather...galaxy!? I have multiple characters for this is one with many different goals and desires. The main four I would love to use I have a link to view them here \u00a0--https://docs.google.com/document/d/10-WiMRZvmKaTnuhsI90yefmuKmbUDtxmixlz6wZimwg/ \u00a0\u00a0)\n\n\nSo hope to hear from somebody :3 I have discord, email, or DM on here.

            "selftext": " \n\nHello! I'm a professional artist who needs some inspiration, so I'd like to put my feelers out for a new roleplay partner; writing and getting invested in my characters leads me to draw more humans, which is what I'm currently trying to improve on.\n\nSome things about me: I'm 24, turning 25 soon, and I can reply basically every day/multiple times a day because I'm self-employed. I tend to get very emotionally invested in my characters and love writing all sorts of situations for them, so I'm hoping I can find someone just as passionate as myself to RP with!\n\nI have two characters off the bat that I'd have the most ease expanding upon, feel free to check out their profiles here -  [https://toyhou.se/strmct](https://toyhou.se/strmct) \n\nBecause of the nature of these guys, I'd say I'm looking for a Fallout: New Vegas or fantasy themed adventure! That being said, if you have a plot you think one of these dudes would enjoy (or I would enjoy making a character for) please go ahead and let me know!\n\nYou can see my criteria in my profile, but I'll go ahead and post it here as well for ease:\n\n\u2022 18+ partners only! I am uncomfortable with roleplaying with minors.\n\n\u2022 I write literate paragraphs in third person. I would really like to write with someone who does the same.\n\n\u2022 I am comfortable roleplaying adult/dark material but I don\u2019t want that to be the only thing we do!\n\n\u2022 You need to bring forth effort into the story; I don't want to just carry the story the entire time.\n\n\u2022 I'm looking for an active, reliable RP partner! If we end up being friends, that's even better.\n\n\u2022I roleplay through Discord only, usually by making a server for you and I to use privately!\n\nI think that's about it! If you have any questions or interest in roleplaying with me, please don't hesitate to shoot me a PM!",

            "selftext": "Welcome to Chiron\u2019s School for the Unique and Gifted! We are a small group currently of about five people who had an idea to make a school themed after the Olympians as teachers; with their Demi-God offsprings and such as their students. We decided after a couple months just roleplaying amongst ourselves and really putting the idea together to branch out and invite more people in. You can choose to play as one of the canonical Greek Gods, as a student, or even both! We don't have a limit on a number of characters (most of us have multiple).\n\nEach God is to teach a class on a certain day when we get a full roster up, which would be discussed what day is best for someone when they know they'll have time to roleplay. When not in a class, we're in a general Roleplay channel.  We're all a very friendly bunch, so I do have a bit of a vetting process as a small group. I have run a couple groups before, and the last thing I'll have happen is to allow bad juju inside!\n\nGeneral Rules: \n\n1) No Godmoding, please. Or \"Betty Sues\" as they call it. Not even One Punch Man is invincible and he's badass. \n\n2) You have to be over 18, there are adult themes in the group! No open smut or anything, but it's definitely got material your ma or pa might not like. \n\n3) This is strictly a Discord server group. It  has an RP category and an OOC category with channels organized in between. Biggest peeve for us is keeping OOC chat to the OOC category.\n\n4) If you decide to join up with us, please be friendly! To prove you read this, tell me your favorite color in your PM to me. Don't shy away to talk to us, we let in new people one at a time so we can give a proper welcome both OOC and IC. I\n\n5) Have fun! There is a generic profile template we have for characters but if you have something of your own that's acceptable and fitting to the theme you see when you join up, that's all fine and dandy! We're a really relaxed group, and many of us don't get much time to get on. It's not crazy active; so don't expect to see us post maybe a couple times a day during the week when we all work. Weekends are definitely a bit more active.",

I'd prefer to have my character be a anti-hero/villian paired against a hero.\n\n\nName: Sami O'Neal \n\nAge: 19\n\nHeight: 5'9\n\nAppearance: Pale skin and very dark hair. \u00a0\u00a0He has central heterochromia, so the center of his eyes are a light brown and the outsides are blue.\n\nAlias/Status: Phase, anti-hero, currently labeled villain. \n\nPowers: Phasing--able to change his form or an innate objects form to either solid, liquid, or gas\n\nPersonality: Sami is a bit of a narcissist. He loves himself more than anyone really should and really doesn't think he can do wrong. \u00a0But he does generally like being around other people. He loves to talk and be around people. Sometimes he'll even help as long as it's not too much of an inconvenience for himself. \u00a0Sami usually thinks and uses people more as entertainment than actual companions. He's a bit of a flirt and very playful. Sami doesn't take much seriously unless it's a slight against him. \u00a0Sami is stubborn when his ideas are challenged and doesn't like to be wrong.\n\nBio: Sami grew up in a military family, so he moved around all the time. \u00a0He never really had close friends since he didn't stay for very long in one place. \u00a0Even when he finally grew up and moved out on his own, Sami didn't stay in one place for long. \u00a0He often forgets to pay his bills, so gets kicked out. Doesnt go to class often and forgets assignments, \u00a0so he either drops or flunks out. School is boring, but he figures its essential, so Sami bounces from apartment to apartment and school to school in an attempt to complete. \u00a0But it doesn't take long before he grows bored and restless\n\nI'm wanting to pair him with a male thats a bit older, but I am open to all sorts of characters!",

Unfortunately i usually don't have time to do consistent chat-based games. This is a \u201csandbox\u201d hard sci fi RPG idea i've been developing for a while: A few words about the setting: it's a grand scale space opera style, with spaceships traveling between systems, establishing bases and doing the von Newman thing.. (more spaceships) \u00a0there is no known faster than light travel, no artificial gravity. \n\nEnergy produced mostly by fusion and antimatter catalysed fusion, so antimatter is extremely rare and expensive, big spaceships will have maybe a few grams on board. \n\nInterstellar propulsion made possible by fusion engines, and a combination of solar/laser sails which require megastructures in form of laser arrays at least in the outbound system and gravitational maneuvering, with possible bussard ramjets if the gas density in the region is very high. \n\nInterstellar ships is massive with large crew, with most of the crew in \u201ccold sleep\u201d anabiosis for most of the voyage. Voyages between even close stars take decades.\n\n\nOn the story: You will start as part of a reduced crew of an interstellar ship Red Star sent to investigate an outpost that went \u201cquiet\u201d unexpectedly. \n\n\nWhere the story takes us, the sky's the limit. Depending on a scale we wish to take it could be from individual adventure to massive scale with players controlling multiple ships and colonies. NSFW is fine if its in a scope of a game (and everyone involved is an adult) this is however mostly an adventure game not exclusively romance game. \n\n\nDepending on demand story can be lightharted, or cosmic horror, as for scale anything from spaceship crew members to galactic civilisations is game.",

            "selftext": "Hello, Im 21 years old, Male, currently living in a Central Standard Time zone, I am quite busy lately but I will be able to give at the very least one solid response a day.  Being roleplaying for a long while, I prefer 1st person but will do 3rd. Anyways, here is what I have in mind. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe massive engines tore gravel and peddles from the ground, sending them flying away in a fierce tornado of dust. The sky was dark, as it often was. Caal suffered from long nights and short days, approximately 3/4s of an Earth day equivalent was completely dark. The lack of sun brought its citizens skinny, pale, and sickly looks. The planet, however,  was blessed with near boundless amounts of a special steel allowed, whose name and use was unknown to most citizens of the Human Empire. With most of the Caal citizens being expected to work on the endless networks of mines, the lack of sun light wasn\u2019t a large concern to most.  \n\nThe ramp opened, hitting the dark ground with a loud thump. Six men walked out, clad in black armor, their faces hid behind their intimidating helmets. All the soldiers were taller and larger than a regular human, genetically modified when young to become the super soldiers they were chosen for. Every single one of them had been handpicked, implanted new organs to allow a genetic change in their bodies, they were taller and stronger than any human, they were trained for near a decade before being able to see combat and were clad in massive armored plates, completely invulnerable to common weaponry. They all carried a similar rifle and walked in perfect unison. It was these soldiers that had been responsible for wiping out hundreds of alien species for the bettering of humankind. Seeing one of these soldiers was a story that would be told for generations, the very ground they stepped in would be cherished and near worshipped. The Defenders of Mankind were honored throughout the stars. The six warriors made the gravel sink with every step as they walked towards a certain house structure ignoring the small crowd forming around them. They let themselves in as they were met with an older man, long white beard and a loose robe, his eyes and expression trembling with fear. The lead soldier removed his helmet, a handsome masculine face hiding underneath adorned by a few scars across his lower jaw, whatever could hurt one of these soldiers? What could truly kill one of them? It was unimaginable. \u201cCaptain Winters\u201d The soldier said, his voice deep and thunderous.  \n\n\u201cOf course\u201d the man whispered as he walked to the other corner of the room. There was a small family huddled on that corner,  a frail man and woman hugging a young woman, 20 Earth years? It was hard to tell an age due to their skinny and pale features.  \n\nIt made sense for them to be terrified, it wasn\u2019t unusual for those soldiers to visit planets even remote planets and leave with an individual, their fates were always left unknown to their families, many speculated that they were killed, others that they were chosen by Lords to do important work.  \n\nThe  captain took an electronic device from his pouch and approached the girl, he could feel the fear in her body as a needle slowly slid into her arm, after a green light appeared on the display he removed it. \u201cI am Alexander Winter Captain of the 2nd Company Terran Marines\u201d he spoke with a monotone voice as he offered her his hand. \u201cYou are required by the Laws of Earth to come with me.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDisclaimer: yes it is partly based in loose Warhammer 40,000 settings, however, It will be a completely different \"universe\". My idea is that the woman is chosen to serve a special role back on Earth, maybe she holds unique powers near unheard of except by the leaders of the human empire. The idea is that something goes extremely wrong, and they are attacked while on the way back, ends up stranded or something and the warriors are killed one by one until the girl and the captain are the only ones left. Anyways, nothing is set on stone, let me know If interested.",

I'm a long time roleplayer and novice writer - Roughly 7/8 years by now (although I know there are people here with twice that number of years under their belt).\n\nCurrently, I'm searching for a partner, that would be interested in a WW1 or WW2 themed, alternate-history scenario to roleplay in!\n\nI do have my own alt-history world that I've built up and can use as a setting - But I am also completely open to creating something from the ground up together!\n\nThe general plots/types of stories I'd be interested in doing, are basically open for discussion! War, slice-of-life, romance, ect. So long as it sounds good, and is set in that era of history, I'm down to give it a try! I myself prefer a more soldier-focused, military/war type of plot or story. But I know that's not everyone's jam, which is why I'm also open to discussing other ideas!\n\nIf you're interested in something along the lines I've listed above, then feel free to shoot me a message and hopefully, we can get something set up!",

It doesnt have to be exactly that but, I'd like the regular life, romance, drama type RP. I prefer 25+ characters. I should also add, this is a SFW rp.\n\nThe setting I kind of have in mind is we're all roommates. I'd love to come up with an idea with the group so everyone is happy.\n\nI'd prefer Discod mainly because it's easy to separate OOC and IC. I'm well organized. \n\nI'm a very causual person who is just wanting to have fun with a group of people. I'm okay with then not being book like posts but I'd prefer substance in them. Honestly whatever fits the situation. If its dialog and is a back and forth I understand that being shorter.\n\nIf this is something your into and would be interested in RPing with me just send me a message.\n\nThank you!",

As always you have no idea how they managed to smuggle it in there without you noticing.\n\nThe tidy handwriting on the small grey paper has the familiar tone to it. \n\n'On the hill of relief stands a monastery of grief.

Here are a few Infos :)\n\n- There is magic in the world, if you want your character to be capable of some let me know\n\n- The religion is somewhat oriented around Christianity but has some own twists\n\n- Please be 18+ for the play as it is possible to get into trouble.\n\n- Supernatural creature exist but are rare and most city folk haven't seen one.\n\n\n\nIf you have questions or are interested hit me up :)\n\nHave a fun day.",

            "selftext": "Hey there! As stated in the title, I\u2019m  looking to do a high fantasy medieval based rp. I\u2019ll summarise the plot here, but I won\u2019t go into too much detail. The basic idea of this rp is that a righteous character has to team up with one of the \u201cvillains\u201d the kingdom has locked up in solitary, purely because they have no other choice. \n\nThe basic idea of this is that Caelum, the deity of the heavens and sky, wants to cleanse the universe - reset it. Remake everything to his benefit. This would mean the complete extinction of everyone, including all the realms. \n\nYour character, trusted by the king of the kingdom of earth, has stepped up to stop Caelum, but she can\u2019t do it alone. The king takes her through passages of the castle she never even knew about, down to the darkest dungeons. Behind multiple corridors, chains, and bolted doors lies a prisoner forgotten about for years. Anemos - a son of Caelum. Half human, half deity. He\u2019s a troublemaker. There are many stories of him doing awful things to the kingdom and the realms. However, despite this, he\u2019s the only one who is able to help. He knows more about his father than anyone. Besides, the kingdom would be much better if he was to die out there anyway. \n\nAnemos and your character must venture out to fight of the deity that is Caelum, all whilst trying to keep Anemos under control. \n\nThere\u2019s a lot to this plot that I haven\u2019t written down here, but will be revealed in DMs if you\u2019re interested.\n\nI hope to hear from you soon!",

            "selftext": "Darkblood Manor\n\nIt's a cold fall night in the Eastern European countryside when you arrive at the house you've inherited from an uncle you've met maybe once. Four stories, completely isolated, and modernized according to the deed. Fitted with a full basement, many bedrooms and bathrooms, and a full staff. Not including a massive master bedroom.\n\nYou knew little of your Uncle Victor. Just that he kept to himself often, was always ready to leave a conversation, and was some sort of researcher. \n\nStanding outside, waiting for you on the grand front porch is a tall, rigid woman with pale skin, standing stiff as a board. \"Welcome to your new home, master... May I ask your name and take your bags?\" She says with an outstretched hand and a thick Ukrainian accent.\n\n-\n\nThe Drowned World\n\n100 years ago, the ocean's water level rose without explanation. The large majority of the world is underwater. The surviving members of the world, and their descendants, can't do anything but survive in the unforgiving world. It's been divided into several regions by the inhabitants.\n\nDivided into regions. Smokestack Harbor, Frozen North, Blistering South, Nao-Hi, The Outer Islands, and The Open.\n\nSmokestack Harbor is just a single island. Big port and good sized city. Has the largest civilian population.\n\nFrozen North has a few colonies spattered around. Barely habitable by anyone who wasn't born there. The landmasses are dotted with icy caves ripe for exploration and harvesting.\n\nThe South is similar, but worse. No colonies, but rumors. Hundreds of rumors regarding an ancient castle, angry gods, and priceless resources.\n\nNao-Hi is a huge center of industry, while also being a marauder and pirate safe haven. More or less run and operated by criminals. Sin and vice of all kinds are welcome and embraced.\n\nThe Outer Islands is a series of rafts that are anchored in place and connected by sturdy bridges. Big trade center, like Smokestack, with less of the regulations. \n\nThe Open is a general term used to describe the open sea, but also an area in itself. A massive expanse of open water that nobody has ever made it to the end of. If you don't run out of fuel or go mad, hunger and dehydration will take you for sure.\n\n-\n\nRoad \ud83d\udc4f Trip \ud83d\udc4f\n\nYour bags are packed, the RV is gassed up and ready. Stocked with food, water, built in generator, and/or all the booze and drugs a young, free soul would need. Time to start your journey, and get out the road to drive and conquer!\n\n(It can take place during the modern day, or it can take place in the past, where \"Sex, drugs, and rock and roll\" mentality was more prevalent. Semi-fantasy too, if you want!)\n\n-\n\nThat's all the juicy ones. If any caught your eye or your interest, feel free to PM me, and I'll get back to you as soon as I can!",

            "selftext": "A little over 22 years ago, a great pirate owned the sea, living life to its fullest as he and his crew did whatever they wanted and whenever they wanted. This all stopped when the World Government\u2019s Marines came along, capturing the Pirate King and sentencing him to death. However, just before he died the Pirate King spoke his last words, screaming them to the Heavens, telling all that he had hid his treasure, the One Piece, at the end of the Grand Line, and encouraged all to seek it out.\n\nThis has sparked the interest of many a generation, encouraging people to go out and become pirates to claim riches for themselves, creating \u2018The Great Pirate Age\u2019.\n\nSo for those of you who don\u2019t know, this roleplay is inspired by One Piece, the popular manga/anime of the same name, however you don\u2019t need to know anything about One Piece.\n\nNow what am I looking for? Well I\u2019m hoping to find a partner that wants to sail the seas with me as a pirate, adventuring from island to island, raising our bounties as we go and forming a mighty crew. More details can be discussed over messages.\n\nNow for writing style, I am pretty easy on this, I don\u2019t mind if we roleplay 1st or 3rd person and I don\u2019t mind about your post length as long as I\u2019m able to reply to it.\n\nI hope this post has interested you and if so please shoot me a message.",

I'd also like to focus on his younger years, before and possibly during his prime. Would love to have a lot of angst, if you're into that, too. \n\nI use past tense, 3rd person, details, Discord only and I can reply at the very least once a day. I know life's more important, but if you are going to be gone for a lengthy period of time, I'd like to know. I'd also like to know if the roleplay isn't to your liking. Don't just ghost people, that's rude.\n\nAnyway! You can play as any canon character (that was alive back then) and you could possibly play as the GM or you can play as an OC and them and Yagi can develop a bond or friendship. (No NSFW though)\n\nWhat I also ask of you is that you're under 30 years of age, as I myself am a minor. If you're not comfortable with that, then this ad's not for you.\n\nThis is about it. For the plot, you can shoot me a message and we can discuss it more. Thanks for reading my ad! Have a plus ultra day!",

I love to  write it and be detailed - but at best combined with world building and  plot development!

I would like my partner to use 3rd person and be a literate. I can and usually do answer multiple times a day and am usually always available since it\u2019s summer break and I\u2019m a student. I don\u2019t usually write long paragraphs but can do more paragraphs if I\u2019m really into the Roleplay. A few ideas I have are:\n\n\u2022 A princess who\u2019s run away to live in the woods after her father basically had her mother killed. She realizes that her father is getting old and that there is no heir so she wants to kill the king and reappear to take over the kingdom. She would need a companion to help her achieve this someone who she is connected to via her dreams.\n\n\u2022 Vampires. I would like them to jump between time periods. This idea is a little bit more vague and unfinished and I would love to develop it with someone.\n\n\u2022I am also open to any ideas you may have or are hankering to do. I can do NSFW stuff but would prefer it to not be the WHOLE plot. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in this please message me on here and we can exchange Discord/Kik usernames.

            "selftext": "Hullo!\n\nI'm Leila, I'm in my twenties (and would prefer to roleplay with people around my age or at least 18+) and I had been roleplaying for over ten years until the well dried up when AIM died and Neopets got stricter and more annoying.\n\nHowever, I've been writing short stories consistently during/since that time, so I've been keeping myself in the habit. It would be nice if you introduced yourself with your name and such little details so I don't feel like I'm roleplaying with a robot - OOC chat is okay and is even something I'd consider vital to start with!\n\nBasically, I would like (almost) any type of modern roleplay with many pairings considered, if that's your bag rather than situations.\n\nIt's really that simple :3\n\nI expect each other to respond in kind in regards to things like length, so it doesn't matter if it's two sentences or five paragraphs - I will aim to reply in the same way.\n\nChuck pairings at me! Most 'realistic' modern scenes fall under what I would do - highschool, roommates, band members, brothers-in-arms, drug addict x dealer, anything else you can think of that isn't fantasy based, basically.\n\nPlease PM me here to get started :3 I'm on my laptop all day and some of the night (GMT timezone) so I'll always be around and will normally respond quickly. However, I know many people do have these things I think they call 'ly-ives', so I understand if you can only reply occasionally, though I won't deny that at least one post a day would be appreciated :3",

I'm cool with sticking to the story or doing some AU stuff. A little slice of life and fluff is always fun too. \n\nI'm down for any post length. But I write 3rd person on discord. I could be persuaded to Kik. \n\nI like OCxCanon, canonxcanon depending on the characters. I'm always willing to double up story lines! Everyone should be happy and get who they want. \n\nSo characters I'm looking for my partner to play:\n\nSmallMight (Toshinori Yagi)\n\nPresent Mic (Hizashi Yamada)!!!\n\nTenya Iida\n\nAizawa (Eraser Head)\n\nTetsutetsu Tetsutetsu\n\nEijiro Kirishima \n\nI'm down to try playing just about anyone for my partner. \n\nI'm open to other options and suggestions however as I'm really digging this anime right now.

            "selftext": "Hi all, I'm a female older than 18 looking for another adult to role-play with. I love to role-play and I'm looking to get more interesting partners to play with. I have very few boundaries and will play most roles. I'm mostly interested in romance but can work with whatever you want. Just let me know what you want and I will try to get it going! I don\u2019t care if you are male or female. These are a few ideas that I have typed out, but we don't have to do them. I will rp in first or third person. These are NSFW themes, but I like slow burns.  I prefer role-playing on discord, but I might make an exception if you seem worth it. If you don't like my prompts, then I'd be more than willing to read your ideas. Just PM me and we can talk about what we want to do!\n\nIt is late at night and trouble happened at the bar I work at. The last two customers are very drunk and try to take me as theirs. Instead a group of unknown men beat them up and leave without allowing me to thank them. You are part of this group. Little did I know that this was a group of pirates. The two men wake and I run and hide in a barrel at the ports. Suddenly the barrel is moved and taken on board of your pirate ship. I hit my head when it is being moved and don\u2019t wake until the following night when the groups of pirates are drinking at a party and they open it to find me. \n\nI am princess of the fox-demons. I am in a cabin blood is surrounding me and all of it is my own. My clothing is ripped up and I look to have been stabbed multiple times in various places. I\u2019m weak and can barely stay awake. I thought the hunters left me to die but then footsteps sounded, I look up to see a dark silhouette in the door.  \n\nYour army is raiding my town at midnight. As you ride through the streets, you kill people left and right. You are allowed to take whatever you want. You make it to my house and burst past the door. It\u2019s obvious by the small size of the home that the occupants are poor. You walk through my house silently. When you come to my room you see me sleeping deeply on the small bed. One thin blanket covers my shivering body, the room cold from the nights freezing air blowing through the partially open window. Next to me is a little boy about three years old, wrapped in several blankets as he sleeps peacefully. \n\nI love settings of any day. Old, new, magic, supernatural? Let's do it! Vampires, witches, superheros, I'm open to most anything. I just ask you to be semi-literate. My list of likes and dislikes are on my profile.\nI hope to hear from you soon!",

I\u2019d probably reach out faster as well) I hope you all are having a great day and want to start out by saying thank you for checking out my post! I\u2019m looking for an 18+ male. Mostly because I like to have adult themes in my Roleplay to allow from some conflict and tension.\n\nSo just to start out with, here are some Genres I\u2019m into doing (just I heads up I don\u2019t do fandoms)\n\n-Fantasy (All Kinds)\n\n-Superhero \n\n-Mystery\n\n-Slice of Life (if it has a really developed story)\n\nAnd there is one genre I won\u2019t do and that is Post Apoc. It\u2019s not my favorite and most likely won\u2019t do it.\n\nSome other things you should know is I am an artist so I usually draw most of my face claims, however I don\u2019t require you to have any face claims, descriptions are fine with me.\n\nResponses should be a paragraph or more. I tend to get lengthy with my responses which can be really fun if the partner is doing that as well!\n\nI am usually on 24/7 most of the time (PST.) However I only require my partners to at least post once a day, and if something comes up in life? Don\u2019t worry about it, just don\u2019t forget to tell me.\n\nLastly I just want to thank you again for reading! As I said I do like using discord, so send me a reply, and don\u2019t be shy! Put your discord on there as well so we can get talking right away! (You will probably get responses right away if you include a small bit about yourself and what you\u2019re into, as well as your discord. Bye! Have a great day!)",

Whether it\u2019s with pre-existing OCs or characters we develop together, I want to build stories with realistic, authentic characters and plots. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they have to be in realistic or modern settings; I\u2019m all about fantasy, historical, sci-fi, or anything else we can come up with. \n\nYour gender doesn\u2019t matter, nor do the gender identities of any characters you play. I have a slight preference for MxM ships, but I\u2019m happy to do FxF, MxF, as well as any combination of nonbinary characters mixed in. Of course, romance isn\u2019t a need, but I do enjoy having a romantic subplot, or even main plot. NSFW is also welcome. \n\nI\u2019m open to a wide variety of scenes and settings, whether it be modern, steampunk, superheroes, medieval, high fantasy, urban fantasy, historical, you name it. I love discussing plots and developing characters with people. Discord is preferred, so if you\u2019re interested, please PM me or comment on this post!",

            "selftext": "Hello! As the title states, I'm looking for a partner to do something with mechs, big robots, whatever you wanna call them. Specifically, the eastern style. Stuff like Gundam, Macross, Code Geass, etc.\n\nBefore I get into that, a little about me. I've got a decade of roleplaying under my belt and personal writing for just as long. I'm in my early-mid twenties so I'd appreciate if anybody that took an interest was at least 18+, in case of adult contents yet to be named. I also like people who tend to be a little more chatty OOC. I find it more fun to form friendships out of it than just someone to write with and never talk. Keeps things interesting. My availability is open most of the day, and if something comes up, I'll tell you. I only use Discord because I find it the most convenient, and I'm not looking to use anything else.\n\nWith that out of the way, I didn't exactly have plot builds to put up, or nothing set in stone, I should say, but I have some skeleton ideas to build around.\n\nMacross: Part of a group of SMS military contractors sent out to the galactic rim around the Orion Arm of the galaxy, investigating something or another. Set up can be both characters are pilots, one pilot and a mechanic/bridge crew/etc.\n\nGundam: Particularly the G Gundam timeline or the Gundam Build Fighters timeline, since I've enjoyed both.\n\nG Gundam: Characters would be working as a Gundam Fighter/Handler team during the 14th Gundam Fight. Memories of the Dark Gundam are still fresh and cleanup is barely started. Possibly a resurgence of the Dark Gundam, unknown yet.\n\nGundam Build Fighters: Something more slice of life. Built around building the Gunpla figures and battling it out with whatever gets made. A little bit more open with where it could progress, and I think simpler because while it has an anime counterpart, it's not needed really.\n\nCode Geass: Probably taking place during the end of Season 1, war is breaking out all over the place and could follow the Black Knights or either side of the war between the Britannian Empire or Europia United.\n\nAs I said before, these are bare bones ideas that I'm more than willing to alter with a partner's input, but it's what I've got for now. If you have something else in mind, another series perhaps, my ears are open.",

Well's original novel but with a few twists (including a reversal of the central idea) and a modern setting. Design your own \nhuman character, and see how they thrive and struggle against a mad doctor and his genetic experimentation on a remote Pacific island. Needless to say, lots of changes are coming. \n\nDuke it out with Epoch Pharmaceuticals' gallery of unstable scientists and scheming corporate elements. Forge new friendships and rivalries with the other islanders. Prepare yourself for an eventual final confrontation with Doctor Moreau himself.

            "selftext": "\n\nHeathcliffe Heights is a small, dreary town in upstate New York that was known more for being rainy than it is for literally anything else. It consisted of a small downtown area with multiple shops and a few outdated  places for entertainment, 3 schools, a middle class suburb, a smaller, more upper class neighborhood further up the hill that the town was built around, and a more rural area that had old graveyards, churches, and a lake.\n\nThe DeWinters had just moved into one of the houses on Belial Lane, the row of upper middle to high class houses that looked down on the small town of Heathcliffe Heights. Dante DeWinter looked out of the window of his parent\u2019s black SUV as they pulled into the driveway of their new home. It was a large, Victorian era house mostly surrounded by trees save for the front. His family valued their privacy, so that was a big plus. \u201cIt seems we\u2019ve arrived. The furniture is already here so let\u2019s go ahead and bring our own things up.\u201d Dante\u2019s father, Caine said as he turned off the SUV and got out. Dante let out a small sigh, his breath fogging the glass of the window a little before he got out as well. The fresh fall wind tugged at his denim jacket as he stepped onto the gravel of the driveway. \u201cThis blows. We should\u2019ve stayed in Washington.\u201d Those words, accompanied by a huff came from the other side of the SUV from Circe, Dante\u2019s sister. Four years younger than him and going through the rebellious teen girl phase, she was a handful. \u201cLanguage, Circe. You\u2019ve yet to give the place a chance. Give it time before you jump to judgement.\u201d Smooth words from Minerva, Dante\u2019s mother. \n\nIt took him time to bring all of his things up to his room at the end of the hall on the second floor. It was a decent size with enough space to fit the various things he liked to collect. Though, he could already hear the faint sound of melodramatic music coming from his sister\u2019s room two doors down, Dante was fairly happy with his personal space. He walked over to the one window of the room, sitting down in the windowsill. The view of the town below was perfect, and he could even see Wayne Polk High School where he would be attending for his final year of high school. \u201cUgh..\u201d he wasn\u2019t too happy about that. Especially since he didn\u2019t need to attend school. Why would he need to go to school to gain useless knowledge? Dante had basically eternity to learn things.. He and his family were vampires after all.\n\nHey! I\u2019ve been recently inspired to try a romantic RP with gothic, supernatural elements and I\u2019d like one of you to join me in creating a longterm story with many different themes! This RP is very opened ended as far as plot and direction go! If you have any ideas about anything, I\u2019d love to hear as I\u2019m not looking to carry the entire story on my own. If possible, I\u2019d love to do a Vampire x Human pairing, but you\u2019re not limited to that. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested, message me on Reddit.\n\nI\u2019m more likely to respond if you tell me what your favorite movie, tv show, or video game is. Hope to see you there.",

I don\u2019t mind asking but I will only ask once, where have you been, before I delete/leave the server. Everyone has a life and other very important things to do I get that so please just let me know. \n\n-respect my needs. I\u2019ve been doing this since I was 13 so please understand that I have a style and a form of writing. If I feel that our styles will not mesh I will be asking you to change or it\u2019s not going to work. I know it\u2019s kind of rough to say that but I rp because it\u2019s fun, and having to decipher someone else writing or having myself pulled out of the story because our styles don\u2019t work together just isn\u2019t what I want. \n\n-Let me know of concerns or problems. Every Rp I do had an OOC channel for that very reason. Voice your concerns please. \n\n-understand that I have a rather hectic life. And posting everyday sometimes just isn\u2019t possible. I post a minimal of three times a week when my schedule is light but that can reduce to once a week if things get really crazy. \n\n\n\n*What I\u2019m looking for in my Rp*\n\n-grammar doesn\u2019t have to be perfect and neither does spelling. As long as I can read it we should be fine. \n\n-I have no post length. But I need enough to work with. One liners don\u2019t just magically work all the time. \n\n-details are my crack so please be descriptive if you can. \n\n-romance, adventure and drama are all musts. \n\n-I don\u2019t to spin off of shows or anything like that originals only. Setting are alright though. Like the fallout universe for example works for me. \n\n-currently I\u2019m drawing a blank with any specific plots that I\u2019m looking for so please message me with your ideas.",

            "selftext": "*The wood beneath your feet groans as the ship's bow pitches and lists with the water's ebb and flow. Black sails billow aloft in a powerful northwester, marring the crispness of the clear blue skies. The rough grunts and shouts of the crewmen, accompanied by a mellifluent sea shanty and faint cries of overhead seagulls, ring in your ears. A pungent odor of salt and sweat wafts up to your nose. From where you stand in the quarter-deck, a shimmering, golden sea stretches to the horizon.*\n\n*The Caribbean, 1689.*\n\nWhere will you adventure? To the northeast lies Tortuga, the last bastion of piracy in the Caribbean waters, haven to the buccaneers. And even further north stands proud His Majesty's Port Royal, a truly dangerous place for all pirate-folk. In the deep swamps of Cuba and Haiti menace a band of mystics and shamans, guarding ancient secrets that only rumors speak of. To the south lie the Lesser Antilles, a string of keys and islands home to vicious man-eating cannibals, ready to ravish and feast upon the unsuspecting stranger. \n\nJourney as you wish! Naval encounters with enemy ships, pillaging and looting, romancing, treasure quests, battles with mystical creatures, struggling for control as the Pirate King or Queen, singing sailor songs, exploring uncharted terrain in the West Indies and even elsewhere! \n\n*In the Caribbean, there is no lack of adventure.* \n\n***\n\nHello, all! As a pirate lore/fiction/history aficionado, I've been hankering for a well-written swashbuckling tale. This will be a role-play set in the Caribbean in the late 1600s to the early 1700s. It will be mostly historical although with some leeway and minor fantasy elements will be included. A knowledge of history isn't required, but a general sense of creativity would be well-appreciated. This will be a very plot-heavy and character-driven role-play, with choices that will decide what and where your character will be and how the story will unfold. If you would prefer, however, the RP can lean more NSFW-heavy. \n\nWho you play is up to you, and the story will depend on what character you choose. You can be a simple barmaid/cabin boy who gets caught up in a maritime adventure with pirates, perhaps kidnapped or willingly shanghaied to rise through the ranks and become captain. Or you can start off as a captain and begin your adventure from there. The choice is yours! I am always open to brainstorming new stories for fresh characters. \n\nNOTE: Please be literate and able to write at least a paragraph-length reply. I try to put in a fair amount of detail into fleshing out the world and characters so it kinda sucks to receive one-liners in response.",

Im currently looking to so a long term superhero/vigilante roleplay the story will center around your character being recruited to join a team of heroes of various ages and backgrounds, and slowly becoming the greatest heroes the world has ever seen.\n\nIve done many roleplays in the past, hut this is one I'm particularly excited for, as i love superheroes/mythology. I love building a universe and building lore for for it, and i especially love stories about people rising up to do good in a world where people tell them that they cant.\n\nSo what can you expect from this roleplay? Action, drama, romance, and much more. As the GM I will he playing multiple characters, all of whom will be unique and interesting, and I'm not just talking about powers. Ill be taking lots of inspiration from other comics, and I will do my best to keep you hooked. \n\nThe stories will be divided into chapters, each chapter will focus on character development; characters will die, and others will be introduced, and the villains will test the heroes in ways you cant even imagine.\n\nIm purposefully being a little vague here... for more details, dm me! I can roleplay on discord or kik, and i look forward to hearing from you soon! If you text me please describe your characters powers and a short description of them fighting crime or saving someone.",

While I do have a crude idea for a scenario starter, my general hankering is for anything from the franchise - we can sort out multiversal shenanigans over PMs/Discord if required. What I'd be looking for ideally is someone to play Seymour or a Seymour-like character for whom my OC works under/is deftly manipulated by to do their dirty work. Romance isn't out of the question, nor is establishing some long running rivalry - neither are necessary to the roleplay itself, but do add some good story drama if played well. As an adult, I'm cool with NSFW material, so long as it has background basis.\n\nIf whatever you had in mind doesn't fit the above, no worries - my best (sole) quality is flexibility; sometimes the unexpected can be more thrilling than having everything tailored to one's taste.\\~",

            "selftext": "Hi! I've been wanting to do a Jojo's Bizarre Adventure RP for awhile. However, I am not really interested in playing as a canon character or as Speedwagon's surprise grandson or something, so I would rather have a more original, non-canon scenario. Particularly, I am interested in exploring what it would be like for a Stand user to exist in a more realistic setting. Here are two scenarios I've devised thus far.\n\nScenario A:\n\nCrime is on the rise throughout Europe and the Americas. However, these crimes are being committed through strange and exotic ways that are seemingly more out of a comic book than a case file. Walls with gaping holes, scorch marks littering the ground, even reports of people flying away. In response, Interpol has ordered Agent (your OC here) and Agent (my OC here) to investigate these crimes and determine if there is a pattern. Little do the agents realize that they are about to enter a world where the rules do not apply, people can use strange and bizzare powers, and where a certain arrow has marked them both...\n\nOn the first sting, their task force is almost wiped out. In a desperate shoot out, Agent A gets locked in a desperate struggle with someone almost supernaturally strong. Agent B likewise is hounded by a criminal who seems to be in two places at once. They are both pierced by two arrows, and they fall unconscious...\n\nScenario B:\n\nA small town lies in the sleepy hills of the Great Plains. Char A has recently returned from college on a break. Char B currently works with their parents at the local inn. One day, a meteor falls into the woods outside of town. Both Char A &amp; Char B go out to see it. They meet each other at the landing site, vaguely recalling each other from high school. However, they both fall unconscious in the woods. When they wake up, they are stalked by strange creatures that are only visible to them. Worse, some nefarious individuals have rolled into town, seeking to claim the meteor for themselves...\n\nIf you have something similar to suggest, feel free and I might just say yes!\n\nNo matter which direction we take it in, there are 3 things that would (possibly) carry over into our plot:\n\nStand arrows exist, but they are scattered across the world. They function the same way as in canon.\n\nStone masks may or may not exist depending on how we steer the RP.\n\nThe Ripple or Spin may exist. I'm flexible as to which one we could use. Or we could just not use either.\n\nAbout me: I've been roleplaying for about two years now. I am in my 20's and live on the east coast (so EST). I would also prefer my partner be 20-30. I am usually active in the afternoon/evenings and always try to give at least one response per day. I usually will do 3-7 sentences. Anything more and I repeat myself or just give \"hot air.\" I don't really care about face claims.\n\nPlatform: Discord/Reddit PM\n\nRomance: I only do straight MxF romance. I do NOT do NSFW.",

            "selftext": "Hey! I'm looking to do an rp set in a world that's transitioning from medieval times to a steampunk-esque renaissance.\n\nWhat I mean by this is most places will still have standard medieval lives and businesses, but the more influential cities will have scholars and magitech engineers who combine magic, gunpowder, steam, and whatever else is at hand to produce the magitech that's carrying them into the next age.\n\nI'd like it to be at the beginning of the transitional age, so the modern cities would have gas lamps and the larger buildings would even have gas cookers and plumbing, but the outskirts, slums etc. would still be using traditional candles, wooden baths they manually fill etc.\n\nThis allows for the world's technology to be grown as part of our rp, and gives us more of an impact culturally as well.\n\nFor the weaponry, it would be a hybrid between classic swords, knives, lances etc. and somewhat traditional gunpowder pistols and rifles which can fire no more than a few shots before reloading.\n\nThis is just a basis of what elements I'd like and the sort of setting I'm after - we can go into more detail if you're interested so far.\n\nI'm looking for long term and whilst I'm happy to include NSFW elements, this is NOT what I want to be focusing on.\n\nIf you're interested, send me a pm and we can go from there - hope to hear from you soon! ^.^",

            "selftext": "They don't necessarily have to be ridden, but I've been really in the mood to roleplay people raising and training dragons lately! Before I get into that, here's a bit about me and how I roleplay so you can decide if you're interested:\n\n* As stated in the title, I'd like for it to be on discord. I've tried other places but I've found that discord works best for me!\n* I'm almost 26 and I have a full time job as well as two side jobs, so I can't reply all the time, but I do try my hardest to keep people from waiting for replies. \n* I do love a good plot line but generally my roleplays tend to be pretty slice-of-life based. We can definitely set up an over-arching plot line and discuss things like world building, but I'd like for things to be a little more casual in the beginning to really build up the characters.\n* I write in third person and past tense, in prose-style writing. I'd prefer it if you did as well!\n* I tend to write a lot for introductions but settle into 1-3 paragraphs for actual roleplay. I find that when I'm asked to do more than 3 paragraphs it becomes a bit annoying to react to everything that's been written and I tend to be more likely to lose interest in roleplays that way. \n* I like using face claims but don't really need you to use one as well. \n\nIn terms of the roleplay, I'm pretty open to discussion on what the characters are doing and where they're starting. When I first started thinking of this I thought that our characters would find/be presented with dragon eggs and would have to work together to figure out what it means and what to do with these creatures once they're born. A million years ago on Neopets there were a lot of these kinds of roleplays that had dragon riding academies which could be interesting as well, but those were extremely popular and I'm sure anyone who's interested in this has already done a ton of those haha. \n\nAlternatively, it could be that our plucky adventurers stumble on a dragon's nest and find the dragon's already dead and gone but her clutch was left behind. Maybe the eggs have already begun hatching or the hatchlings have been born and they imprint on our characters. Regardless of what state these little ones are found in, our characters are too soft hearted to leave them to die.\n\nMaybe we have characters who are each gifted a dragon egg on their (whatever age) birthday. Maybe they're royalty or of a noble house that is traditionally given this honor and our characters work together to raise their charges. (Please note: I literally could not care less about Game of Thrones, so I don't intend on having any Targaryen junk in this.)\n\nI like a little romance in my roleplays but don't necessarily need it. If it is included we certainly don't have to have our characters immediately fall into each other (where's the fun in that??) so we don't need to worry too much about it. If we do romance, I prefer F/F but am also comfortable writing F/M if the characters actually fit together. I would say that I'd do M/M but I like to play female as my main character when I roleplay (perfectly happy to do M/M side characters if you really want to include that kind of pairing though!!). \n\nI feel like I'm starting to ramble here so I'm going to wrap it up now. If any of this caught your eye--or even if you have an idea in this theme that I haven't mentioned above--please get in contact with me! I've been thinking about this for weeks now and finally decided to post something, so I'm more than eager to get someone interested in this!",

So I\u2019m I\u2019m the hunt for another partner or two who\u2019s really into medieval fantasy roleplaying!\n\nI enjoy story\u2019s that revolve around some sort of adventure, and this can take the form of a lot of things. Perhaps the story will revolve around solving a magical mystery in a foreboding city, or maybe it can take the form of a more traditional story akin to Lord of the Rings. Along with that I very much enjoy more thought out, and more \u201chuman\u201d characters. I don\u2019t mean that I want the characters to be racially human, but I want them to feel real and have actual strengths, weaknesses, wants and desires.\n\nI very much enjoy romance, although it isn\u2019t necessary, and NSFW stuff is great if it fits the scenario. That being said I like it when romance feels somewhat natural, and doesn\u2019t just happen because one of us wants it to happen and we somehow shoehorn it into the story.\n\nI live in the Eastern United States, so people in my time zone would be the best! But that really doesn\u2019t matter because I\u2019m sure we could accommodate. I think that\u2019s everything, so if I sound like someone you could work with please let me know!",

            "selftext": "Hey there! So I'm looking for something a little more specific than normal. Below is a prompt I wrote up today as I look to fill an open partner slot for a more futuristic story. While I love writing other genres and story ideas, below is what I'm looking for right now.   \n\n\nAbout me: I'm 30 and have been writing for the better half of my life in various forms from stories to tabletop campaign adventures to more recently RP. More personal writing focus is on character exploration and development over time and the ways events shape a character's decisions. I'm at my best writing multiple paragraphs and sometimes more depending on the scene and whats going on. Schedule-wise I primarily write my responses in my downtime during the day and typically try to respond multiple times when possible. During the weekend it's harder as that's my time with my family going out and doing stuff but you will always know in advance if I'll be absent for extended periods of time.  \n\n\nWhat I look for:\n\n\u2660 18+ / 21+ Preferred (due to content and possible NSFW elements if story fits)\n\n\u2660 Help pushing the story forward. Keep me on my toes, and I'll return the fun! Rock the boat!\n\n\u2660 Be able to write \\*at least\\* 1-2 paragraphs, more when the scene calls for it. \n\n\u2660 Specifically for this prompt, don't have an \"Invincible\" complex when coming up with stuff. We're good, but not Gods. \n\n\u2660 If romance is to be involved (and it doesn't have to be) than I only do MxF pairings. No disrespect to the others but I'm only comfortable writing what I know in that regard. However, story \\*\\*must\\*\\* fit for anything like that to happen. \n\n\u2660 Questions? Ask! Ideas? Throw them out! Work together with me!\n\n\u2660 If you want a writing sample from something besides the below prompt feel free to ask. I have quite a few! \n\n\u2660 Final note: if the below does not interest you I understand and feel free to message me anyway just know due to my schedule and free time I only keep so many RP's open / active to maintain frequent posts on my part. \n\n \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n\\*The year was 2173. Science had reached a new pinnacle of advancement, an era greater than the late 20th and 21st century. Initiated by the mega corporation \\*ADVOtech\\*, advancements in medicine fueled the company\u2019s rise from a start-up to the leader globally in all things related to technology and sciences while branching out less widely advertised into military weapons and projects.\\*\n\n\\*ADVOtech\u2019s CEO and Founder, Grant Hughes, would go on to become one of the most powerful people worldwide. Beyond just founding the company, the man was a genius developing the science behind Gene Therapy Clinics. These clinics made it possible to alter or enhance specific genes within a person allowing medical breakthroughs previously thought to be science fiction.\\*\n\n\\*Commercially, the clinics were built to help people recover from disorders or injuries from simply fixing poor eyesight or blindness to complete recover from spinal cord injuries and paralysis to even brain function recovery. Such medical breakthroughs, however, were expensive and put the company in danger of failing. Insurance refused to cover the experimental treatment and banks considered the risk to great to grant loans to those in need.\\*\n\n\\*Determined to see his work used for the good of people, Grant caved and began offering the treatments privately and without public knowledge. However, when the first wave of applicants came from the US Government an attack occurred on the secret site destroying it. The chemical used for the military version of Gene Therapy was stolen by an unknown group and Grant Hughes was missing.\\* \n\n\\*This led to the collapse of ADVOtech and any thought of Gene Therapy saving the world from illness and disease. With it\u2019s fall, the world gave up on such thoughts with governments around the world banning any and all research into it again. What wasn\u2019t known, however, was who stole the last of the serum and what it was being used for.\\*\n\n\\*That is, until now\u2026\\*\n\n\\*The year is 2180. There has been an alarming increase in unexplainable attacks all over the world. People or creatures with abilities or powers not natural to the world attacking people and places indiscriminately. That\u2019s when you got the letter.\\*\n\n\\*It came in a nondescript envelope with no return address. It wasn\u2019t even delivered by the usual delivery service but rather seemed to have been placed carefully under your door, out of local sight. Upon opening the letter it read:\\*\n\n\\*\u201cCongratulations! This is your acceptance letter into WASP, the Weapons and Advanced Soldiers Project. Your skill and reputation (both known and unknown) have made you an ideal candidate to aid the world in tracking down a new and rising threat.

I responded to a request here a little while ago and though things didn't work out with that individual, I'm curious to see if anyone would be interested in a roleplay with lil' ol' me!\n\nI'm a very relaxed type of person and although I consider myself to be a semi-advanced or advanced roleplayer based on years of experience &amp; literacy, I'm not looking to challenge myself per se. I want something that's the RP equivalent of bacon jalapeno mac n' cheese: meaty, spicy, cheesy, and comforting above all. I really want some amazing plots and complex characters from y'all! Let's build a plot together as we go along, OOC, or plot it out from the start - it's all good for me.\n\nI'm not into anime/manga/animated series, sci fi, fantasy, or supernatural, basically all fandoms ...I enjoy these in real life but not for roleplaying. In fact, I'm looking for anything in the wide wide world of 'slice of life'. My ideal genre is something relating to music (think: day to day life of a touring band, or a band in the process of recording music) but I'm open to all ideas. Romance will play heavily in any roleplay, even if it's slow burn or starts off with enemies, etc. If you're into cuddling, bickering, teasing, passionate exchanges and situations that will put the relationship to the test, I'm your gal! World building is wonderful and I love inserting small OCs where needed (kooky best friend, overbearing neighbor, etc). I also am the world's least serious person so I love ridiculous situations as well!\n\nI definitely require my partner and their characters to be 21+ since adult situations and language will be used, and also it's weird at my age (older millenial) to be roleplaying with people in their teens. NSFW friendly of course!\n\nI prefer to roleplay in FxM situations but will happily double for my partner in anything but FxF just because I'm terrible at it and it would only disappoint, lol. I expect my partner to match the length of my posts as much as reasonably possible - I can write one solid 7-8 sentence paragraph, to 5 paragraphs for a reply depending on what's going on in the roleplay and how much time I have. If you give me 5 replies in a row that are 3 sentences, I'm going to cut my replies way down to match it. I love to chat and discuss OOC so please feel free to hit me up if something crosses your mind! I don't bite unless you pay me. ;)\n\nI prefer to use Discord to keep OOC and IC stuff neat and tidy, but please send me a PM if you're interested or have a juicy plot idea to throw my way!",

And yes, Divergent, as in the book series turned movie series by Veronica Roth.\n\nShe\u2019s over 5 years old, so her overall concept is a bit rough, and I\u2019d really like to do an RP with someone in order to get a feel for her again and develop her more!\n\nI am currently searching for someone who is willing to do a medium to long-term roleplay as Eric!\n\nWhen I created Rose (my OC), I initially planned to partner her with Eric to see what I could come up with. I\u2019d like to try that in an RP format!\n\nA few things to consider:\n\n* I\u2019m a literate to semi-literate roleplayer, meaning all of my posts are at least 3-4 well-constructed sentences! I\u2019ve been roleplaying for almost 11 years, so 3-4 is usually on one of my low muse days. Either way, I\u2019m looking for someone who can do the same! All roleplayers know detail is key!\n* I\u2019d prefer to RP with someone who is ok with smut in case a scene comes up! If you\u2019re truly uncomfortable with it, I understand though!\n* I usually RP on Discord or Telegram! DO NOT share those on here, PMs only!\n\nSimply reply to this or PM me if interested and we can come up with something! Thank you!",

I need a partner who understands that I\u2019m not going to be able to reply back to back, who doesn\u2019t mind waiting a bit between responses. That being said, if I\u2019m available I\u2019ll get the response to you as soon as a I can, I just don\u2019t want someone to be breathing down my neck for a response.\n\nNow that that\u2019s out of the way, when I write I do so I\u2019m 3rd person, paragraph style, preferably over discord or email.\nWhen I say paragraph style, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not going to write you a book each time, I just write enough to give a good picture of what is going on, and make sure I give you something to work off of when you reply.\n\nOkay now we get to the fun part! There\u2019s a few things I have in mind for right now, and I\u2019m always open to hearing your ideas.\n\n1. Mafia Boss Arranged Marriage: young mafia boss (age 28 - 35) recently took over after his father was killed. To start off his takeover on a strong note and show he demanded the same amount of respect his father had, the young boss went around to collect on all the debts that were owed to his family. One man had such great debt that he was unable to pay, but had a daughter (age 26 - 30). He man offered his daughter\u2019s hand in marriage to settle the debt and after much pressure from his mother, the young boss agreed. There are a few different ways we could play this; he could be cold and rough with his new bride to be, perhaps later warming up to her. Or he could be a kind man, who is only rough in business when he has to be, but kind to her from the start. I\u2019m okay with either, and I\u2019m up for any changes you might have.\n\n2. Mutants: for this think x-men type of mutants, set in a time where mutants are hunted down and experimented on or even tortured. I don\u2019t have a plot line for this really, I\u2019m just thinking mutants in their 20s bumping into each other and teaming up to survive. Open to ideas and suggestions!\n\n3. Werewolves. I\u2019m a sucker for a good werewolf story.\n\nAnd please if you have something you want, bring it to me! I love hearing new ideas. Message me here so we can talk and plan before we start writing.",

I want to branch out and see If I can find a new roleplay partner.  My roleplay style is anywhere from semi-para to para. I am flexible when it comes to this.  I am open to smut roleplay as long my partner is over the age of 18, and so is the muse.  With that being said, I do like story-line roleplay and buildup.  I am fine with original characters and canon characters.

This roleplay will explore the mythos Lovecraft made when he wrote, specifically the old gods and their madness inducing presence.\n\nI'll be taking on the role of a companion to your character, and though I won't be GMing in such a broad sense, I'll still be picking up side characters to make the story work. You're welcome to pick up side characters too, of course, RPs should be an enjoyable collaboration after all!\n\nElements like gore, violence and all round eldritch monstrosities will be involved, and while I'm open to NSFW stuff within the roleplay, I'd like to focus on the story that we'll come up with.\n\nI'm a 21 year old uni student, in the GMT timezone, I've got a lot of free time since I've just finished for the summer, so I should be able to reply quite quickly. I'd appreciate it if anyone interested is over the age of 18 for obvious reasons.\n\nSo far I've got a decent plan of the initial roleplay so if you're interested, feel free to send me a message and we can exchange contact information!",

Just one thing in particular--*The Phantom of the Opera.* I would like to find an *Intermediate to Advanced* partner who will join me on an adventure through late-1800s Paris as we completely screw up the story and torment our characters to our hearts' content.\n\nI prefer *MxF romance* and would give my firstborn to write as Christine opposite Erik. *Google Docs* is my preferred medium, though I like using Discord for OOC chat. I want a friend as much as a writing partner, so come prepared to nerd out on PotO stuff. We'll exchange writing samples to ensure style compatibility.\n\nPM me if interested\\~",

While our last server, Alpha Vortex, was based on Manga &amp; Anime, Gamma Vortex is based on Video Games.\n\nSet in 2005 in the United Kingdom, this universe is set in a time where the world\u2019s population is split in half between normal people, and superpowered humans dubbed Calamities. These Calamities were either born with or gained mysterious powers known as Kores. These \u2018Kores\u2019 are in short, are the soul of a particular character with people absorb, gaining their powers, abilities and maybe even begin to act like those characters.\n\nThe Vortex series has a Semi-Literate writing standard, so we do not accept one-liners in terms of writing, despite this we don\u2019t expect paragraphs for each post (Although that\u2019s encouraged). We just ask you to maintain a healthy middle ground.\n\nOur staff is always here to help, if you have any more questions, technical server-side questions, or if you need writing advice, we\u2019re always happy to help you out. We strive for a friendly community, that you can also mess around with.\n\nIf any of that interested you, please stop by, even if it\u2019s just to check the server out.\n\nhttps://discord.gg/HEkK9CC",

            "selftext": "Back when great beasts roamed the land, back when the human race had barely managed to tame the wonders of fire, back when we used stone tools and shared the earth with clans of neanderthals, back to the beginning of our most ancient ancestors, that's where I want to go. \n\nI want to delve into the history of the children of the great Earth Mother, with their passionate creativity and genius for innovation. Or perhaps the even more ancient Clan, with their ancestral memories and traditions as old as stone. The world of our most ancient ancestors is open for us to explore. The loom is set, and a wonderful tapestry of stories is ready to be woven. What will we craft together? There's only one way to know...\n\n-----\n\nHi there! I hope you're having a good day :)\n\nIdeally, I would absolutely love to do a plot set in the world of the Earth's Children book series, since it's an awesome world that's wide open for all kinds of stories to be told. If you haven't read those books, don't worry! The setting is quite open ended and easy to learn, and there are definitely ways to work around a lack of previous knowledge if you'd still like to try using that setting. Or we could simply do a more general prehistoric setting in general, perhaps making up our own setting and culture for our cavepeople characters and letting them run riot in a world of our own creation. I would like to do a plot set in the world of Earth's Children if at all possible, but if the idea of a realistic story set back before the invention of the wheel sounds interesting to you in general, I don't mind if we scrap the setting and make one of our own.\n\nI've been rping off and on for about ten years in various different ways and mediums, so I'd like to think I know a thing or two about the craft. I'm hardly a master writer, but I'm literate and at least semi advanced, and I'm always open to criticism and learning new things. I would apriciate it if my partner was of a similar standard, meaning the sort of person who can usually post at least a paragraph or two of well thought out content more often than once a fortnight. In this particular case, I'd also apriciate some knowledge of stone age humans with regard to things such as their level of technology, but that's not required. \n\nI enjoy OOC chatter, and I hope we can both talk with each other about the story and what we hope to happen, what's going well or poorly, and maybe just how our days have been every now and then. I'd also apriciate someone who's willing to be up front about things I can be doing better. I'm willing and able to hold myself to the same standard, and do what I can to accommodate any desires or preferences my partner will have.\n\nI'd like to keep this short and sweet, so I'll end it here for the time being. If what I've said here interests you at all, feel free to messege me! Go ahead and hit me up in my inbox and we can figure things out from there, if I don't reply back soon, it's because I'm either asleep or busy for a bit. Also, just so I know you've read this far, please include the word \"butterscotch\" somewhere in your messege, it helps me weed out the \"hi, I'd like to rp\" and nothing more people.\n\nHope to hear from you soon! :)",

A permanent outpost had been established on the Moon, called Plato-1, in the year 1950 marking a significant step in mankind's quest for the stars. Then in 1958, a probe sent by the United States arrived at Mars and made a discovery that would change the course of human history forever. The probe sent back images of alien beings and structures before losing contact. All further attempts to send probes to Mars were met with failure. This did not deter the world's greatest minds from devising plans to allow them to communicate with this alien life. These same alien lifeforms invaded the moon in 1967 and began to attack facilities all across the surface, killing and devouring all in their path. They were thus named Beings of Extraterrestrial origin which is Adversary of human race or BETA for short. Humanity's fight for survival had just begun.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe BETA landed on Earth in 1973 after the recall of all forces on the Moon. From here on, they began a gruesome, and brutal harvest of all life and resources located on the planet. All attempts to communicate with the BETA were met with absolute failure. Years pass with the majority of Europe and Asia being taken over leaving the world wondering if nothing will turn the battle in their favor. Hundreds of Millions of lives lost, entire countries destroyed, and land stripped of all resources. Society stands on the brink of collapse as unrest spreads among the civilian and refugee populations due to food shortages and terrible living conditions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn 1999, Operation Lucifer, the greatest large-scale counteroffensive operation in Asia, second only to Operation Palaiologos in the entirety of the BETA Wars, begins. The priority objectives are the destruction of the Yokohama Hive and the recovery of Honshu Island. The UN deploys Special Task Force A-01 to secure G-Elements and keep a check on the like-minded US forces.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe USA, with little warning to allied forces, deploys two G-Bombs at the Yokohama Hive, eradicating the surface Hive structure and its surrounding BETA. This is the first successful Hive capture in human history. The remaining BETA begin their retreat towards Asia, suffering heavy losses from UN/COSEAN TSF/naval pursuit forces.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOperation Lucifer officially ends with the capture of the Yokohama Hive. Despite the victory, the G-Bomb deployment further intensifies anti-US sentiment in the Empire of Japan.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n It is now November 2001, test flight for Project Eden was launched. This was a month prior to Operation 21st.  \n\n    Invite link:\n\n[https://discord.gg/swnEqWv](https://discord.gg/swnEqWv)",

I'd love to find a Rose of Sharon Cassidy for New Vegas, though, or a Cait for Fallout 4 for my Sole Survivor. That'd make my day, really! I'm big on romance, fluff, and angst, so bring it all on! If you're interested, please shoot a PM my way!",

            "selftext": "Hey there, I'm currently looking for someone to GM a one-on-one RP. I have an idea in mind for each of the fandoms I've listed, but I'm open to whatever suggestions you may have.\n\n**I want you to be the GM. That means you would control the world, NPCs, events, and the outcome of my actions, while I simply control my character.**\n\nIf any of the ideas below strike your interest, please shoot me a message.\n\nDo note, all the ideas below are just that: ideas. If you've got a different idea for one of the fandoms I'm looking for, I'm always ready to hear it.\n\n**Haruhi Suzumiya**\n\nCraving this one the most. My idea is for the RP to be set either during, after, or before the events of the anime. My character would be a time-traveller who travels back in time to escape from a dystopian future and ends up enrolling in the same school as Haruhi (could be middle-school, high school, or university, depending on when you want the RP to take place). I'm also open to the RP taking place in the Disappearance Universe, or a Universe entirely separate from anything in the anime or manga.\n\n**KonoSuba**\n\nMy character would be a member of the Adventurer Guild in the world of KonoSuba, though he could either be a native there or end up there like Kazuma. The RP could be entirely OCs or have canon characters, though I'd prefer canon characters to be in it, whether on their own or with OCs sprinkled in (especially since I'm absolutely in love with Megumin).\n\nI do have one idea for the story that's pretty far detached from the story and structure of the show. My character would be a native to the world, or at least someone who's been there a long time. He'd be a monster hunter who runs a restaurant. He goes out and hunts monsters solely to supply meat for the restaurant. It'd be a mix of a restaurant management type of thing, as well as having a lot of monster hunting. He could also take on quests for people, in exchange for getting to hire them as employees (either working as party members or in the restaurant). There could even be sections where he travels to other places to set up more restaurants or to hunt exotic monsters.\n\nOf course, if you aren't a fan of that, we could have the more standard fare of an adventurer and his party taking on quests and exploring the world. In that case, it might be more interesting to give the entire RP a road trip vibe, instead of having it take place around a central hub\n\n\n**Dragon Ball**\n\nIn the far-future of the main series (or in an alternate universe), the dragon balls become closely guarded to prevent anyone unworthy from making wishes. Each of the dragon balls is held by a Keeper. Every ten years, the Keepers set up a world-spanning event, where everyone is invited to participate. All participants gather at one place, at which point the locations of all seven Keepers is revealed to them. From then on, it's a race to not only reach the various Keepers, but to pass their tests in order to obtain their dragon balls. Once all the dragon balls are taken from their Keepers, the location of a hidden shrine is revealed to everyone who has at least one of the dragon balls. The dragon balls only work when gathered together at this shrine, drawing all the holders to one spot for a final battle.\n\nI think this idea would be great in terms of character development. All characters would be working towards the goal of having their one wish granted while on a long journey, giving them plenty of time to develop. I'm thinking that before the race begins, some time can be spent showing the main characters training for it. Maybe they're training together, or maybe they're miles apart and only meet for the first time at the starting point of the race.\n\n**Kingdom Hearts**\n\nMy idea for this RP is to play as an amnesiac Keyblade-wielding Nobody. He cannot remember anything at all, not his past when he was a whole person, nor the reason he became a Nobody in the first place. His only clue is the fact that he has two Keyblades, one of which he can feel isn't his. The RP would be his journey as he tries to regain his heart and his memories. It could take place either during, before, or after the games, or even take place in an alternate timeline/universe.\n\nThere could, of course, also be a central villain of the story. Perhaps the villain (or maybe even a group of villains) had some role in my character becoming a Nobody, and through conflict with them, my character comes closer and closer to finding the truth.\n\n**Touhou**\n\nWould love an RP set in the wonderful world of Gensokyo! I was thinking my character would be from the Outside World who ends up in Gensokyo during the start of the RP or beforehand. From there, he'd slowly start to explore the world and meet the various characters in it. Maybe there's an incident going on, or maybe he's in Gensokyo during the events of one of the games. In any case, this is one we could definitely discuss further.\n\n**Marvel**\n\nI'm a big fan of the MCU films and have been pretty interested in an RP related to Marvel. Doesn't necessarily have to be set in the MCU, and I'd probably actually prefer an alternate Universe so we have a bit more free-reign with what we want to do with the characters and world. I was thinking that the RP would begin with an origin story for my character, with him either facing a canonical villain or an original character. After that point, the Universe could open up and include more of the heroes from Marvel. It doesn't necessarily have to immediately go into something like the Avengers where everyone comes together to fight a big threat, but maybe the heroes could be slowly introduced one at a time into the story.\n\nIt could also take place some time after Endgame, maybe with the current Avengers keeping on the lookout for someone else who could fill out their ranks, and eventually stumbling upon my character.\n\nMy idea for a character is a discharged war veteran who, during combat, discovered his ability to decelerate time (to an extent) for both living and non-living things. He's the owner, proprietor, and sole employee of a quiet bar, loved by its regulars for the way time just seems to slow down whenever they step in and grab a seat.",
