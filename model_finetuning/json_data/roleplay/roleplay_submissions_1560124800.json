You'll find a relaxed pace of life, quaint shops, friendly people, lovely sights.\n\nOh, did we mention monsters?\n\nOk, not so much monsters, per se. Not all of them. Most people in Potterstown are humans like the rest of us. But there's also elves, goblins, vampires, demons, shapechangers...maybe an alien or two. Maybe that's why the residents refer to their home as Monstertown, USA.\n\nStill want to visit? We hope so! We feature:\n\n- Unique and original lore and setting.\n- Near endless possibilities for races and backgrounds.\n- Friendly and helpful staff.\n- Compelling and original stories and adventures.\n\nMonstertown USA is a setting in which humans and non-humans have forged an agreement to live in peace and harmony together in a small American town. Can this noble experiment succeed? Will the fragile facade that protects the town from scrutiny continue to hold? Can mankind truly be at peace with that which it considers monsters?

I managed to try both chat and forum roleplaying, and while I enjoy both, nowadays I tend to have less time to get into those long, all-in-one-sitting types of stories. I am able to, more less, post at least once a day, perhaps more, and I would like for my partner to be able to keep a similar schedule (shame to lose interest after waiting for an answer for over a week).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to think I'm literate enough, though English is not my native language. I don't mind if the posts are semi-short, if they have substance. All in all, if we can provide something for the other person to work with, it doesn't matter to me if it's five, fifteen or fifty sentences. That being said, I absolutely love to create stories AND to read, so the longer and more detailed, the better!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am a big fan of implementing romantic aspects into my roleplays, and I don't shy away from NSFW content, as long as it has a place in the story and isn't done just for the sake of being there. When it comes to genres, I enjoy a variety: from fantasy, sci-fi, to modern, slice-of-life, post-apocalyptic, and so on. I guess lately I've been craving a good slice-of-life, but I am open to everything. I do have some ideas, but I prefer to talk things over with my partner first, so we find something that would work for both of us. Overall, I enjoy the \"on the road\" trope a lot, and I have a soft spot for frenemies and growing chemistry between the characters.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLastly, I genuinely don't care whether you are a male or a female, as long as you are over 18 years old (due to possible NSFW content) and willing to play a male character in this case. I generally play female characters, but I had my fair share of male ones, as well. I enjoy focusing on a single main character (with a plethora of side ones, if needed), and I don't expect my partner to roleplay multiple characters, either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope to talk to some of you soon - have a good day!",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone! \n\nI am female, over 18 and seeking long-term roleplay partners. I am fine with males and females. I enjoy and am comfortable roleplaying in 1st person, but I can do 3rd if needed. I am not looking for people that just want to ghost after a day. I am seeking people that want to be long-term. If you have an idea, please let me know what it is and maybe we can give it shot! Here are my ideas:\n\nZombie: The apocalypse has destroyed the world. Buildings were on fire, people were dead on the ground and some survivors are even killing people to survive. I am one of the very few sane survivors that is trying to find a sane group to survive with. My luck was about to run out when a large group of zombies comes charging after me. I decide to take shelter in a grocery store where you are trying to stock up on food and water. \n\nReal Life: I have many scenarios for these. They can range from anything \n-Roommates\n-Strangers\n-Co-Workers\n-College Life\n- High School\n\n\nFantasy- This was kind of a new idea that I came up with. You can play as a vampire, werewolf or human. I am fine with what you choose to roleplay as. The story is that the war is over between werewolves and vampires. Everyone is trying to survive. \nSome directions that this can take is that I am a vampire and you are a werewolf and we are friends that try to see other even if it's not allowed. Bring your own ideas if you have them as well! \n\nThank you very much for reading! If you are interested, send me a message! If not, have a great rest of the day and weekend!",

            "selftext": "Hiya everyone!  \n\n\nFirst off, sorry if you guys have had me as friends on Discord. I tend to overreact when it comes to panic attacks so I almost deleted my account. I'm working really hard on it, and RPing does help me relax when it comes to this stuff, just that my most recent one was pretty severe. I know promises don't mean a lot when it comes to online, but I do promise to not go poof on anyone ever again. I do consider every partner I have as a friend, so hopefully you all can give me a second chance.   \n\n\nFor those who don't know me, my name is Sofie! I'm a 18 year old female Russian-American student from the West Coast of the United States! I'm a full fledged weeb, spending most of my free time playing video games and watching anime! I also love to work on cosplays, as well as hanging out with friends! And in case if anyone is wondering, my favorite announcements from E3 are Cyberpunk, Ghostwire, the FF7 remake, and the FF8 remaster!  \n\n\nYes, as you can probably tell I'm a big Final Fantasy fan. My favorite ones are 2, 6, and 8, with 8 being my top! I really enjoyed 15 and 13 too, even if some don't like those as much. I like all FF games really, just some more than others. Square Enix's recent E3 presentation have fueled my desire to do a Final Fantasy RP! I've always wanted to try my hands at playing one of the franchise's cute ladies. I'm open to all female characters, but the ones I'm really looking to play are:   \nLightning, Yufie, Tifa, Aerith, Rinoa, Terra, Iris, Aranea, and Rikku  \n\n\nI'm open to either doing a Dissidia type crossover story, or something based in each character's game. This is a 18+ RP, so adult scenes will be present. I really like romance along with writing those scenes, but they won't take up the whole RP. Certain characters like Iris will be aged up to be 18 so that way no one is uncomfortable. I'm okay with FxF and FxM pairings, and your IRL gender doesn't matter to me so don't feel discouraged if you want to play a different gender than your irl one!  \n\n\nI have around 5 years of RP experience, and usually write 1-3 paragraphs per response. I can do both first and third person, so I leave up to my partner to decide which one to use. Aside from the RP details, I really do hope to make new friends, engaging in OOC chat and maybe playing some stuff on PC together! Anyways, I think I've made my post long enough, so please PM me with your Discord username and your favorite FF game. Hope to hear from you all soon!",

Project Minerva is a multi-year trial of a space station, built in conjunction with NASA, that is capable of sustaining human life on an indefinite basis.

If you\u2019re interested, we\u2019ll be holding application days in each country\u2019s capital city, along with other major cities across the world. We\u2019re looking for people from all walks of life, from every background. Thank you for listening, and we hope to see you onboard Minerva Station soon.\u201d*\n\nWelcome to Minerva Station!

I consider myself an advanced writer not just because of the amount I write per post, but because I try to take care and use evocative, descriptive language and write characters that have realistic goals and motivations. I prefer to write in the 3rd person/past tense, but if you can make a case for doing 1st person or doing present tense, go for it. I can be open.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs the title says I'm really interested in doing an Animorphs RP although I would like to do it as original characters. Basically I would like all of the lore surrounding the Yeerks/Andalites and the rules of morphing to stay the same, but the group from the books would never have existed and we would have our own origin story for getting our morphing powers. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf there are multiple people who express interest in this I'd be down to do a small group, maybe 3 or 4. Or just 1x1! I'm also looking to write other in other established universes, mainly Harry Potter and Star Wars, so if you don't want to do Animorphs but think we might make good partners for other prompts, let me know!  \n\n\nShoot me a PM with your Discord name, or just shoot me a PM!",

There\u2019s lots of blood and violence in the films themselves and this will be no different. Also, there is a possibility of some sexual themes (if we decide to go down that route).\n2. At least one paragraph in each response. We\u2019re telling a story together, though during dialogue I\u2019m flexible for this rule. I only roleplay in 3rd person and prefer my partners to do so as well, though like I\u2019ve mentioned before, I\u2019m a bit open-minded.\n3. Be open to new ideas and be friendly OOC! I\u2019ve got a plot ready for us to do, but I\u2019d love to hear some suggestions as well!\n4. OC\u2019s only. The John Wick films are pretty great, but I\u2019m not a huge fan of the usage of already established characters. \n\nI\u2019m open to Discord, Kik, and am open to roleplaying on any other medium! Message me for usernames or if you\u2019re just interested and wanna talk about it!\n\nThanks for reading! And also...\n\n\n\n*\u201dBe seeing you.\u201d*",

            "selftext": "Everybody knows Sideline Community. After all, they've secured their place as one of the biggest names in modern alt-rock after their first album was released, immediately capturing fans. Part of their charm is the individual members and their personalities: sweet but insecure Anya, friendly but oblivious Corey, confident but gruff Jade, and energetic but flighty Roaran. It was a big shock to fans when Roaran, the guitarist, quit the band to pursue a solo project. After weeks of uncertainty, it was announced that the band would not disband, however, they would instead fill Roaran's spot by holding open auditions. Many tried out, but only one could get the spot, and that person was you. \n\nHowever, upon meeting the band in person, you realized that there might have been more going on there than you thought. Specifically, with Anya. Her low body weight has been the subject of rumors time and time again, but she looks even more unhealthy in person. What's more, she's weak and exhausted all the time, and comments that Jade and Corey make point to something insidious going on with her mental health. Maybe it's not your business, you're just the newbie after all, but it's clear that something needs to be done...\n\n* This will be primarily a role play between Anya and your character, but I will control Corey and Jade as needed, as well. You are also welcome to bring side characters to the table, as many as are needed.\n\n* I'd like this to develop into a romance RP! As Anya is bi, you may play whatever gender you're most comfortable with.\n\n* Role play will be done on Discord, either on my semi-public server or on a private server. I do not role play via DMs.\n\n* I'm okay with NSFW bits, but it will not be the main focus of the role play.\n\n* Send me a message if you're interested!",

            "selftext": "Having a cute son can become an immediate chick magnet for a guy.  I\u2019m looking to play as a single dad and have a few different starters below for what hopefully becomes a long term romance roleplay. \n\nPlease note that in this roleplay I am NOT in any way looking to include a young child in any sexual activity.  It is simply a plot point.  I\u2019m not into any illegal underage acts.\n\nThat being said, I\u2019ll be playing as a 27-29 year old guy with a son in the 3-5 range.  Below are a couple opening scenarios that I\u2019m hoping can lead into a long term roleplay.  As you\u2019ll see, some are more specific and detailed, while some are more open ended.\n\n*Family Friends*\nWe grew up on the same street, even though I\u2019m about 8 years older than you.  Our families got very close and when parents moved away I had established myself here so I stayed.  I\u2019ve got a son that I still bring by to see your parents off and they love babysitting or taking him to lunch.  Your boyfriend thinks that you have a thing for me, and that I want to get into your pants. \n\n*Sports League*\nWe meet playing in a long adult co ed basketball or softball league.  We could be on the same tram or competing teams.  You could be a regular or just filling in for a friend.  And our main initial convos can take place at the game or the bar afterwards where everyone goes.\n\n*The Beach*\nYou\u2019re at the beach with some friends when you see a little boy that looks familiar.  Upon second glance you realize it\u2019s your older sister\u2019s friend\u2019s son.  You decide to come over and say hi to him, and introduce yourself to me. (Also open to playing this out at the mall, bowling, or a carnival/county fair.)\n\n*Football on Sunday*\nI\u2019m at the sports bar with a few friends watching the games.  My 5 year old son is with us and he\u2019s got all his gear on too eating his chicken tenders and fries.  You\u2019re there with some friends? Rooting for the same teams as us or maybe the opposite?\n\n*Alumni*\nI\u2019m an alum of the university you go to.  You\u2019re volunteering to work an alumni event or reunion and we meet there.\n\n*The Babysitter*\nYou babysit for my son\u2019s mother.  We\u2019ve never met but one day she tells you that his father will be coming to pick him up to take him for a long weekend.  When I get to her apartment we chat for a few minutes, and maybe get a bit flirty.  You find me on Facebook through her friends and add me, then send me a message.\n\n*Pumpkin Picking*\nYou and your college roommate/friend are in full basic white girl mode with your leggings and uggs taking selfies at the pumpkin patch.  Having some fun, I send him over to try and pick up a pumpkin that\u2019s clearly way to heavy for him and watch the humor that ensues.  Me and you (and your friend?) start talking and decide t hang out.\n\n\n*Daycare/Pre School*\nYou can be a teacher? Another parent? Perhaps an older sister that sometimes picks up and/or drops off?\n\nMessage me to start discussing details! I\u2019m looking for probably 1-3 paragraphs in roleplaying, possibly a bit more if setting up a new scene in it.",

I\u2019d probably reach out faster as well) I hope you all are having a great day and want to start out by saying thank you for checking out my post! I\u2019m looking for an 18+ male. Mostly because I like to have adult themes in my Roleplay to allow from some conflict and tension.\n\nSo just to start out with, here are some Genres I\u2019m into doing (just I heads up I don\u2019t do fandoms)\n\n-Fantasy (All Kinds)\n\n-Superhero \n\n-Mystery\n\n-Slice of Life (if it has a really developed story)\n\n-My main Interest currently is for a dark gripping romance to push the story forward, if you\u2019re interested we can go into details \n\nAnd there is one genre I won\u2019t do and that is Post Apoc. It\u2019s not my favorite and most likely won\u2019t do it.\n\nSome other things you should know is I am an artist so I usually draw most of my face claims, however I don\u2019t require you to have any face claims, descriptions are fine with me.\n\nResponses should be a paragraph or more. I tend to get lengthy with my responses which can be really fun if the partner is doing that as well!\n\nI am usually on 24/7 most of the time (PST.) However I only require my partners to at least post once a day, and if something comes up in life? Don\u2019t worry about it, just don\u2019t forget to tell me.\n\nLastly I just want to thank you again for reading! As I said I do like using discord, so send me a reply, and don\u2019t be shy! Put your discord on there as well so we can get talking right away! (I will respond quicker if you put a discord tag in your response. :3) Have a good day!",

            "selftext": "Ever hit the point in life where finally it's possible to sit and think  about what hobbies are? What free time is? For me this happened within  the last week, leading to a lot of \"When was I last happy?\" contemplation. Roleplaying and writing is something that I enjoyed, but  couldn't keep up with during college. With that chapter finished, I am  looking to make new friends through roleplaying again! I have been  roleplaying for over a decade and am out of practice. Character genders  don't necessarily matter to me in that I am comfortable exploring *male, female, non-binary roles*. Consent is something I appreciate and would love to include; however, I also enjoy *dark and problematic themes, unkind fae/fairy worlds, horror, and romance*.  I'm not going to shoehorn in feelings that would drive our characters  together. Smutty is fine, prolonged smut is not. In the past, I loved  finding music and imagery that suited the responses/scene that we would  work on. I also enjoy drawing and sketching up character designs and am  looking to break back into ye old procreate with whatever we create  together. \n\nIf  male characters are a breaker, that isn't an issue if we click person  to person and compromise on a fun plot. Optimally, you are someone that  prefers the third person narrative, is literate, and doesn't need more  than 8 paragraphs every time. Believe me, I luxuriate in the  environmental and character development as much as the next person but  sometimes it's just tedious. Be cognizant of the idea that I am looking  forward to hearing from you; I will appreciate a heads up if the story  isn't clicking or if you aren't planning on responding for a couple of  days. Discord is preferable to direct messaging or email. I'm on EDT,  but that's not necessarily what I am expecting or looking for in a  partner. For sake of life experience I'd prefer to connect with someone  in their mid-later twenties and onward.\n\nAlso,  I am a huge sucker for the enemies to lovers trope - if you are into  that please let me know! Starting out as enemies isn't necessary. It's  more narratively interesting to see the build-up and break-down for the  characters.",

            "selftext": "Hi! Like the title says, I have a bunch of ideas that I'd like to go through. I'd consider myself Semi-Literate, maybe a paragraph at most with a few exceptions. My timezone is EDT.\n\nOriginal Ideas will be before the Fandom ones (that doesn't mean I prefer OG), but here's some rules first.\n\n1: I'm Bi, so either gender will work for anything unless otherwise stated, and I don't mind if you play the opposite gender. MxM and FxF are perfectly fine.\n\n2: After we start, do not ghost me, please! If you want to stop, just tell me instead of leaving me wondering.\n\n3: Some of these require NPC's from time to time, so if you're fine with playing a few characters at some points, that'd be great! But if you aren't, that's fine too!\n\n4: Start a Reddit Convo and I'll give you my discord! I'd like to go off Reddit dm's quickly since they're a bit hard to work with.\n\n6: All my ideas will be on a scale from 1-10, depending on how much I'd like to do it. 1 is a \"If you want\" and 10 is a \"Want to do now\" but if you want to do one with a lower score, that's fine!\n\nAlright! Now that that's out of the way, here are my ideas!\n\n--OG--\n\n[7/10] Person X A.I.\n\nSomeone finds a broken storage device somewhere, and after fixing it discovers an A.I. so advanced it acts just like a person.\n\n[5/10] Trans M2F X Person\n\nA recently-transitioned girl begins dating someone, making them feel more at ease about everything.\n\n[9/10] Human X Ghost\n\nSomeone who can see ghosts always found them annoying, always wanting to \"get revenge\" and the like, moves to a small, but growing city and meets the one ghost there that only wants one thing: someone to talk to.\n\n[9/10] Guy in a Girl's school\n\nA boy's life had been rather hectic. He had been forced to move frequently, making staying in one school rather... difficult. Now, that has changed; He was accepted at a boarding school. But as he arrived, he realised a major mistake: it was an all-girls school! With nowhere to go, the principal suggest a strange idea: him disguising as a girl and attending the school.\n\n[7/10] Invisible person\n\nOne day, someone woke up with a strange predicament: nobody could see or hear them! months later, they were walking through a crowd of people when they someone bumped them to the ground, to which they were used to. The thing they weren't used to, however, is the person trying to help them up. They could see them?!\n\n--Fandom!--\n\nMy Hero Academia\n[7/10] Hero Toga X anyone\n\nToga becomes (for lack of a better term) normal, and joins U.A. for protection against the league. Someone from Class A helps her through this stressful time.\n\n[8/10] Female Midoriya X Anyone (except Bakugo)\n\nOne day during basic patrol, Midoriya was hit with a quirk that turned him into a girl! He needs some help coping with this... change.\n\n[7/10] Mina X Jirou, Momo, Ochaco, or Midoriya\n\n[7/10] OC/Next-Gen OC X Anyone/OC/Next-Gen OC\n\n\nMob Psycho 100\n[6/10] Shigeo X OC\n\nA new student has joined Mob's class, and this new student happens to be psychic.\n\nJojo's Bizarre Adventure\n[5/10] User X Stand\n\nA person suddenly gains a stand, one with free will.\n\n----\n\nAgain, DM me if your interested. Thank You!",

            "selftext": "Hello there! This is my second time reaching out about this little plot i have going on in my head, and the more i think about it, the more  I really want to find someone willing to write about our with me! My name is Bree, and I am 20 years old. I have extensive roleplaying experience of about 7 years on and off, and would love to get back into the swing of things. My schedule is pretty open, basically being able to reply and collab unless I'm sleeping, since I work from home and my boyfriend is almost always away ): . My favorite genres would have to be fantasy, and slice of life. Mixing the two together make me the happiest, haha. Lately Ive been itching to do a twist on the nerdy/shy highschool girl meets bad boy/bully generic slice of life but add a twist.. What if they're set in a fantasy land with magical creatures and fairies and witches and wizards and things like that..? \n\nI have the idea to play the new girl in school, a freshman named Suzy Stone at Aero Magic Academy. You could be the bully, or the bad boy/girl who wouldn't be caught dead with me(or whatever you prefer!!). We get into some sort of altercation, whether it be a magical duel in the middle of the classroom because of a fight, sabatoging one or the others spell/classwork/project, and the Dean takes care of it by forcing us to work together on everything. Perhaps even transferring us to the same dorm. I use third person, reply at least a full paragraph or more, and I do prefer to use picture refrences with detailed descriptions as well. \n\nI havent really gotten over that little hump of what causes them to be stuck together, but after that, its smooth sailing in my eyes, already having my character picked out and everything! Uhm, Im not sure what else to say but if you like what you've read so far, feel free to shoot me a message! Thanks!",

            "selftext": "I literally couldn't think of a better title than that, I swear.\n\n\nThat aside, Hello! I'm back, today looking for less of a prompt, and more of a...general search? I have no idea. Before I get into the nitty gritty, allow me to say a bit about myself. I'm a 20-something male with plenty of writing experience, about 6ish years or so. I'm the kind of guy who (proudly) sprouts absurd and out there ideas, literally just on a whim or the slightest bit of inspiration. Seriously. Sometimes I can get a little crazy. My post length is anywhere between 1-3 paragraphs, but I came definitely get more out if I'm feeling inspired.  I'm also, for whom it might concern, in the central timezone of the United States. That being said, I have a horrid sleep schedule, so I'll usually be up pretty late into the night.\n\n\nWith that out of the way, let me say what I'm looking for. I am (unsurprisingly) looking for a female partner to nerd out with, 18+ of course, just in case we *do* go down a NSFW road at some point (It's welcome, but I'd like to not to be the focus of anything). **I will not, under any circumstances, write with someone under the age of 18**. I'm not comfortable with it, and I'm sorry if someone out there disagrees with this. Additionally, I'm looking for someone that I can call my friend. All proper and business is boring. I like to freak out with my writing partners. Come up with dumb plotlines or AUs. If you're looking for something strictly professional, I'm probably not your guy.\n\n\n\nFinally, we get down to what I'm *really* gonna be vague on. As you might've guessed by the title, I'm looking for something fantasy related. What specifically, you might ask? I have no clue. I'm a sucker for romance plots, with an epic adventure hanging above our characters' head. Be it slaying gods, or sealing away an ancient evil, I can't get enough of it. I love all sorts of different fantasy races, too. Elves? Oh yeah. Demons? Sure! Any kind of Yokai? *my god, that'll press my buttons in juuust the right way*. That being said, anyone that brings an idea with Kitsune as a major emphasis will make me *very* happy. Anyway. If you have any existing ideas, please, throw them at me! I love reading through plots n ideas. Want to create something new? We can chat for a bit, and see what we both like.\n\n\nI'm rambling now, aren't I? I think I've gone on for long enough. If I've caught your eye, please, shoot me a message, and I'll get to you ASAP. Just be sure to include your favorite color in your title, so I know you got down this far. I won't respond without it, because I don't enjoy it when people don't read my post. Like I said, I'm usually around into the late hours of the night, so you'll likely catch me. Thanks for reading!\n\n\n(Oh, by the way, don't send me a message only saying \"hey I think we can work something out\" or the like. Tell me about yourself, have some energy. Those kind of intros give me life)",

We consider ourselves a community foremost; a place for mature, capable writers to gather and have fun without the need to fear super restrictive rules. As such, we\u2019ve forgone the heavy regulation on powers and abilities and chose instead to give as much creative freedom to our users as we can. Here, you will be able to write your creations how you want to write them (with the caveat of not ruining other people\u2019s fun, of course).\n\nAs for our applicants, we have a firm-but-fair policy. If you meet our standards, you\u2019re already almost a member! You might be asking yourself, what are those standards? Well, have no fear, because they\u2019re coming right at \u2018cha!\n\n\u2022 The applicant must be **at least seventeen years of age.** We can't stress this enough. While we try to be as accessible as possible, this is just a comfortability thing. Most of our members are adults and feel weird about writing with younger people. That and some of the content is R-rated (violence, angst and all that good stuff, get your minds out of the gutter).\n\n\u2022 We're inclusive of all races, gender identities, and sexual orientations! If you're incapable of accepting this, the community probably won't be a fit for you.\n\n\u2022 While we don't enforce a strict requirement for post length, we do like to see literacy to make our inner writers insecure. As such, we would much appreciate it if you're capable of writing coherent paragraphs.\n\n\u2022 Most importantly, be a pleasant person! We understand that everyone's got bad moods and a mean side, but we'd rather support you than get into a war of words over it?\n\nInterested and meet our criteria?

Im currently looking to so a long term superhero/vigilante roleplay the story will center around your character being recruited to join a team of heroes of various ages and backgrounds, and slowly becoming the greatest heroes the world has ever seen.\n\nIve done many roleplays in the past, hut this is one I'm particularly excited for, as i love superheroes/mythology. I love building a universe and building lore for for it, and i especially love stories about people rising up to do good in a world where people tell them that they cant.\n\nSo what can you expect from this roleplay? Action, drama, romance, and much more. As the GM I will he playing multiple characters, all of whom will be unique and interesting, and I'm not just talking about powers. Ill be taking lots of inspiration from other comics, and I will do my best to keep you hooked. \n\nThe stories will be divided into chapters, each chapter will focus on character development; characters will die, and others will be introduced, and the villains will test the heroes in ways you cant even imagine.\n\nIm purposefully being a little vague here... for more details, dm me! I can roleplay on discord or kik, and i look forward to hearing from you soon! If you text me please describe your characters powers and a short description of them fighting crime or saving someone.",

            "selftext": "Hello there! I am looking for a long term buddy, now before I get into anything I would like someone literate and at least creative with what they're writing. Also, the point of this is Romance too. I am fine with doing FXF, MXM, and MXF(me as male.) that's really the only point I can stress. I would like development, not our characters instantly in love or anything like that, a crush is different. I am open to your ideas as long as you don't control and force my role. \n\nI do plenty of Fandoms, I have been Roleplaying for years now and I can say I am very literate. I strive for that, makes everything better for me. I  do love a dark Roleplay, but if anything like that doesn't suit you then tell me. I wish not to make you uncomfortable. \n\nI Roleplay Naruto, Marvel, DC, Last of Us, Avatar, Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, Legend of Korra and Teen Wolf. I can play canon Characters, we can also mash together ships that don't exist too. And I am fine with OC, I also love themes with Supernatural. I always wanted a Werewolf Roleplay, or even a Vampire Roleplay would sound good to me. My favorite would be for Harry Potter or My Hero Academia, and Viking style with Dragons possibly. \n\nIf this one, we can create OC or play Canon Characters in a different direction than the running anime. If so I'd be interested in playing  Kaminari, Iida,Todoroki or even Bakugou. I can plot an idea out for any of these, and I wish for you to help me out with plotting in general. I don't expect you to go crazy with length. Just two would be fine, I love quality over quantity.\n\nI would rather have long term as well, and I mostly use Discord. You can message me information about it. In your message include something about yourself, and if you message can you make sure you're capable of literacy and semi long replies. Be friendly and creative! I won't answer if you don't tell me about yourself and what you're interested in. And what pairing you like, MxM or MxF. If not, It would show you didn't read any of it, and that you aren't interested much. That may not be the case but that's what it would seem as. Also tell me if you want to avoid NSFW or not.\n\nI only answer DM.",

Atricot Academy is a Catholic private high school for the youthful people of America who wish to take a turn for the better in their lives. The academy, much rather a boarding school, accepts students who are gifted in academics/other talents and students who are having trouble with their behavior.   \u2800As the 2020-2021 year begins, students notice right away by their homeroom class that no faculty or teachers are present. In fact, the only people who are on the campus are the students. Now, they must figure how to survive on their own with little communication with the outside world and their own twisted personalities. After all--pairing the next generation's future leaders with the next generation's top criminals isn't the wisest to do without any form of discipline nearby.  \n\n\ud83c\udf3c\ud83c\udf3b\ud83c\udf3c *Our server has. . .* **-** Friendly and experienced staff members! **-** Helpful guides with detailed explanations! **-** Visuals for every location on our own personalized map! **-** A lyric-less playlist to listen to while roleplaying! **-** Unique, finished lore with a mystery twist!  \ud83c\udf3c\ud83c\udf3b\ud83c\udf3c**SERVER LINK:** [https://discord.gg/35ZXfvf](https://discord.gg/35ZXfvf)",

I can also do Nsfw rp's but only when you're 18+ please. Oh and if you also don't have plots ready thats fine, I can usually think of some!\n\nI can either roleplay as male or female but I prefer roleplaying as male way more. I write in 3rd person (Its fine if you dont)  and I can make pretty long post so I'm looking for people who can do more then 1 line at a time. \n\nI can also do fandom roleplays, but I always prefer rping as my oc's rather then a canon person. \n\nAnd thats all I guess :D, so if you're interested pm me!",

Mature themes will be in my plots though limits will be\u00a0 discussed. write multiple paragraphs/novella style (200-500+ words). I\u00a0 love to write detailed descriptions and delve into a character\u2019s\u00a0 head/emotions as well as surroundings. I compare it to writing a novel\u00a0 together.\n\nI understand if the scene\u00a0 doesn\u2019t have alot going on and therefore requires less. I adore having\u00a0 long, thoughtful replies where we truly immerse ourselves in the world.\u00a0 I'm hoping to find a partner whose as enthusiastic about the plot and\u00a0 writing as I am. When I get invested in a story, it\u2019s 100% dedication.\u00a0 Getting a reply is the highlight of my day.\n\nI'm\u00a0 a big fan of romance and using face claims. I\u2019m the type to make\u00a0 pinterest boards, spam you with gifs, headcanons, and send you songs\u00a0 that remind me of our characters and/or ship. I'll get excited if we\u00a0 come up with a great plot idea or if our characters are being cute or\u00a0 going to get into trouble. I live for this kind of stuff honestly.\n\nLast but not least I only do MxF (with myself in the female role) and don\u2019t double, but I\u2019m more than happy to write side characters of either gender to help move the story along. I'd highly prefer female authors writing male characters as I've had too many bad encounters with male writers and at this point I'm uncomfortable with it. Sorry guys! \n\nDesperately Searching For:\n\n* 21+ partners\n* For you to have an excellent grasp of grammar, punctuation, spelling, and capitalization. Both in character and **out of character.** (Literate to advanced writers only, please. I'm not looking for newbies or those who English isn't thier first language).\n* For\u00a0 you to write as an older male (Late 30s to 40+). I'm a sucker for the\u00a0 gruff and tough men who secretly have a soft heart. I also love those\u00a0 grumpy, hypermasculine men being intimidated by darling, soft yet\u00a0 commanding, and pretty women.\n* The\u00a0 more description, the better! I'm looking for someone can write as much\u00a0 as me (2 to 4 paragraphs or more) and really bring the story to life. I\u00a0 lose interest if I'm the only one that's invested/enthusiastic or\u00a0 coming up with plot ideas. Quality writing makes my heart happy, as does\u00a0 world building together.\n* The\u00a0 use of real life face claims and joining me in the wonderful world of\u00a0 ship/character development isn't a requirement but I'd sure be delighted\u00a0 if we were on the same page in this regard. (I won't use anime faces,\u00a0 only art if you're uncomfortable with real life)\n* Someone\u00a0 who won't leave without warning or explanation after sending the first\u00a0 post. I'm looking for the long term here, and I have been greatly\u00a0 saddened by how many partners have left me high and dry recently.\n\nIf\u00a0 you've made it this far, thank you! You won't be disappointed in\u00a0 writing with me. I tend to be online daily and I'd like it if you were\u00a0 too. Please let me know if you're going to be inactive, long days/weeks\u00a0 of silence make me nervous.\n\nOriginal Genres:\n\n* Mafia/Crime\n* Post Apocalyptic/Dystopia\n* Supernatural/Modern Fantasy\n* Southern/Mid-Western/Urban Gothic \n* Western inspired/Weird West (supernatural and\u00a0 fantasy elements) \n* Sci-fi \n* Cyberpunk/Retro-Futuristic\n* Superpowers/Gifted\n\nFandoms: (Will only do oc x oc in the universe)\n\nStar\u00a0 Wars, X Files, Haven, The Blacklist, Fringe, Zoo, Stranger Things,\u00a0 Heroes, The Wolf Among Us, The Walking Dead, Mercy Thompson Series, True\u00a0 Blood, Stephen King's Universes, Red Dead Redemption, Marvel, The OA\n\nAll my characters will be adults and I require my partners to do the same. For plot and more genre ideas, please message me \\^ I prefer to write over email but use discord for chatting and writing, along with google docs.\n\nPlease\u00a0 be detailed when you message me, let me know why you chose to contact\u00a0 me.

He\u2019s been treated with an experimental drug called Chronos, granting him a unique perception of time allowing him to\nSlow time around him so he can cut bullets and escape tight situations.

Please send me a message if any of the following interests you!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout me:\n\n\\- I'm 30 years old and have been writing and roleplaying over a decade.\n\n\\- I only care that you are over 18. I deal with darker themes and RP, better safe than sorry.\n\n\\- I want to work with you, not against you. If it isn't working, we can work something else out entirely.\n\n\\- Eastern time zone, but I'm an insomniac and can get quite busy. I'll let you know my schedule in our initial conversations.\n\n\\- I prefer third person and decent grammar. It doesn't have to be perfect, just understandable.\n\n\\- I only RP via email, it's just convenient for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat I'm Looking For:\n\n\\- John Wick. I want to play against him as an OC in an action-filled drama/romance RP.\n\n\\- Vampires/supernatural characters.\n\n\\- Medieval (fantasy or low fantasy, whatever works).\n\n\\- Modern fantasy.\n\n\\- NSFW stuff is fine to write through or fade to black, whatever my partner prefers. I usually like to artistically write about it and avoid sounding like a Harlequin romance novel.\n\n\\- Complicated relationships.\n\n\\- Drama and romance in general.\n\n\\- Anything totally story driven.\n\n\\- I prefer to play female characters.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm friendly OOC and will be as open as you are. I understand that life happens and it does for me, too. I work full time and sometimes do step away from the computer. I'll let you know, but I typically range 2-4 posts per day or more when I'm inspired. Anything interest you? Shoot me a message. :)",

They are creations of mine and are in no way a form of fantasy for my self-gratification. I will not RP with self-inserts. For that reason, RP solely geared for smut is not in my interest._ \n\nNSFW elements are welcome, but not a focal point. I RP with people 21+.\n\nI\u2019m looking for somebody who has investments in their character creations; characters with backgrounds and history, characters that you, as a writer, know. Character development is key. \n\nI have characters from early twenties to mid thirties. Writing samples available on request. Rather than just spats it\u2019ll be more serious \u2014 kin to writing a book together. A story. The themes are dark, brutal in places and if our characters don\u2019t gel, I won\u2019t force a character change to get them to bond.\n\nLong replies are not necessary. **Quality over quantity.** I don't want six paragraphs of a character idly going through motions etc. \n\nMy characters and their themes are not for the faint of heart. Themes of substance abuse, drama, violence and genuine horror are all common in my writing. \n\n**Romance is on the cards if characters gel.** All kinds of characters are welcome \u2014 I enjoy cultivating both friendship and stories alongside one another. If you have an idea you'd like to discuss I'm happy to hear it, but I will _not_ shift my characters personalities or stories to fit something they were not written for.\n\nI may be tempted by fantasy elements if they're juicy. \n\n**Note:** My characters are female, as am I. I do not have a preference for sex/gender of my partner or their characters. I have more characters than listed, these are my mains.\n\nPM for character website.",

I'm looking for someone 21 or older to RP with since, frankly, RPing with anyone younger is illegal if you catch my drift.\n\nI need someone who doesn't censor themselves because my characters curse like a sailor, violence never has a filter, and romance isn't dead. That being said, Stephen King is my muse so if you don't like his writing style please move on because I write almost exactly like him.\n\nI require you to be literate. Please. Misspells are totes okay cause I rp on my phone and my phone thinks it's funny to make me spell things like a toddler, but grammatical mistakes and lack of description will be a major no-go for me.\n\nI'm looking for someone who RPs fandoms. No OCs please! I am looking for shippers so please contact me with the fandom you wanna RP and the ships you wanna do! I'm into video games, anime, Peter P./Wade W., and some TV shows. **Disclaimer: I apologize but I don't RP Game of Thrones, I know nothing of it.**\n\nAll fandoms have a SPOILER disclaimer. Please be willing to play both female and male characters! Playing multiple characters of multiple genders is something I'd prefer both parties to be able to do! :)\n\nPlease PM me what Fandom you wanna RP! This will be RPed over Discord. I am a full time College student and a Full-time worker so I'm usually not busy after work or on the weekend.\n\nCan't wait to hear from you!\n\n-- Kire",

            "selftext": "Morning, Roleplayers!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I have a *strange* but hoooopefully fun and engaging Roleplay Prompt for the summer, hopefully?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI really liked the Legend of Korra but I always thought it had some glaring issues that kept it being as fondly considered as the Last Airbender. Disjointed structure, arcs that kinda go no where, love triangles, and more. It being the Summer (woo!), I think we'll be able to cover quite a bit of story.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSecondly, while I don't want to turn this into an outright smut since I would like to keep it largely focused on characters, the story, and just try to keep it **in the spirit of the show**, I'm open to discussing NSFW elements\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThirdly, and here's the *strange* aspect that I would like to include and I understand if it's a dealbreaker but **I would like to play Korra not only mainly Earth Bending but also being awfully Well Endowed in this roleplay** \\^\\^; \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI really like playing strong, hot headed, cocky characters who happen to be weighed down by something embarrassing. I think it adds a lot of potential endearing moments that don't have to be explicit and I guess a possible comparison is the busty anime character who's strong and all but their ridiculous assets are sometimes used for comedic moments.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith Korra, I think there's a lot of opportunities and dynamics to play around with her having to deal with her body, trying to be taken seriously, living up being the next Avatar, being reluctantly only good at Earth Bending over Fire Bending (in my mind, Earth Bending is more about raw strength and being kinda immobile thanks to playing a more endowed Korra, haha), maybe Bolin and Korra would get together now since they're both Earth Benders :P\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[I wrote up a sample of how I would play this version of Korra here on Google Docs just as an example.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oFwJHi__qyZ60jGsbzbp7FRUZmhTUuFpXa-yp7MHkWU/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for who you'd play, I was hoping you would play as characters like Bolin, Mako, Asami, Tenzin, so on, and the villains/side characters we could swap around. I'm all up for discussing that too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe last point I'd like to include **but not a deal breaker** is if anyone happens to know how to play with RPG rules? I just started learning some basics on this FATE system which I think would be **perfect** for narrative randomness and chance. [I even made a character sheet already if you're interested.](https://fatecharactersheet.com/character/fate-core/68a4405b-3d50-4fc9-b4c4-67969486fb77/korra) So if you're a GM or know some basic RPG rules, maybe we can work something out. If not, I'm **totally fine** with keeping it like a normal RP.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo yeah, if anyone has any questions and/or would like to go on a fun, silly, maybe romantic long term RP with me, feel free to message me and we can work something out :)",

Echo 4 is covered in lush jungle and is just waiting to be discovered. We have a unique Archetype system in place to make character creation interesting and allow everyone to be included in RP. We host special missions into the jungle, where everyone who wants to be involved will play a special part in the overarching story of the server. Of course, special missions won't be the only time you can explore the planet. You can enter the jungles any time you want (but hopefully you've gained authorization from High ranking officers, otherwise you might get into trouble!!). When you do venture into the jungle- alone (not recommended) or in groups (super fun totally recommend)- there is a fun random encounter system in place to help you RP that you can choose to use. Each expedition into the jungle can bring random fun to everyone there- whether it be discovering new creatures, or surviving the perils of uncharted terrain, there's something for everyone.\n\nAnd we have an active event right now.\n\nIt's a brand new server, but please feel free to join!\u00a0\n\nhttps://discord.gg/JtShmm9",

            "selftext": "Hiya everyone! If you see this post then I'm still looking for partners! Please read through to the end to see how and what to contact me with!\n\nFirst off, sorry if you guys have had me as friends on Discord. I tend to overreact when it comes to panic attacks so I almost deleted my account. I'm working really hard on it, and RPing does help me relax when it comes to this stuff, just that my most recent one was pretty severe. I know promises don't mean a lot when it comes to online, but I do promise to not go poof on anyone ever again. I do consider every partner I have as a friend, so hopefully you all can give me a second chance.\n\nFor those who don't know me, my name is Sofie! I'm a 18 year old female Russian-American student from the West Coast of the United States! I'm a full fledged weeb, spending most of my free time playing video games and watching anime! I also love to work on cosplays, as well as hanging out with friends! And in case if anyone is wondering, my favorite announcements from E3 are Cyberpunk, Ghostwire, the FF7 remake, and the FF8 remaster!\n\nYes, as you can probably tell I'm a big Final Fantasy fan. My favorite ones are 2, 6, and 8, with 8 being my top! I really enjoyed 15 and 13 too, even if some don't like those as much. I like all FF games really, just some more than others. Square Enix's recent E3 presentation have fueled my desire to do a Final Fantasy RP! I've always wanted to try my hands at playing one of the franchise's cute ladies. I'm open to all female characters, but the ones I'm really looking to play are:  \nLightning, Yufie, Tifa, Aerith, Rinoa, Terra, Iris, Aranea, and Rikku\n\nI'm open to either doing a Dissidia type crossover story, or something based in each character's game. This is a 18+ RP, so adult scenes will be present. I really like romance along with writing those scenes, but they won't take up the whole RP. Certain characters like Iris will be aged up to be 18 so that way no one is uncomfortable. I'm okay with FxF and FxM pairings, and your IRL gender doesn't matter to me so don't feel discouraged if you want to play a different gender than your irl one!\n\nI have around 5 years of RP experience, and usually write 1-3 paragraphs per response. I can do both first and third person, so I leave up to my partner to decide which one to use. Aside from the RP details, I really do hope to make new friends, engaging in OOC chat and maybe playing some stuff on PC together! Anyways, I think I've made my post long enough, so please PM me with your Discord username and your favorite FF game. Hope to hear from you all soon!",

I'm Techno, I'm 19 and Live in NZ (for anyone wanting to know my timezone)  \n\n\nI have a heap of ideas, some pertaining to things like Fallout and other such things. I've always been unsure how to write these things but I hope that I can come across as someone keen to rp if you'd be interested to look at my ideas. I've been roleplaying for quite a few years but I'm not one that writes paragraphs upon paragraphs, unless I need to. Most of my ideas are ones I came up with and quite a few ideas are my own, I know I can be a bit stubborn or picky, but I just have all these ideas and nobody to do them with. I will say I'm autistic so I can sometimes be stubborn, I'm looking for people who are open minded, possibly open to my ideas, decent grammar and detail and can tell me if I'm doing something wrong, I'm just tired of people unadding me without a chance of me resolving the situation.  \n\n\nPlease PM me and I'll send you my Discord tag or even discuss things, please know my tag has been known to not work sometimes, I don't know why, it just doesn't  \n\n\nHope to hear from you soon",

            "selftext": "*Once, long ago, a legendary Golden Age ruled the skies. But following the return of the Titans and the subsequent demolition of Mount Olympus, there settled an uncanny presence over the dimension. The Olympians were defeated, Zeus was, after a thousand lifetimes of feats, finally overpowered\u2014 but something remained. Brewing in the bellies of thirteen women scattered across Earth was a celestial presence, each bearing a distinctive powerful energy in its own right. Nine months after their conception, these omnipresent entities, along with all the other Gods within the pantheon, would be born into the world as a reincarnation of their former selves, fated to discover their true identities and return to Olympus. All unless something or someone stood in their way.\n\nSeemingly upon providence, the city of Olympia, California was built and established over centuries, located in place of what would be known to another universe as Los Angeles. And, with the passage of time, it proved to be the true city of dreams; the city not of angels, but of new gods. Now, as carved into stone, all paths of our fallen would lead here. January 1997.*\n\n**New Gods** is an original, fantasy role playing game with a throwback twist, bringing elements from Greek Mythology into the contemporary world of the 1990\u2019s. Set in a city/county based on Los Angeles, California (here known as Olympia, California), New Gods combines a world of seedy, heavy, fast-paced West coast life and core Greek mythological credo to create a surreal, dream-like story. Inspired by dark, subversive cult classics of the late 90\u2019s and early 00\u2019s (Fight Club, Donnie Darko, Lost Highway, Dark City and The Matrix), the 90\u2019s trend of taking classic, romantic literature and adapting it for the cynical, disaffected \u201cMTV Generation\u201d (Romeo + Juliet), modern fantasy series (American Gods, Lucifer, The Leftovers, Sense8, Westworld and Lost), and the work of Neil Gaiman (The Sandman).\n\nOur community is for adult writers looking to foster long-term character development through leisurely paced storytelling. Immortalize yourself with our exclusively 90's face claims as icons like Leonardo DiCaprio, Drew Barrymore, Mark Wahlberg, Winona Ryder, Johnny Depp, Freddie Prinze Jr., Nicole Kidman, Tom Cruise, Will Smith, Nia Long, Devon Sawa, Keanu Reeves, Rose McGowan, Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt, Alicia Silverstone and more!

I'm looking for someone 21 or older to RP with since, frankly, RPing with anyone younger is illegal if you catch my drift.\n\nI need someone who doesn't censor themselves because my characters curse like a sailor, violence never has a filter, and romance isn't dead. That being said, Stephen King is my muse so if you don't like his writing style please move on because I write almost exactly like him.\n\nI require you to be literate. Please. Misspells are totes okay cause I rp on my phone and my phone thinks it's funny to make me spell things like a toddler, but grammatical mistakes and lack of description will be a major no-go for me.\n\nI'm looking for someone who RPs fandoms. No OCs please! **PLEASE BE CAUGHT UP WITH ANY FANDOM YOU CONTACT ME WITH!!** Please be willing to play both female and male characters! Playing multiple characters of multiple genders is something I'd prefer both parties to be able to do! :)\n\nPlease PM me what Fandom you wanna RP! This will be RPed over Discord. I am a full time College student and a Full-time worker so I'm usually not busy after work or on the weekend.\n\nCan't wait to hear from you!\n\n-- Kire",

Some time later i am at the place... i'm ready... i wish that i could have a life where i can be happy and have friends...\n\nYes the plot isn't really happy but i like this idea :) and so when i would end it i would open my eyes but i would be somewhere else :)\n\nSo that is all for the plot if you want we could brainstorm on some things :)\n\nI hope i'll see someone interested :)\n\nBye :D",

            "selftext": " \n\nEleanor paused and looked up from her reading, that was an odd noise coming from right outside her door, it sounded as if someone was tapping on it. She pondered the cause and then went back to reading, it was an old house, old houses like that make noises. Then it came again, but a bit louder this time like someone was trying to get her attention, but that couldn\u2019t be, it was the middle of the night, no one should have been up and if they were then why\u2026? Eleanor marked her page and stood from her seat. She crept as slowly as she could over the wooden floor, shuffling her stocking feet so that she wouldn\u2019t make a sound. Nell wrapped her hand gently around the handle of the door, a sudden fear taking hold of her chest as she did. She slowly turned the knob, hearing the soft click as she pushed open the door. The noise came again but further down the hallway on one of her students doors after a few seconds it came again, just a bit louder than it had been before. Nell summoned up all her courage and pushed the door open. She peered down the hall only to see\u2026 Nothing? \n\nIt was a new place, Eleanor was just being paranoid. No one wanted their governess saying their house was haunted and scaring the children out of their minds. All the talk of *ghosts* and *spiritualists* her employer had been doing wasn\u2019t helping her out too much either, it was 1847 for god's sake*,* people should know better than to believe in ghosts. But to her dismay they had brought in an eager young spiritualist that wanted to find, and \u2018*communicate\u2019* with the supposed haunt that resided along with them in their home. Nell resigned herself to saying nothing once the man had arrived. It wasn\u2019t her place to even if she thought none of this would come out to anything.\n\nThe day came and the investigator arrived and Nell was the first to greet him. He looked kind enough but she still didn\u2019t trust all this ghost business. Mr. Henry, her employer sat the man down and told them of the problems the family had been experiencing ever since they had moved into the house, having the governess tell stories of her experiences to further the authenticity of the claims. She was less than pleased. \n\nThough there was a short break in the conversation as Mrs. Henry left the room for tea. Nell spoke up a bit. \n\n\u201cWhat evidence have you found that life after this life exists? Are you just intrigued or have you had things like this happen to yourself?\u201d \n\n\\-------------\n\nHello! \n\nThank you for reading this! \n\nThis will be a bit like The Haunting Of Hill House by Shirley Jackson. Where there are odd happenings going on in the house and someone sets out to find out the cause of these happenings. So if you\u2019re into the paranormal and a bit of a dark story this could be for you!\n\nIf you could please send me a message in the form of a reply to the above prompt that would be awesome. It\u2019s just so I can get to know your character and your writing style a bit before we begin.\n\nThank you!",

            "selftext": "# It is a dark time for the galaxy. After years of uneasy peace between the forces of the GALACTIC REPUBLIC and SITH EMPIRE, open war has once again begun between the two factions. The villainous SITH EMPIRE has taken advantage of the Republic\u2019s momentary weakness. Sith forces quickly spread through the galaxy, seizing control of planets once held by the GALACTIC REPUBLIC.\n\n# Meanwhile, the seemingly unstoppable JEDI ORDER is at its weakest point since the SACKING OF CORUSCANT, and the vile Sith have taken it upon themselves to wipe the Jedi from the galaxy once and for all. Now, we join one of those Sith warriors whose mission is to hunt down any Jedi traveling to the front lines of the war, and stop them from ever reaching their destination...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cMy lord, we\u2019re approaching the coordinates of the Republic cruiser.\u201d A crisp, male voice said, his eyes maintained on the various screens of the Fury-class Imperial Interceptor.\n\n\u201cVery good, Captain. As soon as the ship is in range, take out their shield generators, and as many turrets as possible before making a landing in their hanger bay.\u201d A rougher male voice said. The Sith Lord stared out of the viewport into the blue hugh of hyperspace for another moment before pressing a button the armrest console of the Captain\u2019s chair in the cockpit of the interceptor. \u201cCorprel, have your men ready to board. As soon as we land inside I want every Republic trooper killed. Anyone who surrenders take into custody.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir. Right away.\u201d Another voice came through the comlink system. The Imperial corporal turned to the troopers around him, all dawning the markings of an elite commando regiment within the Imperial army. \u201cYou know the drill, boys. Bag em and tag em.\u201d He said, raising his blaster rifle with a smirk on his face. The men in this squad had run missions like this for months, taking out small groups of Republic reinforcements before they could reach the front lines. They let [Darth Tal](https://imgur.com/jFVnZoG) have fun with any Jedi on board the ships, but if they had to, each trooper was specially trained to fight off a Jedi.\n\nThe Interceptor burst from hyperspace, a Republic Thranta-class corvette filling the viewport. The crew of the Sith vessel sprang into action, manning the weapons systems and activating the shields as it quickly flew towards the unsuspecting cruiser. In a flash of laser fire and missiles, the enemy shield generators were destroyed, along with a few of the turrets. With another pass the Interceptor landed in the hanger bay of the corvette.\n\nRepublic forces scrambled, caught off guard by the sudden and swift attack. Aboard the ship was [Jedi Master Evir Kanu](https://imgur.com/ZnIZUPW), and his padawan learner, [Menka Keller](https://imgur.com/e6gPU4l). Master Kanu quickly sprang into action, ordering two squads of Republic troopers to defend the hanger bay. He organized defenses throughout the ship until the bridge where he and his padawan stood. \u201cMenka, I need you to go with the troopers. If the enemy gets past the hanger and into the rest of the ship, they must be stopped before they reach the bridge.\u201d He said, a care and warmth to his tone, but cold hard determination and drive in his eyes. The Jedi Master would not let this ship and its supplies be taken easily.\n\nThe Imperial Commandos stood just inside the boarding area of the Interceptor, bathed in red light as they awaited the signal to enter the hanger bay. As soon as the light in the room turned green, the corporal lifted his head, \u201cLet em have it!\u201d With that, the door of the Interceptor slid open, followed by two smoke grenades. The Republic troopers were blinded for a split second, long enough for the Commandos to file out and into the hanger, flanking the enemy troopers on three sides.\n\nBefore they had time to react, the Imperial\u2019s opened fire. The Republic troopers fell like dominoes as they were filled with laser blasts. As the battle was happening in the hanger, Darth Tal sat in the Captain\u2019s chair of his ship, his eyes closed as he reached out through the Force, feeling each life of a Republic trooper be snuffed out one by one. When the last life was finally gone, he stood up and took hold of the metal helmet beside him. \u201cI sense the power of a Jedi Master.\u201d He said aloud as he placed the [helmet on his head](https://imgur.com/4u5p9Jd), completely covering it and masking his voice.\n\nThe Sith stepped onto the floor of the hanger, surveying the carnage his commandos had inflicted. \u201cYou\u2019ve done well, as usual, Corprel. Have your men spread out, we will take this vessel slow and methodical.\u201d Tal said as he continued walking to the hanger exist doors. The Corporal nodded and ordered his men around before rejoining the Sith. \u201cI assume we\u2019re heading for the bridge, sir?\u201d He asked, stepping over the body of a Republic soldier. \u201cYes, your men are going to cut us a path right to the Jedi.\u201d\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nHello there, I hoped you enjoyed that little Old Republic prompt. It sets the opening scene pretty well, but still leaves the characters a bit open to flesh out. For this story, I\u2019d be playing Darth Tal, and you Menka Keller. Ideally I\u2019d want this scene to play out with Tal finding Menka as she tries to defend the ship. She attempts to fight him, but is quickly defeated. Instead of killing the padawan, however, Tal has her cuffed as he senses something special inside of her, and something that he can exploit to turn her to the dark side and make her his Sith apprentice. You can decide whatever personality you want her to have, whether she\u2019ll be a young and innocent Jedi padawan who\u2019s just discovering the Force, an experienced Padawan with determination and no fear of the dark side, or somewhere in between.\n\nI\u2019d like for this to be a long term story, with not only a transformation to the dark side for Menka, but also a \u201cromantic\u201d relationship formed between Sith Master and apprentice. This can get as NSFW as you\u2019d like, or not. That part is up to you. If you\u2019re interested in this story shoot me an orange envelope and introduce yourself!",

You can call me Rockets, and as you can likely guess from the title of this post, I'm looking for some partners to hopefully roleplay some Detroit with.\n\nMy only requirement is that you're a literate roleplayer. I prefer 3-6 paragraphs per response, and I'd ideally like somebody in that same range. Two paragraphs would be the absolute minimum. I don't plan on, like, forcing somebody to write more, just... something to keep in mind.\n\nI would prefer to play as Connor or Gavin, but I have some other characters I write, and I'm pretty flexible! Also very flexible whenever it comes to ships, so if you've got somebody you like to pair off with one of them, let's go for it! The only thing I'd ask there is that you be 18+ if you're interested in roleplaying anything NSFW (which I am down for if you are, just saying.)\n\nIf you're interested in maybe working something out, send me a message! I mostly roleplay on Discord, but I can work with you on that for sure. Thanks for reading, and I look forward to hopefully RPing with you. :)",

That means I am very busy: there will be days when my brain will be fried and served with pickles. This introduction seems a bit repetitive, I know, but it is as accurate as can be right now.\n\nIf you add my frequent pauses and bouts of grief to the above, you will see why I'm looking for writing buddies who understand that I am not able to deliver novella type posts. For me, a writer can describe feelings and actions in a few words, and this is what I seek right now. Meaningful but laid back realism, having fun, being able to relax. I can only write in Fandom settings because I no longer have the time to come up with something of my own, sorry about that!\n\nPlease be at least over 18, because mature themes will surely arise: not as a form of compulsion, but as an organic part of the story.\n\nAdult women are what I am looking to play at the moment, in MxF relationships. Romance and Drama are vital for me, as moving, evolving character studies of some sort. I am not interested in Anime or Furry, sorry about that.\n\n1. Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nI got into it very recently and would love to learn and explore various ideas and AUs. I would love to play against Steve Rogers, Thor, Dr. Strange, and Iron Man, though the list is not exhaustive.\n\nHit me up with ideas, plots, cravings, pairings you might have in mind. I have nothing set in stone and enjoy the planning phase of a story the most. :)  \n\n\nAU friendly!  \n\n\nThanks for reading all this and I hope to hear from you soon!",

            "selftext": "In Massachusetts there resides an ordinary town, with a not so ordinary school. Blackwood High School, a school that was originally built for a wealthy businessman, had been renovated into a high school during the 1940s. The school is rumored to be haunted, but it seems the haunting only ever happened on the third floor. Faces and silhouettes are said to be seen in the windows of the third floor. The rumored third floor had been blocked off since the 1940 renovations and not a soul has been up there since. It was the end of May, 2004 when another bought of renovations took place. The barricades of thick would were removed and construction on the third floor started swiftly before summer break took place. The third floor, now being renovated so more classrooms could be added to the ever-growing student body, brought forth students to investigate the uncharted halls and rooms. On a Friday after classes let out, a number of students quietly ventured up to the third floor. Among those students were the few that would unravel the mystery that hid behind the buildings brick fa\u00e7ade.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRules:\n\n\u2022\tMust be 18+. I know it might sound weird for an RP to be restricted to only those who are above 18 when the character\u2019s themselves are either 18 or on the cusp of 18. The age restriction is mainly due to the fact that there will be a few dark concepts within the plot of the story that I\u2019m not comfortable with letting minors read.\n\n\u2022\tOnce the RP gets going try to at least post once a week.\n\n\u2022\tThis RP will be a community that welcomes LGBTQIA members and if you don\u2019t think you can be welcoming to them then this server is not the one for you\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReposting because life got a bit busy for a few and we are in need of more players!

            "selftext": "Hello again, I have a couple of scenes I would like to try out if someone is interested in them. I preferred to RP on kik but discord is an option too. Here are some scenes I have in mind.\n\n\nStar Wars: Now I have a scene in Star Wars that does not follow canon at all but if it doesn\u2019t interest you, but Star Wars does, I am willing to do another RP.\n\nThe year is 1145 BBA (Before the battle of Alderaan), the Sith and the Jedi are at a lasting agreement to work together for the betterment of the galaxy. But the Galaxy is divulged in a civil war between two factions, The Galatic Republic Federation (GRF), and the Clans of Mandalore forming the United Mandalorian Empire (UME). The Mandalorian House Zenla lead by Clan Morrax started to spread its empire throughout the galaxy conquering the northern part of the Inner Rim. The Ruler of this Empire, Serona Morrax, an innocent but now corrupt ruler from the disappearance of her daughter. The Galatic Republic Federation ruled by both Master Falenzo and Chancellor Mazendi, Protecting the galaxy with their mighty republic forces. Covering the deep core to most of the outer rim, the Galactic Republic Federation brings commerce to many worlds protected under it. The new Sidi order has been split up between the UME and the GRF following their homeland and family motives.\n\n\nSubnautica: I was thinking about this a lot over the past couple days and I would like to say that it is interesting for a duel survival RP, but I don\u2019t know how long it would last at all. Now even if we don\u2019t do Subnautica, a survival RP does sound pretty cool.\n\n\nFantasy Ancient Rome RP: I\u2019ve been thinking about this one a lot as it is probably my favorite cause I am a nerd on Roman history. I\u2019ll explain factions, we can RP in the middle of the Roman Empire or the middle of the Roman Republic, and we don\u2019t have to follow history.\n\nIt\u2019s (insert Roman history time) of the Roman (empire/republic). To the north of Rome are three factions. Gaul, home of the dwarfs and their smithing and fighting. Germanic tribes, home of the orcs and their barbaric ways. Britannia, home of the wood elves. To the east of Rome is 4 factions. Greek states, sophisticated elves. Getae tribes: goblins, Scythia Centaurs, and the dark elves of Persia and Egypt. Last but not least is the demons to the south. Will the Roman Empire win its conquest or face total destruction.\n\n\nFor honor: This last one I had in mind might be a stretch. I wanted to do a fantasy RP where it is like for honor with all these races and factions being very close to each other. But maybe these factions will include More type of cultures and their warriors. Maybe like Aztecs, Mongols, etc. \n\nIf any of these RPs interest you don\u2019t be afraid to message.\n\nCheers!",

But I get it, we just kinda dragged everything out and started running out of ideas for little stuff, but this time around I'll keep that from happening. I have a little prompt I'll put up down below, but just a few things first. \n\nI'm okay with a couple darker themes and while this is supposed to be a slice of life thing, I have no problem with your character having past addiction/abuse problems, or maybe a developing drug problem because their life is so stressful with how little they have going for them. You get the point I'm trying to make, so I'll set up the prompt and we'll go from there. \n\n\n*Another morning in this run down old apartment that Cecil, or as her fans come to know her, Chrystal, finds herself waking up in. She slowly stands from the single mattress on the floor and makes her to the cramped bathroom across the small, messy room she calls an apartment. She looks herself in the mirror, finding that she's only wearing her underwear, and brushes out her light blue hair. Once she's cleaned herself up a little bit, she hears the one she shares the apartment with stirring and looks over at her less feminine lover starting to wake up. \"About time, you're supposed to wake up first.\"*\n\nHopefully that's a decent starter, it is pretty old. Anyway, I'll be waiting.",

            "selftext": "Welcome to the world of Smash!\n\nNintendo Reborn is a large-scale, literate/semi-lit, long-term roleplay that has been going on for about a year now. It follows the adventures of the Super Smash Bros and the trials and tribulations they face on a daily basis, culminating in events of World of Light. The roleplay itself features canon and non-canon characters from MANY Nintendo games, or just games that have been on multiple Nintendo consoles. It was founded on Amino on June 14th, 2018, and moved to Discord on May 11th, 2019.\n\nNintendo Reborn itself follows a simplified, D&amp;D inspired battle system, with fighting and occasional actions being decided by the roll of the dice. No stat sheets here - just roll 2d6 to fight, jump, run, sneak, or simply look around. If someone tries to make life difficult for you, roll 1d6 to try and push through it.\n\nIn-game, the teleportation devices between Smashville, in the Animalia Commonwealth, and the Midair Stadium, in the World of Trophies, have stopped working. A crocodile-shaped spaceship has descended from the sky, and has opened fire on Smashville. The Smash Organization\u2019s shields protect the town for now, but they will not hold forever. A boarding party, led by Meta Knight, has formed to break into this spaceship and confront the enigmatic \u201cKaptain\u201d. \n\nMeanwhile, in the blissfully unaware World of Trophies, Yuusha, the Luminary, is subjected to an initiation for Assist Trophies, all parties unaware of the destiny ahead of him. This initiation comes in the form of a low-stakes tournament, where Yuusha participates as an Assist Trophy for the contestants to ally with. Some of the fighters, like Roy, Marquess of Pharae, and Pac-Man, the ancient bane of ghosts, take this event with levity. But some of the other participants feel self-doubts and resentment bubble in their hearts as they are eliminated one by one.\n\nFair warning:\nThis roleplay can occasionally contain dark themes, drama, and slight gore. People will be badly hurt physically and emotionally, be mind-controlled, and potentially suffer PTSD. On the brighter side, due to how characters can be interpreted, shipping is also possible.\n\nWe are looking to fill the canon, non-DLC roster of 76 fighters for a major story event happening this holiday season. Other, non-fighter characters are also available, and we encourage doubling or even tripling up.\n\nWant to join? PM me either here or on Discord at Sathoren#8147, and we\u2019ll discuss how to get you into the action as quickly as possible!\n\nThe members of Nintendo Reborn also occasionally do online matches in SSBU, and give out tips every once in a while. Like playing games AND roleplaying? Great! We\u2019re almost always open for a match or two!",

I\u2019m a 23 year old female residing on the west coast of the United States and am searching for someone to write with.\n\nA bit about me; I am coming back from a hiatus on RP. I\u2019m still relatively novice to it, but I\u2019m a literate and well versed writer. I will only RP with persons over 18. I prefer a partner that is literate as well. I write third person exclusively and prefer past tense.  I am not going to hold someone to post length requirements, or ruthless grammar requirements, but I need enough to work with and to be able to understand what you\u2019re writing. I typically can do 2-5 paragraphs in a reply, depending on what the situation is. \n\nIm really looking for a slice of life filled with drama, romance and depth. I\u2019ll consider adding possible sci-fi/fantasy/horror elements but I really want the SOL theme to be centric. Just two characters  living the struggles and successes of life. \n\nI\u2019m not comfortable writing fandoms, so I prefer OC and original worlds. I find world and character building to be a super fun part of the process. That said, I will note that I am one for processing and building a roleplay before jumping into it. I find it flows better for me that way when it comes time to actually write. \n\nIf this interests you, go ahead and send me a message with a little about you and what you\u2019re looking for in a partner. I\u2019m up for negotiating platforms. :)",

I'm pretty familiar with comics (I've read quite a bit), but I base most of my characters off of whatever show/movie they're in. I've been roleplaying for about 8 years now, and writing is one of my passions! Now, let's get down to business. :)\n\nSome characters I play (and who I would be looking for to ship them with):\n\nWanda Maximoff (Vision preferably, Steve Rogers, Stephen Strange, Bucky Barnes, Natasha Romanoff, Carol Danvers, and maybe a couple others. I main her so she\u2019s usually my go to and preferred).\n\nKaren Page (Frank Castle and Matt Murdock).\n\nElektra Natchios (Matt Murdock).\n\nJean Grey (Scott Summers).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a pretty simple woman, but I do have some rules:\n\n1. NO OCs! Please only contact me if you want to play a CANON character and please adhere to how the character acts and speaks. I don't want someone who plays Vision to act like a normal man. He's a robot, he's gonna be a little awkward!\n2. Please have correct grammar, punctuation, etc. and be willing to write more than one or two sentences, depending on what is happening. I'm fine with shorter responses, but only if there is a good amount of detail in it!\n3. I like to do pretty NSFW stuff, so please be a little bit older and mature. If you're not comfortable with that but still want to rp, please just tell me! I'll be fine without NSFW material.\n4. Please keep everything in 3rd person pov. Nothing bothers me more than someone writing in 1st person pov.\n\nIf you want to roleplay with me, please message me and I'll be more than happy to give you my Kik, Discord, Tumblr, email, etc.!\n\nThank you for taking your time out of your day to read this!",

Please DM if interested \n\nLooking for: 21+ detailed writers with a good grasp of prose and grammar who are interested in character driven roleplays with complex and dynamic m// relationships. Someone who has their own ideas to bring to the table and is active but doesn't require multiple responses per day\n\nI. Modern, fame, psychological, toxic relationships\nA sophisticated and ruthless music manager [my character] plays a key role in transforming a musician/actor into a man worthy of the world stage--and also has a starring role in the hurricane of his personal life as success and money begins to pour like water. I'd like to explore the friction, triumphs, and toxicity of a symbiotic relationship between a musician/actor and his manager throughout their careers. Inspired by Rocketman.\n\nII. Post-apocalyptic, supernatural, horror, love in dark places\nA cataclysmic event has turned the world into a post-apocalyptic ground zero where monsters (can be akin to vampires, shifters, eldritch abominations) are now the top of the food chain. A loner [my character] who finally finds fragile peace with a duo of strangers becomes trapped by guilt when he indirectly sets events into motion that results in the death of one of the group and the turning of the other. Your character can either be the person who was turned, someone he finds after these events, or a monster.\n\nIII. Cyberpunk, sci-fi, psychological, military, body horror\nA super soldier at the height of his career is heavily injured in a freak accident during a test run for a new experimental technology. His long time partner [my character] makes the call to approve fitting him with an extensive array of cybernetics in order to save his life despite knowing he is extremely against being altered. Recovery results in horrifying changes in body and mind beyond what either could have anticipated -- and later on, they discover that the accident might not have been an accident after all",

As stated in the title, I\u2019m  looking to do a high fantasy medieval based rp. I\u2019ll summarise the plot here, but I won\u2019t go into too much detail. The basic idea of this rp is that a righteous character has to team up with one of the \u201cvillains\u201d the kingdom has locked up in solitary, purely because they have no other choice. \n\nThe basic idea of this is that Caelum, the deity of the heavens and sky, wants to cleanse the universe - reset it. Remake everything to his benefit. This would mean the complete extinction of everyone, including all the realms. \n\nYour character, trusted by the king of the kingdom of earth, has stepped up to stop Caelum, but she can\u2019t do it alone. The king takes her through passages of the castle she never even knew about, down to the darkest dungeons. Behind multiple corridors, chains, and bolted doors lies a prisoner forgotten about for years. Anemos - a son of Caelum. Half human, half deity. He\u2019s a troublemaker. There are many stories of him doing awful things to the kingdom and the realms. However, despite this, he\u2019s the only one who is able to help. He knows more about his father than anyone. Besides, the kingdom would be much better if he was to die out there anyway. \n\nAnemos and your character must venture out to fight of the deity that is Caelum, all whilst trying to keep Anemos under control. \n\nThere\u2019s a lot to this plot that I haven\u2019t written down here, but will be revealed in DMs if you\u2019re interested.\n\nI hope to hear from you soon!",

            "selftext": "Thousands of years ago, a malfunctioning warp drive sent a colony ship to a far off galaxy named Geminon, leaving them cut off from Earth. Over the years this colony grew and splintered into several civilisations, with different motivations and beliefs. These groups grew and ventured to new planets, creating multiple civilisations across several hundred planets within their new known galaxy.\nYour faction, your people, are the vast and impenetrable Empire of the Holy Monarchy. Operating from Planet Bozidan, God King Hadrian rules in his eternal omnipotence. His word marks every decision and carves out the Holy Law. Their colonialist expansion and religious dogma has spread too thin and created friction within the Empire; Separatist splinter cells harass the borders of their terrain, hellbent on disrupting the system or dismantling the monarchy entirely.\n\nIt is for this reason that the Imperial Navy is such a vast and expansive military force within the faction. However, Grand Admiral Absolom is not your typical zealot; he is cold, calculated and tactical at every turn. He saw the growing threat of individuals, called \u2018The Marked\u2019, chosen in secret by a pantheon of quarreling deities to work their bidding amongst mortal men, and decided that something would have to be done. He ordered the formation of a paramilitary crew, which you have been invited to join, composed entirely of Marked but loyal members of the Empire, to seek out and destroy the spread of the Marked Ones before their powers become publicised - and weaponised.\n\nThe gods are numerous; there are hundreds that each have different domains, and different motivations. Some are more power hungry and actively gather more followers than others. The gods must follow universal rules that must not be broken, or suffer cosmic consequences. For example they cannot kill directly; they must influence others if they wish a being to die. They have many ways to influence humans, from portentous dreams, to physical manifestations of their beings, and - in the rarest cases - the carving of their holy sigil onto the person\u2019s flesh, granting them an infinitesimal slice of their own supernatural abilities. Whilst many believe in gods, their existence is known by very few, and even fewer know that they have their own motivations.",

            "selftext": "Hello there friends!\n\nI am currently searching for long term RP partners for some interesting RPs.\n\nA little bit about me:\n\nI am a 20 year old female with about 7 or 8 years of experience and even longer writing experience (~9 or 10). \n\nEST time zone\n\nI RP third person and my responses range anywhere from a paragraph to even a page depending on what is happening in the RP.  (I also do try to match responses) \n\nIf for some reason you grow bored or disinterested please do let me know and we can fix it or try something else completely. \n\nI love chatting outside of RP whether it be about our characters, future plot points, coming up with characters in AU\u2019s or just general chat! Although if that\u2019s not your thing then no worries!\n\nI do have a full time job and have responsibilities after so my responses may be dependent but I do try to get out a response every day at least. I will let you know if I disappear for longer of course! \n\nFor fandom RPs, I can do canon and OC characters (although I am more used to canon), and I can play both males and females. I also love to RP multiple characters (more plot devices and interaction that way after all!) Character interaction, development, and world building is a must! I love building things to it\u2019s full potential. \n\nAlso, I do quite enjoy looking at characters from different angles even if that means switching between character POV in the RP, but if you\u2019re more of a one or two character interaction type of person that\u2019s fine, but I certainly don\u2019t mind playing side characters or extras to bring the world to life.\n\nSome games I have played: (I am perfectly fine to play against an OC for any of these!) \n\nI will put asterisks next to ones I am inspired for or that I know the most about.\n\nUndertale\n\nDetroit: Become Human *** \n\u2014&gt; I can play any of the canon characters but at the moment I am most interested in a Gavin and RK900, and I could settle for anything with Hank and Connor even including an OC if you preferred as well. \n\nSpider-Man (PS4 2018) \n\u2014&gt; Canon\n\nFinal Fantasy (4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10-2, 13, 13-2, 13-3, 15 and Kingsglaive, Dissidia, Crisis Core) \n\u2014&gt; I can play any of the canon characters from these as well! \n\nTales (Berseria, Xillia, and Graces f) \n\nLegend of Zelda (MM, TP, WW, SS, BOTW) **\n\u2014&gt; Canon or OC\n\nTelltales The Walking Dead \n\nFire Emblem (Awakening, Warriors, Fates)\n\u2014&gt; Almost any of the canon\n\n\n\nShows/movies:\n\nMarvel\n\u2014&gt; most movies including Spiderverse and also daredevil, not so much comics \n\nSherlock * \n\u2014&gt; Canon\n\nMiraculous LB *\n\u2014&gt; Canon or OC \n\nRWBY * \n\u2014&gt; Canon or OC \n\nSword Art Online Arc 1 &amp; 2 (more the universe)\n\nSword Art Online Season 2 (more the universe)\n\nThe Seven Deadly Sins\n\n\n\n\nBooks:\n\nPercy Jackson\nThe Chronicles Of Nick\nWarriors\nMaximum Ride\nAntigoddess *\nBeautiful Creatures\n\n\n\nOriginal ideas I enjoy:\n\n\u2014Fantasy (medieval, magical elements, kingdoms, different races, even adding in tech like airships, modern weapons, and exploring more than one and a variety of aspects as well. There\u2019s so much more I could add but it would take forever.)\n\u2014\u2014&gt; war themes, royal themes, different aspects of life themes\n\n\u2014Romance (MxF and possibly FxF and I don\u2019t do smut. More of a fade to black sort of person) I also thoroughly enjoy building it up over time rather than it simply happening! \n\n\u2014Action/Adventure\n\n\u2014Angst/Drama\n\nI am sure there are more things I am forgetting. \n\nI would be fine exploring any other sorts of themes/plots genres except Sci-Fi and Slice of life (normal themes would need some convincing as I find it difficult to keep it going) as I like some sort of magical or fictional aspect to it. \n\nIf you have any other suggestions/ideas/plots/settings as to what you would like to do then please shoot me a PM with a bit about you and your interests and we can discuss! Give me a bit about your interests and preferences! I am open to nearly anything!\n\nIf you need a sample of my writing, please do not be afraid to ask! \n\nMy platforms are Kik, Discord, Skype, Email, Google Docs and Reddit PM\n\nThank you and I hope to hear from you soon!

Preferably after the events of Wild Hunt but I can write pre-game rps too. My character would be a young witcher from the school of cat who travels with his sister (either a female witcher or a mage) and has been on the trail for a short time. He lands a strix contract that ends with a disaster.\n\n\u2022 I also have some original ideas, especially for fantasy (exiled prince, rebel leaders, monster hunters, the list goes on...)\n\nI love worldbuilding and ooc chatter, and I also have an affinity for sharing a lot of pictures of my bunny.

Needless to say, lots of changes are coming.\n\nDuke it out with Epoch Pharmaceuticals' gallery of unstable scientists and scheming corporate suits.

            "selftext": "Okay, so this ad is gonna be a bit more specific than I've posted in the past, but I'm searching for a roleplay based in the World of Warcraft universe, specifically set in a more recent timeline. \n\nThe ideal RP would be between Anduin and Wrathion, exploring their relationship after everything that happened after Pandaria, specifically Wrathion betraying Anduin. After the long years since then, with Anduin now king of Stormwind, I'm looking to do semi-original roleplay, where Wrathion returns, seeking aid from Stormwind.\n\nWhile that's the ideal RP, I'd be open to people playing other characters, or to even do an original WoW roleplay, I have a bunch of different characters to do an OCxOC roleplay, so either is fine.\n\nThe main gist of the RPs will be a focus on adventure and stuff like that, and while I'm open to NSFW stuff within the roleplay, I'd like to focus on the story that we'll come up with.\n\nI'm a 21 year old uni student, in the GMT timezone, I've got a lot of free time since I've just finished for the summer, so I should be able to reply quite quickly. I'd appreciate it if anyone interested is over the age of 18 for obvious reasons.",

            "selftext": "Hey you, yes you, are you a woman that is a fan of horror, adventure, decent story telling and weaboos? One that enjoys romance, tragedy, and perhaps a smidgen too many mom jokes? Are you someone who enjoys discussing great, massive worlds and building them and the characters with someone before starting the grand adventure and seeing how it turns out? If that is the case, than I may be the partner you're looking for to enjoy crafting expansive, deep and thought provoking worlds, that just so happen to have a chihuahua puppy named \"Goreaff The Destroy\", because as much as I love my edge, smoothing it out with some witty and definitely at times cheesy humor is one of my favorite activities. Just because a world can be realistic or dark, doesn't mean you can't have a sense of humor. I also enjoy to use pictures and even music of reference, and enjoy it to be reciprocated. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow if any of this seems interesting or fun to you, I'll have a few prompts below to give you an idea of what I enjoy. If they pop out to you, hey we can talk about it and see where it goes. If you enjoy the concepts and have some of your own you'd like to share, feel free to do so. (But be warned I am a man, who is honest to a fault. And will both constructively criticize and tease relentlessly, just as much as I'll give tips and ideas, you have been warned.) I'm an adult, who enjoys adult themes(as I'll throw some of my favorite worlds and stories down below aswell.), so more dirty stuff is like to be brought up in the least, and I do enjoy smut in my RP's as much as I enjoy my cheesy romance. So keep that noted. I'm also willing to play characters or OC's, or even warp other worlds that we may both enjoy. This in the end of course is a call to someone who wants to do multiple RP's, not just one(Even though we'll focus one at a time usually, if not always). Even more importantly a good new friend for us both, whom we can just screw around and talk with about different subjects.(And I do mean it can be literally any different subject.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo without furthering the stage, here's some of my favorite stories/worlds. \n\n\\-The Witcher\n\n\\-A Song of Ice and Fire(Game of Thrones to the unaware)\n\n\\-Bloodborne\n\n\\-Naruto\n\n\\-Overlord\n\n\\-Percy Jackson(Basically RPG/Action Game Fromsoftware makes)\n\n\\-Supernatural\n\n\\-Devil May Cry\n\n\\-Aliens Vs Predator\n\n\\-Star Wars\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd now for some incredibly summarized versions of a few prompts I have in mind.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBlood of the Profane- You are known to most of the world as Alice(Ally) Helsing, a young British exchange student, who happens to be a huge bookworm who spends more time at the library with a horror novel in hand more often than a make up tutorial. Quiet, timid and curious of everything in America, at times a bit too curious for some people's comfort. To the underground network you are Alucard Tepes Vlad, youngest born of Dracula, the leader of the Seraphim, or blue bloods as the human's call you. Having been brought to our young city of Redhaven to learn how to lead and start a coven for a foothold in the area. Prideful, Intelligent and a bit brash, most of the city didn't have a care to accept that you were the alpha creature of the city due to your bloodline alone. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith all that said, there is trouble in paradise. The first is not all accepted your authority, the greatest foe against your rise being Victor Regis, the vampire who controlled the area prior to your coming. Bringing near half of your subjects with him due to your more peaceful style of ruling and conservative view of the amounts of blood you intake, along with how you take it. At the same time you have to worry about the powerful Templar Organization, Religion being far more prominent in the U.S., so are the warriors who hunt your kind down, with larger numbers and better weaponry than you'd have to deal with at home. Moreover it seems a  sudden appearance of an Remala, or black blood in human words, is hunting down your people indiscriminately, both those under Victor and yourself, and doing so quite proficiently. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis hurts your claim to being the Alpha of Redhaven, if the traitors didn't hurt that enough. When this Blackblood happens to be the same man you've been beginning a relationship with and the idea of a beast hiding within the city as powerful as your father comes to your knowledge, that is only certain to make things even more difficult for you. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDiscrepancy of Living- A young, middle class teen-aged(19) mother's life is usually not the easiest around. That stress skyrockets when you're stuck in the undead apocalypse. This isn't your average braincravers cataclysm however, sure when in the daylight most only walk around sounding like your younger Breaking Benjamin(Ember hype) loving brother at school, but at night it's like they watched the movie 28 days later, sprinting faster than your average man, able to tear off people apart(Okay they could do that before, but now it's faster!) and worse, some can even learn. And that's only in the Gray-Zones. With larger challenges ahead also comes better tools, The five percent of the population who are immune to the virus, while not driven mad, are also not kept the same either. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThose that are immune gain abilities(And often deformities). For instance, that man who's been helping you out since you met since the dawn of this cesspit? His muscle is denser, giving him great physical strength, though it also gives him the added benefit of needing to eat more(When food is already scarce), being hurt more when falling from normally small drops, and needing to blackout when he sleeps, at times for nearly half a day or more, where he is completely vulnerable. That's only one of many possible genetic changes, and not all those who have them stay sane or altruistic either. In a world where the virus constantly evolves, humanity needs to ask itself what living truly means. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nScarlet Thread of Two Dragons- Have you heard of the tale of The Red Thread? In Japanese myth it is an invisible red line tied on a finger of two people who are meant to be together, true loves, soul mates, prisoners to destiny because it must of been drunk when it tied us together! You are the heir to a previous Feudal Lord, and of The Dragon's Heritage, meaning you have the blood of your people's Goddess, a white and golden dragon. Which gives you the power of her holy flame, which when used can heal others from even fatal injuries, cure the blind and the diseased, and even make the most barren land bare fruit. You are both kind and wise for your age, so then, what's the problem?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Problem is I am a European knight who captured you in the quest to kill your Goddess and Ancestor. The blood of the Dragon's Heirs needing to be fresh on the blade to kill the beasts once and for all. I to was marked by a dragon, burned into me when he destroyed my home. Given great physical and destructive power. Though the mark stays hidden along with my visage in my onyx armor, due to the shame of it. Even worse is that the world in danger of collapsing unless we find out why with the dragon's. What will happen to the beasts, the world and us, is all hidden in this tale, and thread of destiny that binds us together. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo those are the prompts, if they sound great to you, give me a message. If they sound interesting to you and you have your own ideas, give me a message. Or if we just like the same type of stuff and you're interested in RPing, you know what to do. We can talk a bit over PM's and if we hit it off, I also have discord/skype we could share to make things easier for later. So if you read all the way down to this point, wow you're awesome, and I wish you a good day.",

            "selftext": "*...As the forest spoke softly to Torrga she whispered to the spirits that surrounded her. The Forests of the Cragskull Region were once the home of a mighty dwarven empire but now lay in ruin. Devastated by pillaging giants that came in to claim their land and run them out. The fiery maned dwarf woman was one of the last of the Frostbeard clan and even though she trained with her brothers, she was often seen as someone who needed to stay with clan. To raise little dwarves and to ensure the bloodline of the clan continues. But that never was this girls style. She acquired the ritualistic tattoos like her brother, she bore the mark of the Primal Ones, the Twin Bear Deities that protected her clan and she wasn't one to back away from a challenge. Being a Frostbeard dwarf came with a reputation for thriving in cold climates. While the tundra environment the clan lived in would keep away the weaker warm blooded races who lived further south, she was right at home in her minimal garb.* \n\n*Torrga was on the lookout for the remnants of a scouting party sent out to make sure Hope's Candle pass was still cleared of the giantkin. The news was likely grim, and the other Frostbeard council members knew they likely met with an untimely fate. They needed someone a bit quicker than the bulky stalwart Frostbeard men, so Torrga's athleticism won out yet again. As the woman raced along the sparse woods, quickly approached the treeline she knew the pass was about a half mile north of that point. She also knew that she would need to move a bit more stealthily after that point. The giants had ways to seek out her kind, and while her training under the spirit of the wolf have made her a bit more lithe in her movements, she could never outrun the long stride of most giants...* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is a bit of a sample, a small portion of the world I want to make. A world steeped in fantasy. A largely undeveloped world in which my partners have free reign to collaborate with me and create new and interesting characters from unique regions. Creatures and demons are abound and the only limit is your own imagination. I identify as a male, with the pronouns he/him. I live in EDT and I work in a corporate setting. I do have obligations outside my worklife so there may be times where I get busy, please be understanding. While I have had some mental breakdowns and have a strong opinion on my work I try to be as accommodating as possible. \n\nI am comfortable writing in the perspective of male or female and have no problem writing romance as the opposite gender. If you need to feel some form of romance in your writing, don't hesitate to bring it up to me, I am sure we can work it in. I am looking for someone who can keep with me and offer plenty of unique and amazing ideas. While this reddit account is new I have been roleplaying for over 20 years and have been a writer for almost as long. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am only interested in fantasy settings, and I am only interested in OCs. Please no fandoms, I don't mind if characters are inspired by a character you love from a series you love, but I want something unique, something that will be ours. I also write in the 3rd person past tense as shown in the blurb above. I don't demand a certain length but I do demand some form of effort. I will get bored if my 500-700 word reply is returned with a small paragraph. Because of this I don't mind if you take days to do your responses. We all have lives, and we all get busy, and I do enjoy OOC banter and love to have side conversations or to geek out about the story we are making, so if you need a friend as well as a writing partner I am your guy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith all this being said, I am looking forward to hearing from you, and thank you so much for making it this far. I suffer from anxiety and I have recently come out from a bit of a low point in my life. Not looking for sympathy just wanted to give motivation for trying to get out there and meet some folks.

            "selftext": " The Fantasy Sandbox is a collaborative, medieval-fantasy story writing and world-building game in which all players have an equal input to the story and its effectively crowdsourced setting. This creates a unique, community-designed but cohesive roleplaying world and experience that allows a vast number of different fantasy themes in one place. You can play as any character or race--a king, a knight, an adventurer, a petty criminal, a mastermind villain, a commoner, a wizard or mage, a dragon, a fairy, you name it, provided they are presented in a medieval fantasy theme. Every character has a unique role and contribution to the game. In this freeform roleplaying setup, players create all the civilizations, stories, characters, and world geography within a casual rule set that maintains balance. As a result, interwoven stories emerge. The game world depends on that very emergence and has been developing its identity from a completely blank slate over the course of two years.\n\nThere's no telling who of the many currently active characters you'll meet or where you'll go. Player-designed factions have formed kingdoms, player-written quests drive entire adventures, and politics shape the land.\n\nThis has always been an open community game. If you like to roleplay in medieval-fantasy themes, we invite you to join us in helping maintain our novel continuum alive with new characters, plots, and settings!\n\n[***http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/5/introduction***](http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/5/introduction)  \n[***https://discord.gg/cb5n63C***](https://discord.gg/cb5n63C)",
