            "selftext": "Hello, Hello!\n\nMy name is Kay, I'm 23 years old, and I'm looking for a literate roleplay partner to create characters and build a world together. I'm interested in fantasy, slice of life, supernatural, and the like. I've never done high fantasy, so I'm not sure about that, but I'm willing to try almost anything. I would like my partner to be older than 18, because I'm older than 18 and I'm not interested in roleplaying with someone way younger.\n\nMy preference is roleplaying as a woman, so I'm looking for someone (preferably a woman) to play a man, woman, or nonbinary character! I can vibe with almost anyone and any situation. I have a part-time job and go to school full-time, but it's summer and I have a little free time on my hands. I would like the person I roleplay with to be someone I can to get to know, be friends with, and really come to care about our characters. Otherwise, what's the point? If this sounds like you, please send me a message.\n\nI'm open to any and all ideas, so include something you'd like to roleplay in your message. That's a good conversation starter, plus it let's me know what you're looking for. Also, include a little something about yourself so I have some idea who I'm talking to. Anything with one word or one sentence will probably not get a response from me. Sorry!\n\nStill there? Still interested? Awesome! Shoot me a message here on reddit and I'll give out the best way to get in touch with me. Thanks in advance! :)",

            "selftext": "This is a trope I'm a big fan of. In some kind of post-apocalyptic scenario, or otherwise dangerous world, a tough, somewhat cold and serious man will team up with an innocent young girl, and over time become a sort of father figure. You've seen it in things like Logan, the Last of Us, Leon the Professional, and the Walking Dead game. I've been inspired to write about this after playing a rather obscure game called LISA. I never get tired of this dynamic, and I'd really like to play it out with someone.\n\nSo for the setting, we could go a few different ways. We could do a Fallout-esque post apocalyptic world. Or a medieval fantasy setting, emphasizing how deadly such a place would be. Or just our own world in a different time period, as I'm a big history buff. Whichever we decide on, I wouldn't mind setting aside some time to worldbuild first!\n\nMy exact character would depend on the setting we choose, but in general I'd like to play a gruff, hardened older man. Someone who's seen a lot of loss in his life, and has become a cynic and a harsh realist. I like the dynamic of our characters not getting along at first, but eventually bonding. You don't have to play a child necessarily, but I'd prefer if your character was younger than mine. You can make their personality whatever you want! Just be sure and tell me what angle you'd like to go with this. There could be some dark themes in this roleplay, so I'd prefer if you were open to that. But if there's any subject that's absolutely off-limits for you in an RP, please let me know. I want to make sure you're comfortable.\n\nAs for the RP itself, things like post length aren't a big deal for me. Short replies are more prudent sometimes, like with rapid back-and-forth dialogue, so it doesn't make sense to impose these arbitrary \"minimum word requirements\". Write as much as you think is necessary. If you're interested, please PM me! I'd prefer to play this out over Discord, but I'd rather talk it over a little bit before moving there. Hope to hear from y'all!",

With this chaos, the totalitarian, theonomic government of \u201cGilead\u201d establishes rule in the former United States in the aftermath of a civil war. Society is organized by power-hungry leaders along with a new, militarized, hierarchical regime of fanaticism and newly created social classes, in which women are brutally subjugated, and by law are not allowed to work, own property, handle money, or read. Worldwide infertility has resulted in the conscription of the few remaining fertile women in Gilead, called \u201cHandmaids\u201d, according to an extremist interpretation of a Biblical account. They are assigned to the homes of the ruling elite. \n\nAlongside the red-clad Handmaids, much of society is now grouped into classes that dictate their freedoms and duties. Women are divided into a small range of social categories, each one signified by a similarly-styled plain dress in a specific color: Handmaids wear red, Marthas (who are housekeepers and cooks) wear green, and Wives (who are expected to run their households) wear blue. Econowives, the lower-class women who still have minimal agency, are sort of a mixture of all these categories, and they wear gray. Women prisoners are called Carols and are worked to death clearing toxic waste. Another class of women, Aunts (who train and oversee the Handmaids), wear brown. Additionally, the Eyes are a secret police watching over the general populace for signs of rebellion, Hunters track down people attempting to flee the country, and Jezebels are prostitutes in secret brothels catering to the elite ruling class.\n\nThe people in Gilead have been living under this government for 10 years, and while some are completely content with their new positions in life, some are very unhappy (and rightfully so).

OCs from my experience have largely been hard to integrate into the story (no offense. It's my fault) and their power levels puts them at odds sometimes.\n\n[I quickly made a Wonder Woman character sheet as an example and we can work on the others who you'd like to play (Superman, Batman, etc.) in the story.](https://fatecharactersheet.com/character/fate-core/0b18bc1e-eea7-4744-a908-85b63af49f31/wonder-woman)\n\nI have an adventure in mind involving the Justice League/Trinity fighting Grodd, who's a telepath and brute when needed.\n\nI'd like to do this one to one or with two players (three sounds overwhelming, plus time and obligations) and will adapt accordingly (I might even play a character to help guide the story)\n\nIf anyone's interested, hit me a PM and have some super fun :)",

            "selftext": "Good evening there folks! Once upon a time, I used to frequent another thread as a GM! As of recent, I've been on something of a hiatus and was hoping to get back into things, perhaps at a different place! So, here I am, with nothing but time on my hands and the hopes that we can make up some kind of adventure to take up our time!\n\nThat being said, I'm more than happy to spin a tale on any of your favorite genres, though the ones that I tend to specialize in, or are at least most experienced in, are sci-fi and apocalyptic themes! Still, I hope that doesn't discourage you from pitching anything else! I'm more than happy to work with anyone in order to make a world together that we can both enjoy, as well as any story!\n\nOf course, I'm also open to \"borrowing\" the world of whatever your favorite fandom might be, with some sparse exceptions! Video games, books, movies, etc, just let me know and we'll see what we can do!\n\nAs for my preferences on things, I prefer my partner be mostly literate, (I'm not perfect either, of course! Just someone that grasp things well enough!) Over the age of 18, and understanding of schedules! I'll never be on to get upset if you have to go all of the sudden, though if you feel the need to cut things off, please let me know! \n\nLast topic to cover, I believe, is the possibility of smut occuring in the story! As stated above, I'm pretty familiar with it, and are totally fine with doing it at any level that you're comfortable with, or not at all! If need be, we can discuss those preferences, likes/ dislikes, etc later on!\n\nIf this interests you, please don't hesitate to shoot me a message! I'm taking on about as many as I can handle without sacrificing any attention to any of my potential partners!\n\nPlease, have a great day!",

I have done boss and secretary, girlfriend and boyfriend, best friends, roommates, etc. So we can brainstorm some ideas.\n\n3) Western- Maybe for this we can do something where we are both outlaws in different gangs.

I represent a Discord-based Roleplay group set in the Fallout Universe, specifically following the events of Fallout: New Vegas, and leading up to the prologue of Fallout 4. We\u2019re a group of friends looking for creative, inspiring new players to come and join our world, and contribute to the activity of the server as well as its ongoing story!\n\nWe\u2019re a group that welcomes all types of backgrounds for all types of characters, so long as it doesn't infringe with any lore already in the either the Server's established canon, or the canon of the Fallout games themselves. Our server contains just about every location and faction featured in a Fallout game, as well as some entirely new ones! All creativity is very much welcome; we even have a chat where players can contribute lore of their own to the world. We have no limit on word-count, so there\u2019s little pressure to keep up with your fellow members. In fact, there are little restrictions on writing style in general, save that we only ask that you keep your posts in third-person.\n\nFallout: Fault and Blame takes place six years following the Battle of Hoover Dam, with lore created and updated by our members to match the state of the wasteland during that time. We\u2019re always actively seeking new members to contribute to the lore with their ideas, so don't be afraid to let your creativity run wild! We also give players the option to play as either their own **original characters**, or **canon characters/NPCs** from the games themselves. We also allow your own, **personalised factions** to be brought together, via lore-submissions!\n\nCome check us out! We hope to hear from you soon.\n\n\\-[https://discord.gg/bQFfnM2](https://discord.gg/bQFfnM2)",

            "selftext": " \n\n**Rookshaven** is one of the longest running, lore-intensive group role playing storylines on Discord right now.\n\nBased in present-day northern Scotland, Rookshaven Academy and University is a school for mages, though the storyline only allows for university students and professors to be applied. We're about 30+ players strong!\n\n**A bit about our lore:**\n\nThe mage community has always held their royal families above the rest. Though they aren't considered kings or queens of their mage classes anymore, the royal families are believed to be the first blood lines to develop their particular kind of magics. As such, royalty have always been the law-makers for mages worldwide. In the late 1800s, a rebel sect of mages rose up to attack the royals and all of their complicit, loyal subjects - resulting in a Mage Civil War.\n\nMany mages and their royal families were killed off, while the beast mage class disappeared entirely. From that war, the High Council was formed. A collection of the remaining royal houses, electing one member of their family to represent them in the governing of the mage community.\n\nUnfortunately, out of the original eight royal families, only four are alive in present day. Additionally, two new mage classes have been discovered. Without a way to track the new class's lineage, Mythics and Necromancers have been left without a representative in the Council. As a result, many laws passed since their discovery have been created seemingly for the purpose of keeping Necromancers and Mythics at a disadvantage. While the newest class, Mythics, are sigil-bound at a young age to feel an automatic pull toward royal families, they often grow up to be employed as maids or servants for the royals.\n\nSince 2016, another uprising of rebels has been seen. Between then and 2019 (present day), many royals and loyalists alike have lost their lives in terrorist attacks by these Rebels. In the last year of the group story on Discord, students have been attacked both on and off campus, leading many to believe there are Rebels among the ranks of Rookshaven, despite the school being run by the Council.\n\nAs of January 1st, 2019, the light binding Royal family in its entirety was wiped out in an attack from a hybridized spell known as Shadow Fire.\n\n**What you can expect:**\n\n\\- Monthly events in which your character can earn points to put into their dice, making them stronger.\n\n\\- Lots of lore.\n\n\\- High Activity.\n\n\\- Outlined mage classes, as well as factions to push their own agendas (Royals, Loyalists, Rebels, Sympathizers).\n\n\\- Friendly players willing to work with new players to create backstories and social networks.\n\n\\- A secondary server only viewable to applied and approved players where you can post playlists, aesthetic images, social media posts, journal entries, as well as having 1-2 private channels specific to your character for housing and training.\n\n\\- Active Staff willing to help new players any way we can and get players immersed in the story faster.\n\n\\- Patience. It's a lot of lore. It's okay if it takes a while to get through it all.\n\n\\- An NPC Library to check out characters for scenes when your own characters are locked down.\n\n\\- Full transparency. We hold honesty and clear communication above everything.\n\n**What we expect:**\n\n\\- literacy\n\n\\- a 3 paragraph minimum per post (there are exceptions to this, but the majority of players should strive for this)\n\n\\- realistic characters that fit the server lore\n\n\\- activity every 2 weeks, or communication with the Admins if you need to take time away\n\n\\- read the FAQ\n\n\\- a drive to grow as a writer\n\n**Classes Available:**\n\n\\- Air\n\n\\- Fire\n\n\\- Water\n\n\\- Darkness\n\n\\- Light\n\n\\- Spirit\n\n\\- Earth\n\n\\- Necromancy\n\n\\- Beast (small wait list)\n\n**Locked Classes:**  \n\\- Hybrid Mages (mages born from opposite classed parents, or from one Mirskoy parent)  \n\\- Variant Mages (mages descended from hybrids whose abilities manifest as a variation of two classes)\\*  \n\\- Mythic Class \\*\n\n\\* *Available as a secondary character with Admin approval, or as a check-out from the NPC library.*\n\n**Royal Families Available:**\n\n\\- Air ( 1 open availability slot left)\n\n\\- Fire\n\n\\- Dark\n\n\\- Spirit\n\n**Upcoming/Ongoing Events:**  \n\\- Hybrid Relations Act Event (abduction &amp; experimentation on hybrid mages)  \n\\- Internment Arc  \n\\- Summer Trips  \n\\- Sigil Exclusion Arc  \n\\- Alumni Formal  \n\\- Tattoo Arc\n\n[Link to Rookshaven on Discord](https://discord.gg/64HWFYy)",

            "selftext": "I am an experienced, literate+ cis female writer looking for a long-term writing partner of any gender to fill the male roles in the narratives we dream up and to help me create worlds and breathe life into characters that we fall irreparably in love with. I want depth and pain and beauty and drama and writing so delicious you could die. I'm not asking for much, just that special magic that can happen rarely when two talented minds meet a blank page and tackle it together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Come wander with me through worlds of our own making.\n\n# \n\nI am going to try and keep this as brief as possible while still offering as much information as I can so you can decide whether or not you think we'd mesh well before shooting me a PM.  &lt;3 **Bolded big stuff so you can skim, though**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 6/19/19-  UPDATED CRAVINGS/IDEA SNIPPETS SECTION\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Also please don't comment here, PM me if you want to communicate about anything written below.**\n\n# \u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\n\n# The big compatibility stuff/my preferences:\n\n**\u2661** I have been doing RP/one on one writing in some capacity or another for **\\~19 years**. It's why I can write to what I humbly believe to be at least a **somewhat decent** level. Being able to write every single day for months on end for more years of my life than not has given me invaluable experience in character creation, development, world building, narrative, all of it.\n\n**\u2661** I mention this because I would very much prefer it if you are also **literate** to **advanced literate** in your writing. I ask that you are fairly experienced with a firm grasp of spelling, grammar, and storytelling. I **don't** ask that you be perfect, I am a **better storyteller** than I am at grammar and punctuation and all that, tbh and as a warning. I'm gonna make glaring mistakes because the words were just rushing out too fast and I was blinded by the vision of the scene and the things I was trying to convey, but I do try my best.\n\nAll that to say again, we're both human, perfection isn't being sought here, but just write good, k?\n\n**\u2661** I use chat-speak in **ooc chatter**. I ramble. I overshare and brainstorm and will flood your messages while you're away\n\n**\u2661** I am **only** interested in **hetero romance** pairings. I know, ew, str8 ppl. But the heart wants what it wants, as we all know.\n\n**\u2661** I prefer **Discord/e-mail/G docs/PM** **of some sort** for the actual writing and **Discord** for ooc chatter and brainstorming.\n\n**\u2661** I **\\*really\\*** am not comfortable working with anyone younger than around **\\~22+** Like, I have **zero** interest and it'll be a flat **no** from me. Sorry.\n\n**\u2661** I do **lean** towards **favoring female writing partners**, trans women, of course included as long as you are willing to play cis males opposite my character. That's the **main requirement.** Not only a **willingness** but a **desire** to play a **male character in a romance story with a cis woman**. I just enjoy how easy it is to get on the same page with another woman. I won't turn you away BECAUSE you're a guy but we're less prone to get on, I have found from experience. My last two long-term writing partners who I cherish dearly were female. If you're a talented writer though who loves romance and drama and world-building, don't hesitate to shoot your shot. &lt;3\n\n**\u2661** I do **only** play female main characters, and I understand if that is frustrating to you, but that is my preference. If you don't enjoy playing the main male roles, **do not PM me**. I'm not about asking you to do anything you don't want to do. If you don't want to...please don't.\n\n**\u2661** I don't know if this is a given, but I also ask that you **help** me populate the **side-characters** as needed for our world and our stories.\n\n**\u2661** **I do not like pre-made characters**. I expect that **all** characters used in our stories are made expressly for those stories.\n\n**\u2661** I write in **third person past-tense POV only**.\n\n**\u2661** I **only** use actors and models for **character references**.\n\n\u2661 I do **not** have many limits for adult themes and I do **not** fade to black but there must be a balance between those themes and storytelling, tipped in the favor of good, amazing storytelling and all the drama and pain of whatever situation plagues our characters. Please include your **NSFW** preferences in your introductory PM. **\u2661**\n\n**\u2661** SO yeah, just to make it a bullet point, I prefer **long-term** writing partners. We can certainly do **one-offs** for cravings, and leave and come back to stories and worlds and plots as we please, we are after all in charge, but I prefer to have one or two steady people I can turn to when I want to work on something either creatively for a few months or to satisfy a craving in the moment that may or may not turn into something long-term we work on or come back to.\n\n\u2661 **Please don't invite me to your group role-plays**. &lt;3 Thanks so much for the thought and I am flattered but I am only interested in one on one stuff for now. The most I would consider is maybe occasionally working together with a third party if you wanted to bring one in on discord someday.\n\n**\u2661** I **don't** tend to like **canon characters**. I will take ideas from characters and build something new around that, something similar, but still mine. I will also do this with settings, worlds, drawing from TV and movies and comics and books, etc. But I will never play a canon character and for me to play opposite one, as in you playing a canon character, would have to be a huge crave or a lot of convincing and pretense and plot that I like.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Take a look at what I am interested in actually writing just below, and if you find your interest piqued further and want to delve into any of these worlds with me and create some characters, get right into it and start brainstorming and seeing if we vibe, please send me a PM. Introduce yourself. If you have writing samples, send them. If you have questions, ask them. Ideas? Tell me them. \u2661\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What I want to actually write/loose plot/setting/character ideas -\n\n# \u2661\n\n**My biggest crave at the moment:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSomething with some pretty **heavy sci-fi/space** themes. A crew waking up on a colony, or scientists and colony members waking on either a ship, a colony, or a new planet. Borrowing some themes from some of the Alien and Bladerunner films would be a lot of fun too if done right and with our own spin. This is a big crave at the moment. I would love to develop something in this genre with a talented partner with similar interest in these types of stories and worlds. Maybe adding in some elements of Handmaid's Tale or something else to make it ours. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn a completely different direction but perhaps the same greater setting, I also have an idea I've been toying around with that borrows some concepts from Stardust and Guardians of the Galaxy, of all places. Involving a star plucked or maybe knocked from where she'd been radiating and singing her songs for millennia in a remote galaxy by a god-like cosmic being. She'd become personified and take on a human-like form, either by choice, force, or accident and then we could develop a love story that could ensue thereafter, entangled in some danger, adventure, drama, etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have a few more ideas in these realms, too and have been in a pretty big sci-fi mood lately. **\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u2661\u2661\u2661\n\nMy next biggest crave would be something set in a remote location. I see a cabin surrounded by a seemingly endless landscape of snow and ice. Think North of the wall in GOT but in modern times, a few years into the future, likely after a shift because of climate change so maybe even someplace that was never historically even nearly this cold, thus why our characters would be stranded there and have to learn some of the skills they learn to survive without knowing them by heart or with mastery. Maybe they meet not too long after the freeze which would have been sudden and apocalyptic a la that movie Day After Tomorow, and they're both barely hanging on. Maybe my character is a bit more established and takes yours in. We can iron out the meeting but I know I want a fairly gritty story with drama and danger and love and survival and some slice of life elements mixed in too, as being perpetually buried in snow leaves much time to pass and skip around and play in while they're just inside their refuge.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would like to see my character paired with a guy who is at least a few years older than her. Maybe he does have some survival skills/knowledge but he is injured either by her while she is hunting or when he arrives and is thus incapacitated, so she takes him in and heals him. He could trade that knowledge for shelter and safety and medicine and besides, if she shoots him it would give her a greater feeling of obligation to help him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's just a few loose ideas at this point and I would love to brainstorm with you to iron out the details if this world and fragments I'm describing sound appealing. Picturing lots of snow, ice. Lots of danger in the cold. A romance that comes maybe unexpectedly but certainly inevitably after a medium to slow burn. Then maybe a family, a story of generations surviving. I like to take stories we tell on their own and once they've sort of run their course then open them up, expand on them. I like to add generations, tie things in with small details and in as many ways as I can organically work in. Even if we're someday telling a fantasy/sci-fi story, I may find a way to tie it back to this story.\n\n# Other fragments of ideas:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\u2661\u2661** **Westworld** \\- Two guests meet in the park (doesn't have to be exactly like the one in the show) and fall in love. Adventure and danger and lots of fun and drama could be outlined for this easily. Open to some light sci-fi elements for this one. very subtle things, nothing too overt.\n\n**\u2661\u2661\u2661 RDR/The Revenant/Western US in the 1800s** \\- Pretty straight forward, just delving into a romance set in the wild west. Instead of being in a park and from a modern or futuristic present, we'd be dabbling in some historical fiction.\n\n**\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661** **Cold Mountain/US Civil War era** \\-   More specifically the civil war era in the southeastern US, all the way across the country from the above mentioned western US setting and a bit earlier. The 1860s. Different than the Western idea in that this would likely be set in the Appalachian Mountains. I imagine a lot of hardship, survival, hunting, war, love, etc. Not actually based on the book or the movie. Just the source of inspiration for a world for us to play in.\n\n**\u2661\u2661\u2661** Something set in a **small southern town -** Just maybe minus all the racism and misogyny? At least as far as our characters go. I grew up in a town like this, and leaving it has left me nostalgic for some of that undeniable southern charm.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese would of course need to be developed a lot more, but I truly love that kind of collaborative development of plot and characters, so that's fine by me. I prefer to leave things as more of a loose skeleton without fleshing everything as far as plot and narrative out tooooo much, because I like for the characters to kind of help to illuminate the way as we go. **Brainstorming and sharing ideas is great, plotting things to death and down to the very last detail isn't much fun for me though.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u2661 No matter what kind of world and characters we work in and with, I want a heavy, unforgivably human type of story that will ultimately reward us with a beautiful narrative and characters that feel real and alive. Hopefully a friendship and/or writing partnership. Maybe the start of a whole new world we can dabble and play in at our leisure. That's always my hope.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want beauty and heartache and pain and drama and love and yeah, I want a little magic but not in the fantasy sense of the word. I want the magic of two creative, talented minds working together for a common goal and breathing life with words. I want a nice slow to medium-burn of a love story to start out hopefully many lovely stories we can tell together. There are universes to be made.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have characters already kind of fleshed out a bit in my mind and some ideas for side characters and plot and backstory and such for the craves listed here, depending on what your character is like and what we decide of course on for the tone and plot. I want some elements of slice of life, but forward-driving plot at a decent pace. I write with as much depth, detail, and color as I possibly can but sometimes it will be more casual, sometimes it will be really lengthy, just depending on mood.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**If any of this sounds good to you, please don't hesitate to PM me and we can go from there. Most of the above can be worked out.**\n\n# \u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\n\n# Bonus rambling:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u2661 Usually having the male main character at least a couple of years older than the character I am playing will end up being my vibe. I like to make female characters that challenge and assert against men who might consciously or unconsciously use age as an excuse to dismiss or otherwise silence or stifle them at the beginning, or if they're not the type sometimes also perhaps to use that juxtaposition of age and character for fun because of some of these societally pre-conceived notions, etc.\n\n\u2661 Taking breaks for burnout is totally fine, I will probably take a couple over the course of say, a year, and that's why I prefer having long-term partners. Ditching though, I don't appreciate and try not to do myself. Just let me know, I get it. We're human beings with lives and mental and physical health needs. Or maybe we just aren't meshing? Don't sweat it, just tell me. I will certainly try and do the same.\n\n\u2661 I can get **very** into world, mood and character building and have in the past collaborated on playlists, character references, setting reference, mood boards, etc. with writing partners to help expand on the world based on the mood, using these things as a way to further get on the same page so we can write in both the same tone and from the closest that I think two minds can probably get when working on one world together from two totally different upbringings, sometimes writing styles, background, history, experience, mood, locations in the world, etc. There are a lot of variables, but I feel like discussing characters and setting and vibes and themes you want to include and songs that make you think of a character or a moment or a feeling related to the story and all of that can level some of those variables and bring two people to the same place creatively. It's magic when it happens, and if you've experienced it you know it, and I guess that's what I am looking for again. A little magic, no big deal. Right?\n\n\u2661 I like to tell stories that can sometimes span generations. Maybe even time and space. But most important, stories about families and characters that feel real and who come to life for us. I like having things that I write with long-term writing partners eventually be woven together in some way or another, so that it's a cohesive world, even if in one story we're dabbling in Science Fiction and then in another maybe historical fiction or slice of life or anything in-between. I love doing stuff like that and being collaborative about world building and borrowing characters and adding generations and ancestors and relatives to families as we go and as the opportunity arises no matter the genre or era we are writing in. I've yet to meet a plot line I can't at least loosely tie together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# PM ME NOW IF YOU'VE MADE IT THIS FAR! \u2661",

            "selftext": "Hello there. I make this post every once in a while, sometimes they just don't pan out or they get abandoned by the opposite party. I'm looking for anyone, male or female, age 18+ to Roleplay with somebody on kik or discord. I'm really easy to get along with, and most of the time I use created characters for just about any scenario, but there are some instances I use Canon Characters. I'm up for all sorts of settings, scenarios, timeframes, etc. It could be modern day, fantasy, semi-fantasy, medieval, futuristic, magical, post-apocalyptic, you name it, I can try to make it work. That being said, I'm a huge fan of action packed RP's as well. I know my way around firearms as well so if you have knowledge of firearms too, I think we'll make a great team.\n\nWhy 18+ you ask? Well there are lots of times where it can get a little steamy, and I'm not trying to get jammed up. Please respect that. All of the 18+ aspects of the RP can be discussed when you message me.\n\nWhen it comes to fandoms/universes that I wouldn't mind RPing (both original and canon characters) in: Metal Gear is at the top of my list. I'm also a big fan of Resident Evil (or anything zombie related), Uncharted, and quite a few others. Just ask!\n\nI can get rather detailed in my posts. I'm not a huge fan of things like \"\\*aims and shoots zombie in head\\*\" or \"\\*reloads\\*\". We're essentially writing a story together, it should sound like one. I can write in both first and third person, past or present tense. Whatever works best for you will work for me.\n\nIf you made it this far, hopefully you're interested! Shoot me a DM and we can work out the details.\n\nI work for a living and I do have an outside life, so please don't get hot and bothered if it takes me a while to respond sometimes.\n\nLook forward to hearing from you all!",

Before you may consider sending me a PM let me tell you a little about myself and background and what I am looking for exactly.\n\nFirst off I'd like to say that not only am I looking for a writing partner, but I'm looking for a new friend too. Writing is my life and I can't just invest myself completely in a storyline with someone who isn't friends with me. I'm fairly in touch with my emotions when I write, my characters are apart of me, so writing to someone who doesn't mesh well with me is going to be near impossible.\n\nI've been a roleplayer for years (roughly 6). I consider myself to be advanced literate but I prefer semi-literate posts, mostly so I can post more often. I'm pretty open to any genre, and I don't have a problem with adding sex to storylines (I'm bisexual). My characters almost always stay in the 18-30 age range, and I make a brand new character for each story. My favorite genres would have to be romance/fantasy/syfy/and crime. \n\nIdeally, my new partner would need to be around my age (18-30), open to a lot of things, fairly active, semi/advanced literate, and are willing to communicate. I don't appreciate getting ghosted for no reason, I'm pretty understand when it comes to stuff, I just like a heads up. I'm open to roleplaying on all formats, though I prefer kik/discord over anything else. \n\nIf you have any questions feel free to ask! I pretty laid back and I usually respond fairly quick. I just can't wait to start a storyline with someone new \u263a",

I reply daily. Some days I may have time for more than one reply, while other days leave me without the time to prepare a proper meal, so some degree of understanding is necessary. I'm an adult with an active life. It would be atypical for me to go more than a day or two without giving a heads up as to when my next reply should be expected. \n\nDiscord only. \n\n*Roleplay Information:*\n\n\nMy fandoms are as follows: \n\nMarvel (MCU, I haven't read the comics since grade school) - I play Tony, Bruce, Steve, Bucky, Loki, and Thor. Preferred ships are Tony x Bruce, Tony x Steve, and Tony x Loki.  \n\n\nHarry Potter - Honestly only for Remus x Sirius.  \n\nSherlock - I can play Sherlock, John, or Moriarty.  \n\nA few other smaller TV show universes such as Sense8, Grey's Anatomy, and Criminal Minds. I'm happy to mix characters from different universes. \n\nWhile I don't have much experience with the use of OCs outside of fiction writing, you're free to use one. I only ask that your characters (OC or canon) are realistic in the sense that they aren't total headcases who require endless attention and coddling. \n\nI'm open to romance and smut, but I do request that we aren't running a short plot for the sake of throwing two characters into bed together. I prefer story and character development. \n\nPlotting can happen when we chat and get a feel for our mutual interests. I am always happy to make the first post. Post length should be variable depending on the needs of the plot, but I'd prefer consistent paragraph length replies with the potential to be longer. A basic understanding of English grammar is ideal.",

I'm pretty good about posting every day, but sometimes things come up. I'm very flexible with the amount/length of posts.\n\n**Specifications:**\n\n\\- *Please be literate.* I tend to write long novel style posts with a lot of descriptions. 1 paragraph minimum, but don't force to write a ton for the sake of words. I'm okay with rapid fire/casual rps! Just still at least 1 paragraph. 3rd person only! \n\n\\- *Frequency.* I work all day for about 10+ hours online. I'm not always looking on Discord as this is just a hobby for me. If something comes up, I will let you know - I just expect the same!\n\n\\- *Discord.* I only use Discord to rp, I will not use anything else as I do not check it as often\n\n\\- *18+ only.* This includes any OCs! Nothing personal, and I know you can lie about it\n\n**Genres I am willing to RP:**\n\n\\- *Star Wars:* Any era/situation is welcome! My OC is a Grey Jedi/Master whose background can be changed to fit the plot\n\n\\- *Law Enforcement:* Can be criminal x criminal or criminal x officer. My OC is already in the crime underground\n\n\\- *Apocalypse:* Any world ending cause is welcome! \n\n\\- *Medieval Monarchy:* Courting process, royalty x commoner, ect. Can be light fantasy\n\n\\- *Others:* Have another idea? Let me know! I'm really flexible with plots! I'm not exactly into fantasy\n\nI'd like all of these to include romance! This would be developed and woven in, not forced.\n\n\nThanks for your time! &lt;3",

I don't mind, gender, sexual orientation, or which gender you prefer to play. I'm open to playing girls, or guys, or monster, or sentient pets. Pretty much anything tbh. \n\nI am somewhat literate I think? The meaning of the world always kinda escapes me. I post at least 2 hood paragraphs most of the time, more when inspired. Sometimes I have writers block and it can be shaved down to 1 but I promise to give enough content and quality to make up for it. \n\nI'm big into fantasy, high fantasy, dark fantasy, Japanese fantasy, all things magical and mystical. I'm also big into romance, but the real slow burn type, if anything its like a backing plot a lot of the time. \n\nI play over discord. It's real easy to keep organized and I love having ideas going back and forth when roleplaying. I also like making info dumps for things we may need later and characters in the story.\n\nIf I use reference pics they will likely be drawn, cartoony pics. RL pics kinda take me out of it sometimes, but descriptions work as well. \n\nOther things I'm into: Wild West, Futuristic, Heros and Villains, Monster vs Humans, apocalyptic (not really into zombies tho), Steakpunk, anything with action and adventures. I would love to hear any ideas you have as well.\n\nSo with all that being said you can PM me so we can talk more and maybe get something rolling. Hope to hear from y'all!",

To make this post short and sweet, I'll just make a list of things which should make it easier for people to see what I like.\n\nGenres I like: Medieval, Post Apoc, Dark, Gritty, Horror, Low Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Pirates, Western, Superheroes, Grim-Dark (pretty much every NSFW tag), Greek, Roman, some Fandoms (Fallout, Elder Scrolls, FNAF, Warframe, Game Of Thrones, Star Wars, and Alien Vs Predator are some which quickly come to mind, admittedly, there is a lot which I like, but these are the main few).\n\nWhat I hope (though am not limited to) to do RP wise however, is play a character in someone's world, basically exploring about and doing stories whenever the character stumbles upon them or happens to fall into one. A GM/DM is who I am primarily looking for as a partner (BUT not required!). And hopefully one who has no limits, like me. And yes, I'm fine with playing female characters too.\n\nIn terms of RP, I have no limits, so any story can go with me or anything can happen in RP and i'm fine with it.\n\nSo if you're interested in a partner with no limits, i'm up for it!\n\nIf you want to ask anything, make sure of anything or anything of the like, feel free to message me or talk with me using the Reddit chat system.\n\nThough please, don't just remove me while we're setting things up or whatever else. If you have the urge, please tell me why so we can work on it or so that I'd at least be aware. :)\n\nThanks for reading!",

            "selftext": "Hey!   So a few things before I dive in: 1) I am coming over from the NSFW RP subreddits, but don\u2019t hold it against me.  I\u2019m not just a perv and the vast majority of my role playing is story focused.  There can be an NSFW element to the role play or not.  It truly depends on us and the story!  2) this prompt is borrowed from a similar one by a role player over there.  If desired/necessary I can give them credit, that\u2019s no issue.  I just don\u2019t want anyone thinking I am stealing people\u2019s ideas with reckless abandon.  3) I am a very flexible and experienced role player and I am happy to adapt my style and response-length to my partner.  Don\u2019t feel bad if you have a hard time with crazy long responses.  You deserve fun stories too.  I also have an odd schedule which we can discuss later.  \n\nNow then!  The actual prompt, idea, concept, whatever you want to call it...  I am the world\u2019s greatest mage.  The arch magister.  Lord high artificer.  Sorcerer on high.  Sacred enchanter.  Runelord.  Whatever.  You have been taken in as an apprentice (for reasons we can discuss or leave mysterious, up to us), though you might see it more like an unpaid internship considering the lame errands I often send you on.  The worst part is that nothing you do seems to go right.  You have a naturally high stockpile of magical energy, but you seem to be cursed. Simple spells blow up in your face, potions melt holes in my tables, gizmos run wild and fling their rune-etched gears left and right.   You are, in terms of magic, a failure.   Still, there\u2019s no reason in the world to give up this opportunity for study.  Plus, it\u2019s not so bad living with me and seeing real, high quality magic at work.  After all, seemingly impossible spellcrafting comes as naturally as breathing to me.  \n\nI teach you, train you, and rely on you for chores and errands every day, building up your immense mastery of failure, boredom, curiosity,  and, very rarely, your chances of minor successes.  This will be a story of many small, quirky happenings that result from your odd magical mishaps or my strange experiments, as well as some potentially deep connection and growth.  After all, you make a great guinea pig.  Who knows?   Maybe you accidentally bind yourself to the back of a door with enchanted spider silk, turn yourself into a squirrel on accident, or replace your voice with that of a grandfather clock.  No matter what the adventures are, you can be sure I\u2019d get a kick out of it.   \n\nI wouldn\u2019t be playing a cruel or deranged character though and I wouldn\u2019t be needlessly torturing you.   For whatever reason (we can potentially discuss all of this before starting) my intentions do oftentimes seem mostly passable, if not good.   \n\nSo!  As you can probably tell, this idea is high in details and low in foundation in my head.  That\u2019s where you come in.  Before we start I would love to hear any ideas you have!   That goes for setting and everything.  We could be in a high fantasy world, a modern world with a hidden magical underworld, or even a sci-fi futurist world where we are the last bastion of true high magic.  What would you like your character to be like?   Do you have ideas for mine?   Essentially as long a you don\u2019t completely gut the central concept, I want to hear every single idea you\u2019ve got.  That includes images!   Do you have an idea of what you want to look like?   What about a living space?   What about me?   I want to know what you\u2019ve got in mind and make this a collaborative effort.  \n\nLet\u2019s plan this out together!  That means I\u2019m not down for starting from the first message.  Do not start the first message off by role playing or I will not respond.  Let\u2019s chat for a while, get to know where we\u2019re both at in terms of our ideas.  \n\nYou can play any (humanoid) race you want, as well as any gender though I have to be honest and say that women and woman-like partners are preferred.  Hit me with some details!   But also, just so I know you read this whole stupid post, let me know what your favorite flavor of ice cream is in your first message?",

Many channels are much more orderly than ever before, and though we are still learning and growing we are content with where we currently stand. In response to our criticisms, both good and bad, we are making changes to better suit the tastes of our players while maintaining the Ayrussian image that has always stood strong and proud. Many limitations have been reconstructed into much looser rules, set up in ways that reward active members while not punishing members who perhaps have a little too much on their plate to be around Ayrus for dinner. We are more than happy to say that the ever-improving server of Ayrus is now welcome to an even wider variety of new and old members, and we thank you for the time you've spent considering a stay at Ayrus.  \n\n\n\\-As of June 2019, we are now offering certain server partnerships!   \n\n\nIf you're interested in checking us out, you can do so here: [https://discord.gg/a7vsdgN](https://discord.gg/a7vsdgN)",

I\u2019d prefer to have a partner who writes at least a paragraph. Also, I only play female characters as it\u2019s just what I\u2019m comfortable with. Please PM me if you\u2019re interested!

In short, imagination can take the unpleasant aspects of this weird and twisted world in which we live, and make them into things we're glad to wake up to in the morning.\n\nFriendship is another wonderful and powerful thing. \n\nIt can bind people together for life, let them endure the most catastrophic hardships, and life people up to new heights they never thought possible. A friend at your side is a great blessing, a good friend can save your life, and your best friend can change your life altogether. \n\nIt is those things I'd like to explore and utilize in this story, which takes heavy inspiration from Bridge to Terabithia, a wonderful book and film of you haven't seen or read it. I'd like us to play a pair or a group of young friends that go through life together, sharing the good times and enduring the hardships as only true friends can. Whenever they want to celebrate some great stroke of fortune, escape from some great hardship, or simply pass the bountiful free time their juvenile lives afford them, they go to their special and secret place. Whether it be a hand built treehouse, a well kept spot by the river, an unused allyway, these friends have come together to make it their own and let it be whatever they wanr or need it to be. Whether that might be a space ship under attack by zombie ninjas, a stash of favorite games and books to wile away the time, or simply a quiet and secure place to hide away from all life's problems and hardship, the hideaway is there for them as they are there for each other. \n\nIf what I've written here appeals to you at all, then I'd love to hear from you! My DMs are always open, and I'll respond to you as soon as I can, which may be a little later because I'm about to go to bed at time of writing, but I pinky promise I'll return your message when I see it.\n\nHope to see you soon! :)",

            "selftext": "Hey there. I'm looking for someone to create an amazing, gripping story with. The main theme I like to play is romance but we can also add different elements into it if you wish. Please note though, fantasy is a big no! I would really appreciate it if you were reliable, and tell me if it got boring because then it's fair. If you ghost me, don\u2019t expect a sudden second chance. Of course we will both have our own personal lives but I\u2019ll always communicate healthily and let you know when I\u2019m busy. If you're going to message, be serious about this too and have a clear idea about what you want. I can do first or third person, I can change my preference if needs to be. Honestly, I will NOT accept one liners nor will I respond back to you if you're just gonna ghost. I've had enough of people just coming along for short-term purposes when this is LONG term. I cannot stress that enough.\n\nMy list:\n\n\\~Friends from childhood.\n\n\\~Roommates.\n\n\\~Nurse and Solider/veteran.\n\n\\~Prince/Princess falls for a village girl/boy.\n\n\\~Friends with benefits\n\n\\~Rich Entrepreneur and interior designer.\n\n\\~Gang member and innocent girl.\n\n\\~Strangers\n\nAnd of course, any other ideas you wish to tell me about. Yes I know these are mildly clich\u00e8, so I\u2019m willing to spice them up and add a lot more angst, or even some dark themes if it does fit with the idea. \n\nSmut will have a very small element in this, but it won't be too overpowering as I want to enjoy the story at its fullest - so it will be discussed fully once the plot has been established and there will always be a good build-up before any NSFW. When it happens though, I'll make sure to attend to your every need.I cannot stress this enough; Please be literate (more than a paragraph at least). If you deliver on that, I will too. Roleplay is a two way mutual thing and it has to flow in order to keep a story going. \n\nThanks for reading! I use discord, or kik. Mainly kik though. If you have any other platform, I\u2019ll be sure to download it if I can!",

            "selftext": "I own a roleplay server called Island of Pirren. It\u2019s perfect for beginners, novices, and experienced roleplayers. Our community is small, but close knit. Things have been a bit slow lately, so I figured we could open up to some new players! \n\nThere\u2019s lots of information on the culture already on the server in the #culture chat, and I also have a fully illustrated map for members to use.\n\nHere\u2019s a basic description of the roleplay:\nPirren is a small, fantasy island. There are both humans and dinosaurs who can communicate in a common language. The main plot is to be started soon, but it is a sort of zombie/pandemic survival plot. We generally do our plots on the go, and they\u2019re not super planned out. \n\nSmall bit of info, but we\u2019ll also probably be including ice-age creatures soon, such as dire wolves and saber toothed cats. \n\nPlease leave a comment if you\u2019d like an invite! We won\u2019t be gatekeeping this community, but we\u2019d like to send invites via DM so we know who\u2019s joining.",

I don't have a specific plot in mind at the moment, but would love to come up with one. I would like for us both to share ideas and create a world fiction or non-fiction where our characters meet and have conflict and build a relationship. I am looking for a bit of realism; I dont want our characters to meet and the next thing you know they are all over each other. I like a lot of context so I perfer my roleplays to be rich in story while having a good romantic twist to it. I don't want our relationship to build easily and go perfect. Like I said previously, I want realism. I would prefer if the relationship between our characters took time to build up and have a lot of conflict and drama during the process. This is a longterm roleplay afterall.\n\nIf what I said interests you please DM me so we can further discuss potential plots and character ideas! I am willing to roleplay either on Kik or Discord.",

I am looking for someone who won't ghost or disappear without telling anything because I had that too many times. I expect at least a paragraph as a reply and not just a sentence.\n\n\nAs for the plot, I have few ideas in my mind but I do have my character (Also a ref). I'll let you create your own character and we will see where we can take the rp after we discuss and share our characters. I want you to create your own character because It makes is more interesting and unexpected than if I choose your role. I am both okay with you playing both Female and Male character. Also, you should be willing to rp as NPC's as well (so will I)\n\nThe Rp\u2019s I want to try:\n\u2022 Poor(me)/Rich\n\u2022 Vacation (Hotel)\n\u2022 College/High School Band Rp\n\n\nThanks for reading and I hope you are interested in roleplaying together, please write your fav colour at the title of your message so I'll know you read it all the way through the text and not just spamming.\n\nBye~",

Set in the late 1980s in a fictional city called Raven Cove, Oregon, our characters must solve mysteries, challenge monsters, and worst of all, form interpersonal relationships.\u00a0\n\n\\-\n\nWelcome to Raven Cove, a small town in rural Oregon. It\u2019s 1987, and as the decade begins to wind to a close, things are only winding up for this city where not everything is as it appears. Although it appears normal enough at first glance, Raven Cove is home to a variety of mysterious forces that like to toy with the residents. This little town seems to act as a magnet for all sorts of supernatural phenomena, drawing in everything from angels to aliens. As creatures like vampires and werewolves fight for territory, and shady experiments cause strange weather and other unexplained phenomena, will Raven Cove be able to hold itself together long enough to reach the 90s?\n\n\\-\n\n[More Info](https://ravencoverp.tumblr.com/) ||[About](https://ravencoverp.tumblr.com/about) ||[Appl](https://ravencoverp.tumblr.com/app)y",

We both are up to roleplay pretty much anything\u2014fandoms, original content, even mixtures of both. We are both very relaxed, chill people but we are looking for someone who is in it for the long-haul! \n\nRequirements: \n1. Must be 18+ ; this is a hard rule, and non-negotiable! \n\n2. Must be active ; post at least two, three times a day and probably more. \n\n3. Must be willing to chat!!!! ; My friend and I are chatty people, and it won\u2019t really work out if we aren\u2019t given as good as we give out. \n\n**Our preferred platform is Skype, but we can speak further and work something out.**\n\nOther than that, everything else can be debated and discussed further. Shoot me a pm or reply below, either is fine. Have a lovely day, and I look forward to meeting our next partner!",

This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean long-winded posts, but just higher quality content (character development, showing vs. telling, etc.) This would mean no channels dedicated to their character's outfit and Instagram and would encourage a higher caliber of writing and collaboration. Ideally looking for another writer who is 25+ because you know, life experience.\n\nI play a 30 year indie vocalist with a fair amount of fame, he\u2019s a womanizer, he\u2019s wry, and the themes are dark. I don't really have many limits, and neither should you.\n\nThis character is well over 10 years old. I know him well and the writing will reflect it. He is not for the easily offended or faint-hearted. There will be dark themes, drama, and I do not believe in discussing every plot twist and turn before a story. I\u2019ll surprise you and you surprise me\u2014let\u2019s both send these characters unraveling in ways that we weren\u2019t expecting.\n\nI want to play opposite a complex character with history, ambitions and flaws. This character will eat alive any bland female character. She\u2019ll have to go toe-to-toe with him.\n\nStoryline: I certainly have one in mind that may have a fantasy element, but definitely a captivity element. It's going to be weird and NOT your typical romance, so bear that in mind before DMing me.\n\nPlease DM for more information including Discord handle, website, etc.",

I am a thirtysomething guy on the West Coast of the U.S. who enjoys writing with other people.\n\nI have over a decade of experiences which have led me through adventures all over my imagination; from Renaissance Poets, to Pirate ships, to ports along the Hitchhiker's Guide, and through the Forests of Arcadia, all on multiple formats. I tend to stick to email, discord, or slackchat at present.\n\nMy *comfort zone* for storylines is a niche of Modern roleplay; Fantasy, Science Fiction, Pulp, Romance, and a little dark Neon/Noir. I tend to steer away from Canon, Fandom, or Fanfic.\n\nI work a full-time (stressful) job, and I travel abroad often. So, while I prefer to chat/pm/live play when I'm home, I'll need to change to mail/inbox if I end up without access while I'm away. Generally speaking, I only keep 1-3 partners (and/or 1 Group) at a time, so I can give them my full attention.\n\nI check my inbox at least once a day, usually after 6:00 pm PST.\n\nI write with partners strictly in the third person.\n\nMy characters are flawed, scarred, and human; *even when they are more than human*.\n\nSome of their stories are parables. Some are cautionary tales. Some are just for fun. All of them are deeply layered.\n\nFaceclaims help my process, as do soundtracks and aesthetic boards.\n\n**In character**, we shouldn't want (or need) to get along all of the time. Creating a blend of \"tensions\" is much more rewarding, in my opinion. Please know that behind the screen I am a nice guy. And, while my characters might not always win Man of the Year awards; personally, I could probably (at least) send in an application. I like OOC chit-chat. Getting along makes it easier to collaborate. It also eases the nervous tensions that can arise with perfect strangers making a creative writing exercise together.\n\nThe good stuff:\n\nI consider myself less *vanilla* and more of a *coffee* in my preferences: stimulating, bold, dark, and bittersweet. I need the trifecta Vente\\` of chemistry, inspiration, and plot.\n\nPeeves:\n\nToo many rules make me sad, but, here goes:\n\nI use an editing application that will correct spelling and most grammar mistakes. All I ask is that you, please do me the same courtesy. If all I get in response is your cellphone's thumbed-up, typo-laden response -- it might actually offend me that you'd waste my time.\n\nIf it boils down to what we are working on is not working: I promise to let you know so that we can part on good terms. No ghosting.\n\nFeel free to message me if you'd like to work something up together.\n\nI am sincerely looking forward to hearing from you.",

This sparking protectiveness or even more rivalry. Please only roleplay in 1st person only.\n\nI would play a female OC and would love you to do the same. Guys can join in but please stick to being female. I would like to stick to the timeline of Naruto to Boruto, but where we fit in can be anytime! Also, I want an OC from you so we can have the canon characters interact with us. I don't mind people playing NEW characters from the families and changing them, but I want original characters. \n\nThis is a romance orientated thing that I hope builds up longterm over weeks and months. Drama, heartache and love all are things I love in a relationship.\n\nPlease PM me so we can get talking!",

I've been roleplaying for a couple of years now and only recently stumbled across this reddit so decided to make a post myself, finally!\n\nI am looking for 18+ guy, that's interested in a romantic/ slice of life/adventure roleplay plot over Discord, preferably long term.\n\nI am open to most ideas and plot suggestions - though I am not that into fantasy or supernatural unfortunately and prefer 'modern' romantic/slice of life ideas. I have a few plot prompts written up, but am more open to creating a plot together that we'd both enjoy! Not looking for one liners or anything purely NSFW. Please be imaginative and suggest your own ideas - it's rather boring and becomes rather tedious when it is only one sided! I am interested in anything romantic, so feel free to suggest any plots that you think would be relevant and that you would like to explore!\n\nIf you are interested in finding out more or have any questions, feel free to PM me!\n\nLove,\n\nJas x",

I enjoy writing darker themes. I enjoy writing NSFW themes, lengthy emotes and most importantly, a plot. I like to know our roleplay is going somewhere. \n\nThat being said, my only requirements are that you are 21 or older [preferably older, as am I], you are semi-literate to advanced literate to match my skill level, and you enjoy detailed writing as much as I do. I want to be completely immersed in a story. \n\nI do not enjoy writing fandoms or canons. I want my own character to exist in their own world. I write in 3rd person, and tend to stick to one single character that I can develop.",

            "selftext": "__Hi everyone and thanks for taking the time to check out my post.__\n\n\nAs I have found it quite useful in constructing these in the past, I will be outlining the two main characters I have in mind for this idea first, then explain the setting and finally give you an idea what I am looking for.\n\n\nFair warning I wrote the plot for Taylor Swift as the female character, but before you click away and dismiss this as just another thirsty plot trying to live out some fantasy, I'd ask that you please read the rest first. My reason for using her is that she for one is at the level of fame and fortune I envision for the character's career and (though embarrassing to admit) because I actually quite like her music and thus know about it.\n\n\n### Without a voice is a singer still a singer?\n\n\nHer career had been at its all time high. Her fans ranged from teenagers discovering her music now to the precious late 20s early 30s demographic, people her own age.\n\n\nEach album an instant chart topper, each single a hit on radio stations worldwide, each tour sold out within minutes of tickets going live. She had it all, money, fame, everything the young girl dreaming of a life in the big cities had dreamed of.\n\n\nAnd then, one morning she woke up with a cold. as usual her voice was all but gone, her throat sore, her nose runny. Nothing to worry about. Certainly not an affliction that a few days rest couldn't cure. And sure enough the cold went, her throat no longer scratchy, her nose clear. Yet her voice never returned.\n\n\nShe could speak just fine, sure. But anything any attempt to conjure a tune and an unbearably sharp pain would stab at her vocal chords. Understandably panic ensued. Innumerable doctors, of increasing specialisation and renown, later, she was left with the most infuriating of diagnoses. _\"Idiopathic\"_ The medical profession's fancy term for, \"we don't know what it is, what caused it or how to fix it\"\n\n\nPanic turned to depression. The machinery of show business kicked into gear and within a month, her label, who had been wooing her with contracts, trying to lock down her next album deal, had liquidated her. Her tours were cancelled, talk show invitations rescinded and soon enough she was well and truly out.\n\n\nNot that most would have considered her fate truly tragic of course. She had been the single most profitable artist prior to her fall. Her wealth was considerable, even in the hedonistic hills of Hollywood.\n\n\nYet, with it all gone, she no longer felt at home amongst those who still had _it_, whatever _it_ was. Her music had been her life, even with all the money and fame, she had always loved it best. No longer able to sing her songs, she couldn't have bared to pen them for someone else.\n\n\nThe decision to leave, to turn her back on her idyllic California estate and the penthouse in New York, took her little time. She had her chief of staff, in what would likely be her final act - for she couldn't see what she's need a staff for now - inquire about suitable accommodation in the one place she'd always imagined she might one day live. England, more specifically, the luscious southern countryside of the home counties.\n\n\nShe wasn't sure what exactly drew her to that small island across the ocean. She'd visited during her tours of course, but only the larger cities, London, Manchester, Birmingham and the like. Maybe it was the idyllic pictures she had seen or the TV series romanticising that part of the country, but something had always drawn her to the rolling hills of southern England.\n\n\nSoon enough a number of promising advertisements made their way to her, including a peculiar listing for a country villa, formally part of, but offered for rent separately from a much larger estate.\n\n\n### _Noblesse oblige_, whether one like it or not\n\n\nFor most of his life, the heir to Edgerton estate had despised his father, its lord. Had anyone dared to ask why, he likely couldn't have named a single, determining moment that inspired the arctic climate between them. It wasn't so much the man himself he hated, but what he stood for, what he represented: An ancient breed of aristocrats, who, defying the changing times, still clung onto power and wealth in modern England.\n\n\nThe Edgerton estate was about as old and esteemed as one might find. The family inheriting its name had been its keepers for centuries. Through wars, civil and foreign, throughout the reigns of many a king and queen, the lords of Edgerton manor had help positions of great importance and power.\n\n\nThe fortune, amassed over the estate's long history - much of it through means looked less than fondly on today - the family enterprise, now no longer in shipping and manufacturing, but the financial markets, even the hereditary peerage granting Lord Edgerton a seat in the house of lords, all remained to this day.\n\n\nThe son of the man currently reigning over this empire could not have loathed more what he was to inherit one day. In his mind his family represented everything he felt was holding back his country from becoming what his generation wished it could be.\n\n\nDeep down he knew that beyond this, his disdain for his father was rooted in the man's indifference to his mother, the one creature on this earth he had felt closest to. Until illness took her from him and had him sent away, across the country to boarding school. When he emerged, years later, as a young man, from the wood panelled halls of Eton, he wished nothing more than to leave it all behind.\n\n\nDenouncing his father's wishes he pursued a degree in the sciences, something the Lord of Edgerton Manor had little use of, or so he was told. Four years at university did much to lighten his spirit. He had almost forgotten the weight on his shoulders, knowing that one day he would be called upon to take his father's place.\n\n\nHis passion for science, another great treasure university had bestowed upon him, lead him to a career in research. He was three years into his doctoral studies when his old life returned to haunt his soul.\n\n\nHis father, by no means of old age and of sound health, had passed away to the great dismay of both his household and the English nobility at large. Having always hoped he'd have time to prepare, maybe even find an escape, the son now found himself burdened overnight with his father's privileges and duties.\n\n\nAfter resisting for a month or so, he soon realised that he stood no chance, one man against centuries of tradition and the fate of many a person in the balance. For while the business was largely conducted with only marginal oversight of the lord, the estate of Edgerton Manor still had in its employ more than a hundred residents of the villages surrounding its expansive lands.\n\n\nWith a heavy heart the new Lord Edgerton had to abandon his studies and return \"home\". Settling into the Manor and getting a grasp of what would likely constitute the daily routine of his remaining years left him irritable and depressed.\n\n\nOne of the many unwelcome tasks he found himself settled with was to decide how to handle his mother's estate. The large, country house, situated on the edge of Edgerton Park, the local name for the gardens, lakes and woodland surrounding the main manor, had passed to him when he lost her. His only fond childhood memories were all set in its gardens, lovingly kept by his mother, who was also the heroine of each story.\n\n\nAfter deliberating for a week, he decided that he could not justify keeping the housekeeper and gardener charged with its upkeep employed if the house was to remain unoccupied. Thus he begrudgingly allowed the property to be listed for rent, under the strict stipulation that any prospective tenant would be carefully vetted by him personally.\n\n\nIn case someone has wondered, I have (loosely) based the female character on Taylor Swift (wait don't run for the hills just yet!) and the male on my own experiences going to a painfully posh boarding school and interacting with people (usually parents) from that world. Have you clicked away yet? No? Good! First of all don't worry, I only went to school with those people, I'm not exactly one of them (too poor). As for the obnoxious reference to a celebrity, please don't think that I'm simply looking to live out some sad fantasy featuring exactly her and no one else. I include Ms. Swift (albeit begrudgingly) only so that you might get a better idea of the kind of age, fame, etc. I have in mind for the character. Feel free to make her your own in every way! \u00a0\n\n\n### The setting (other than \"in England\")\n\n\nAs the tag indicates, I see this as a slow-burning, realistic romance. Both characters have had a rather bleak time getting to where we would be picking up the story, so there is plenty of development to be had.\n\n\nI'm also always looking to expand a story beyond the confines of just a single genre. I for example see these two characters helping each other cope with their respective situations. Their new environment and eventual relationship leaves things open for all sorts of storylines to be explored.\n\n\nI can see there being elements of mystery, intrigue, adventure and much more as the story develops. And it's worth noting that I consider \"long-term\" to truly mean __long-term__. I find that if the story grips my imagination (and I have a good writing partner to scheme with) I will keep having new ideas.\n\n\n### My \"style\" (or lack thereof)\n\n\nNow even though I appear to have written a short story about each character, I hope I haven't come across like a dictator. I do in fact highly value world and character building as a team sport. Any potential partner of mine should know that I want to them to feel like they can truly make their character their own.\n\n\nIn addition to this, I am always happy to discuss ideas and suggestions for additions or alterations to the plot and general universe of the story. After all roleplaying is supposed to be __collaborative__ storytelling!\n\n\nThat being said I do have a \"style\" that I stick to while writing, so if you are interested, I ask you at least consider agreeing to it as a rough frame. I write in third person, past tense, and usually in reasonable detail and length (who would've guessed huh...). Literacy is rather important to me, so if you enjoy a very fast paced, short reply style, we probably wouldn't match too well.\n\n\n### Wrapping things up (omg finally!)\n\n\nFirst of all, if you have made it all the way down here, congratulations and thank you! Give yourself a pat on the back! I do truly appreciate people taking the time to read through my ramblings.\n\n\nIf you are still around, I take it I have managed to at least slightly peak your interest. (Yay!) If you have questions, suggestions, comments or (constructive) criticism but aren't sure if this is the roleplay for you yet, please don't hesitate to contact me!\n\n\nIf on the other hand, you've come away from all of this with the firm belief that you and this story are made for each other... same goes, please send me a message and say hello!\n\n\nI look forward to your messages.\n\n\nx Alex",

I recently read a high fantasy series with a disappointing end and now I'm ready to jump back into the genre and write a character with everything my little heart can handle. \n\nThings I specifically liked about the series I just read: \n\n* Included typical fantasy races (specifically an Elvish-like race)\n* Had a very large, overarching humanitarian goal\n* Most of the primary party were \"bad guys\" caught up in helping others\n* Had a romance aspect (love an antihero/optimist pairing) \n\nNone of those are necessary for us, just things I loved about it. I'm open to jumping into a world you've already created, using a classic like the Forgotten Realms, or brewing our own together. You can use one of your previous characters or create one from scratch. I'm alright with some minor fandom stuff, but you'll have to convince me since it's not my preference. \n\nI write third person, in the past tense, and in multiple paragraphs at a time (I'm not going to give a word count\u2013 that's so stuffy). Usually I find it more fun if my partner takes the \"GM\" role but at this point, I'll compromise on anything. It seems like I've covered all the bases, but if you've got questions, you know how to reach me. Hope to hear from you soon! \n\n\n\n^[The ^book ^series ^was ^Symphony ^of ^Ages. ^Read ^it ^for ^a ^fun ^world ^occupied ^by ^an ^annoyingly ^perfect ^protagonist ^with ^awesome ^companions ^and ^illogical, ^simplistic ^solutions ^for ^complex ^problems.]",

In the extreme political unrest in both the Jedi and Sith a new faction has arose the Gray, a faction of force users whom believe that both others are extremes and balance can be achieved. \n\nThis new order has become the voice of the neutral worlds slowly growing in power and influence they strive to keep peace In those worlds and have begon to be a mediator between the two other orders.\n\n\nSo yeah I'm looking for a fully original star wars setting either set long before the movies or long after at a time where we dont have to worry about canon. If this intrigues you would love to hear from you and open to ideas and changes youd like to make.\n\n\nA bit about me. I'm from western Canada and have had a good bit of rp experience but just coming back from a bit of a hiatus.  I usually respond with a paragraph or two unless shorter replies are better suited at the time. As for platforms to rp on I'm pretty open to what work for you.

As we approach the body to investigate it vanishes in a black mist.\n\nConfused and dumbfounded we go to report the deed, only to find the deceased party alive and well, leading to further confusion.\n\nSo this first plot is a nice little conspiracy, shapeshifters are invading and taking over positions of power, this will lead to us trying to uncover and the plot before the shapeshifters take over.\n\nMany years ago the world was ruled by the demon king Satanael along with his seven deadly sins and demon armies. The only thing that managed to stop his iron tight grasp was the combined forces of ten great wizards who managed to seal away the demon king and his underlings, however this came at a great price for the wizards, they each sacrificed their bodies becoming keys for the seal which holds the demons.\n\nWe now jump forward in time, worshippers of the demon king have began to gather the 10 keys, having four within the grasp, they plan to release Satanael and have him rule once again.\n\nNow in this prompt we would ether play as the king\u2019s elite squad, sent out only on the most dangerous of missions or a group of adventurers coming across the plot and feeling a need to stop the resurrection of the demon king.\n\nThe third and final prompt involves us playing as already existing adventures who have suffered their most devastating defeat, this leads to us being sold off to some foreign island where we work as prisoners trying to find some way to escape the island and captivity.\n\nSo those are my prompts.\n\nNow what do I expect from you? Well not too much actually, all I ask is you be enthusiastic and for your post length, just give me something to work with, that\u2019s all. \n\nI enjoy using 3rd person however I am always fine with playing in the 1st.\n\nI\u2019ll mention once again I\u2019m not married to these ideas. I hope at least one of them has tickled your fancy, so please just send me a message, I\u2019m friendly and don\u2019t bite :)",

I\u2019m looking for folks who want to write a story together for a few RP\u2019s I\u2019ve been wanting to do for a while now. :) Please see below and thanks for reading!  Note that I am only looking for partners over 21! Rping with anyone younger makes me uncomfortable.\n\n1. Legend of Zelda - I love BoTW and all other LoZ games! I would love to do an RP in this universe BUT with OC\u2019s. The hero can still be a reincarnation of the older heroes and the royalty with the goddesses blood. I also am happy to play a female hero with a prince or the typical male hero and princess! Similar to how the trailer for the second game is though, I want the royal fam and hero to travel together to stop some evil force. We can work out the details together! (Also open to m x m pairings here as long as you don\u2019t do the typical \u201cmy oc bottoms only\u201d thing!) \n\n2. Kids vs The World - Very inspired by Hunter x Hunter but I would love to do an RP with two kids on an adventure or quest, even with the world against them. This doesn\u2019t have to have romance, it could be two boys and a bromance, etc. (IMPORTANT: no real romance until the oc\u2019s are older, thanks)\n\nPM me if you are interested! I only use Discord, thanks. :)",

I'd love to roleplay with someone who is comfortable writing multiple side characters, as that is something I also enjoy.\u00a0\n\nThis is kind of an esoteric request but since I'm feeling it again, I thought why not put this up to see if there is any interest?\u00a0\n\nI'm looking to play\u00a0Fenris from Dragon Age after the events of Dragon Age 2. The concrete plot and specific timeframe is flexible but overall, I\"m looking for something\u00a0extremely character driven that explores Fenris going out into a world and becoming a man whose thoughts and actions don't (simply) revolve around Hawke. Basically, I'd like a roleplay exploring Fenris finding his own place in a world on fire.\u00a0\n\nThe character who I play him against is also flexible. I want to preserve Fenris' canon characterization while organically expanding upon it. Since I'd love if romance is eventually part of this, I'd like to be a little pickier on what type of characters I play him against (I am not interested in writing him against Anders in a romantic capacity). My thoughts are:\u00a0\n\nSebastian Vael. I think they had a very understated bond in DA2 and would love to explore a scenario where Fenris takes Sebastian up on his offer to come to Starkhaven and become a trainer of the militia/guards. We could then play out the political intrigue that comes with Sebastian taking back the throne\u00a0*** I would love it if someone would do this with me\n\nMale Mage Hawke. It could be interesting to play the events that led to Hawke leaving Fenris and getting himself stuck in the Fade -- and beyond, with Fenris showing up at Skyhold unannounced one day.\n\nYour original male character. Something starting between DA2 and DA3 or after Hawke dies in the Fade. I imagine Fenris would begin by aimlessly hunting slavers and Tevinter Mages across Thedas until eventually, he starts to form his own goals and ambitions that will eventually drive him to become his own man. Partnering with a mage hunter? Some sort of globe trotting adventure? Yes please.\n\nOtherwise, pitch something to me?\n\nIf you DM me, please tell me a little bit about yourself and your writing style, what you'd like to get out of this roleplay, and your idea for a character to play. I'd love it if you throw any cool ideas my way too. I also might want us to exchange writing samples so we can see if our styles mesh together. Thanks!",

Manowar.\n\nDark Horse: Hellboy and Abe Sapien. \n\nMoving on to the boring rules part of the post, I'd like for my partners to be detailed. I average about 500 words per reply, and would like for a partner that could respond within a similar range.  I also ask that my partner be fine with mature themes, as I like being able to portray the character without many restrictions. Some of the characters I roleplay as can be violent, have drug issues, curse a lot, etc. I'm also not really interested in roleplaying with any OCs, sorry.\n\nThat pretty much sums up everything that I wanted to say. If this post interested you at all, please send me a message. I look forward to exploring some comic book worlds!",

I prefer responses that is strong and long, instead of the short, no effort responses I tend to get sometimes.

I'm not asking for much, just that special magic that can happen rarely when two talented minds meet a blank page and tackle it together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Come wander with me through worlds of our own making.\n\n# \n\nI am going to try and keep this as brief as possible while still offering as much information as I can so you can decide whether or not you think we'd mesh well before shooting me a PM.  &lt;3 **Bolded big stuff so you can skim, though**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 6/17/19-  UPDATED CRAVINGS/IDEA SNIPPETS SECTION\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Also please don't comment here, PM me if you want to communicate about anything written below.**\n\n# \u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\n\n# The big compatibility stuff/my preferences:\n\n**\u2661** I have been doing RP/one on one writing in some capacity or another for **\\~19 years**. It's why I can write to what I humbly believe to be at least a **somewhat decent** level. Being able to write every single day for months on end for more years of my life than not has given me invaluable experience in character creation, development, world building, narrative, all of it.\n\n**\u2661** I mention this because I would very much prefer it if you are also **literate** to **advanced literate** in your writing. I ask that you are fairly experienced with a firm grasp of spelling, grammar, and storytelling. I **don't** ask that you be perfect, I am a **better storyteller** than I am at grammar and punctuation and all that, tbh and as a warning. I'm gonna make glaring mistakes because the words were just rushing out too fast and I was blinded by the vision of the scene and the things I was trying to convey, but I do try my best.\n\nAll that to say again, we're both human, perfection isn't being sought here, but just write good, k?\n\n**\u2661** I use chat-speak in **ooc chatter**. I ramble. I overshare and brainstorm and will flood your messages while you're away\n\n**\u2661** I am **only** interested in **hetero romance** pairings. I know, ew, str8 ppl. But the heart wants what it wants, as we all know.\n\n**\u2661** I prefer **Discord/e-mail/G docs/PM** **of some sort** for the actual writing and **Discord** for ooc chatter and brainstorming.\n\n**\u2661** I **\\*really\\*** am not comfortable working with anyone younger than around **\\~22+** Like, I have **zero** interest and it'll be a flat **no** from me. Sorry.\n\n**\u2661** I do **lean** towards **favoring female writing partners**, trans women, of course included as long as you are willing to play cis males opposite my character. That's the **main requirement.** Not only a **willingness** but a **desire** to play a **male character in a romance story with a cis woman**. I just enjoy how easy it is to get on the same page with another woman. I won't turn you away BECAUSE you're a guy but we're less prone to get on, I have found from experience. My last two long-term writing partners who I cherish dearly were female. If you're a talented writer though who loves romance and drama and world-building, don't hesitate to shoot your shot. &lt;3\n\n**\u2661** I do **only** play female main characters, and I understand if that is frustrating to you, but that is my preference. If you don't enjoy playing the main male roles, **do not PM me**. I'm not about asking you to do anything you don't want to do. If you don't want to...please don't.\n\n**\u2661** I don't know if this is a given, but I also ask that you **help** me populate the **side-characters** as needed for our world and our stories.\n\n**\u2661** **I do not like pre-made characters**. I expect that **all** characters used in our stories are made expressly for those stories.\n\n**\u2661** I write in **third person past-tense POV only**.\n\n**\u2661** I **only** use actors and models for **character references**.\n\n\u2661 I do **not** have many limits for adult themes and I do **not** fade to black but there must be a balance between those themes and storytelling, tipped in the favor of good, amazing storytelling and all the drama and pain of whatever situation plagues our characters. Please include your **NSFW** preferences in your introductory PM. **\u2661**\n\n**\u2661** SO yeah, just to make it a bullet point, I prefer **long-term** writing partners. We can certainly do **one-offs** for cravings, and leave and come back to stories and worlds and plots as we please, we are after all in charge, but I prefer to have one or two steady people I can turn to when I want to work on something either creatively for a few months or to satisfy a craving in the moment that may or may not turn into something long-term we work on or come back to.\n\n\u2661 **Please don't invite me to your group role-plays**. &lt;3 Thanks so much for the thought and I am flattered but I am only interested in one on one stuff for now. The most I would consider is maybe occasionally working together with a third party if you wanted to bring one in on discord someday.\n\n**\u2661** I **don't** tend to like **canon characters**. I will take ideas from characters and build something new around that, something similar, but still mine. I will also do this with settings, worlds, drawing from TV and movies and comics and books, etc. But I will never play a canon character and for me to play opposite one, as in you playing a canon character, would have to be a huge crave or a lot of convincing and pretense and plot that I like.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Take a look at what I am interested in actually writing just below, and if you find your interest piqued further and want to delve into any of these worlds with me and create some characters, get right into it and start brainstorming and seeing if we vibe, please send me a PM. Introduce yourself. If you have writing samples, send them. If you have questions, ask them. Ideas? Tell me them. \u2661\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What I want to actually write/loose plot/setting/character ideas -\n\n# \u2661\n\n**My biggest crave at the moment:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSomething with some pretty **heavy sci-fi/space** themes. A crew waking up on a colony, or scientists and colony members waking on either a ship, a colony, or a new planet. Borrowing some themes from some of the Alien and Bladerunner films would be a lot of fun. This is a big crave at the moment. I would love to develop this with a talented partner. Maybe adding in some elements of Handmaid's Tale or something else to make it ours. I have a few more ideas. **\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u2661\u2661\u2661\n\nMy next biggest crave would be something set in a remote location. I see a cabin surrounded by a seemingly endless landscape of snow and ice. Think North of the wall in GOT but in modern times, a few years into the future, likely after a shift because of climate change so maybe even someplace that was never historically even nearly this cold, thus why our characters would be stranded there and have to learn some of the skills they learn to survive without knowing them by heart or with mastery. Maybe they meet not too long after the freeze which would have been sudden and apocalyptic a la that movie Day After Tomorow, and they're both barely hanging on. Maybe my character is a bit more established and takes yours in. We can iron out the meeting but I know I want a fairly gritty story with drama and danger and love and survival and some slice of life elements mixed in too, as being perpetually buried in snow leaves much time to pass and skip around and play in while they're just inside their refuge.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would like to see my character paired with a guy who is at least a few years older than her. Maybe he does have some survival skills/knowledge but he is injured either by her while she is hunting or when he arrives and is thus incapacitated, so she takes him in and heals him. He could trade that knowledge for shelter and safety and medicine and besides, if she shoots him it would give her a greater feeling of obligation to help him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's just a few loose ideas at this point and I would love to brainstorm with you to iron out the details if this world and fragments I'm describing sound appealing. Picturing lots of snow, ice. Lots of danger in the cold. A romance that comes maybe unexpectedly but certainly inevitably after a medium to slow burn. Then maybe a family, a story of generations surviving. I like to take stories we tell on their own and once they've sort of run their course then open them up, expand on them. I like to add generations, tie things in with small details and in as many ways as I can organically work in. Even if we're someday telling a fantasy/sci-fi story, I may find a way to tie it back to this story.\n\n# Other fragments of ideas:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\u2661\u2661** **Westworld** \\- Two guests meet in the park (doesn't have to be exactly like the one in the show) and fall in love. Adventure and danger and lots of fun and drama could be outlined for this easily. Open to some light sci-fi elements for this one. very subtle things, nothing too overt.\n\n**\u2661\u2661\u2661 RDR/The Revenant/Western US in the 1800s** \\- Pretty straight forward, just delving into a romance set in the wild west. Instead of being in a park and from a modern or futuristic present, we'd be dabbling in some historical fiction.\n\n**\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661** **Cold Mountain/US Civil War era** \\-   More specifically the civil war era in the southeastern US, all the way across the country from the above mentioned western US setting and a bit earlier. The 1860s. Different than the Western idea in that this would likely be set in the Appalachian Mountains. I imagine a lot of hardship, survival, hunting, war, love, etc. Not actually based on the book or the movie. Just the source of inspiration for a world for us to play in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese would need to be developed a lot more, but I truly love that kind of collaborative development of plot and characters, so that's fine by me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u2661 No matter what kind of world and characters we work in and with, I want a heavy, unforgivably human type of story that will ultimately reward us with a beautiful narrative and characters that feel real and alive. Hopefully a friendship and/or writing partnership. Maybe the start of a whole new world we can dabble and play in at our leisure. That's always my hope.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want beauty and heartache and pain and drama and love and yeah, I want a little magic but not in the fantasy sense of the word. I want the magic of two creative, talented minds working together for a common goal and breathing life with words. I want a nice slow to medium-burn of a love story to start out hopefully many lovely stories we can tell together. There are universes to be made.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have characters already kind of fleshed out a bit in my mind and some ideas for side characters and plot and backstory and such for the craves listed here, depending on what your character is like and what we decide of course on for the tone and plot. I want some elements of slice of life, but forward-driving plot at a decent pace. I write with as much depth, detail, and color as I possibly can but sometimes it will be more casual, sometimes it will be really lengthy, just depending on mood.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**If any of this sounds good to you, please don't hesitate to PM me and we can go from there. Most of the above can be worked out.**\n\n# \u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\n\n# Bonus rambling:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u2661 Usually having the male main character at least a couple of years older than the character I am playing will end up being my vibe. I like to make female characters that challenge and assert against men who might consciously or unconsciously use age as an excuse to dismiss or otherwise silence or stifle them at the beginning, or if they're not the type sometimes also perhaps to use that juxtaposition of age and character for fun because of some of these societally pre-conceived notions, etc.\n\n\u2661 Taking breaks for burnout is totally fine, I will probably take a couple over the course of say, a year, and that's why I prefer having long-term partners. Ditching though, I don't appreciate and try not to do myself. Just let me know, I get it. We're human beings with lives and mental and physical health needs. Or maybe we just aren't meshing? Don't sweat it, just tell me. I will certainly try and do the same.\n\n\u2661 I can get **very** into world, mood and character building and have in the past collaborated on playlists, character references, setting reference, mood boards, etc. with writing partners to help expand on the world based on the mood, using these things as a way to further get on the same page so we can write in both the same tone and from the closest that I think two minds can probably get when working on one world together from two totally different upbringings, sometimes writing styles, background, history, experience, mood, locations in the world, etc. There are a lot of variables, but I feel like discussing characters and setting and vibes and themes you want to include and songs that make you think of a character or a moment or a feeling related to the story and all of that can level some of those variables and bring two people to the same place creatively. It's magic when it happens, and if you've experienced it you know it, and I guess that's what I am looking for again. A little magic, no big deal. Right?\n\n\u2661 I like to tell stories that can sometimes span generations. Maybe even time and space. But most important, stories about families and characters that feel real and who come to life for us. I like having things that I write with long-term writing partners eventually be woven together in some way or another, so that it's a cohesive world, even if in one story we're dabbling in Science Fiction and then in another maybe historical fiction or slice of life or anything in-between. I love doing stuff like that and being collaborative about world building and borrowing characters and adding generations and ancestors and relatives to families as we go and as the opportunity arises no matter the genre or era we are writing in. I've yet to meet a plot line I can't at least loosely tie together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# PM ME NOW IF YOU'VE MADE IT THIS FAR! \u2661",

Meanwhile, Ralsei would find himself displaced beyond imagination, in a strange world of mighty Human kingdoms, and terrible otherworldly beasts of untold ages.* *For him, it would be many, many years before he saw anyone familiar...\"*  \nHeigh-ho.  \nI'm an eighteen year old writer with some seven years of experience under my belt. I strongly emphasize realism in all forms of my writing, from combat to conversation, and take great pains to try and make sure I am doing a character's natural personality justice!\n\nI've been an avid UT/DR RP fellow for a good while, and recently conceptualized an idea for a peculiar take on an experienced latter-teenaged, wizardly Ralsei, as well as a potential world for him to be in. I'm primarily a game-master type, however I can certain step down and hand you the reins if you'd like!\n\nI don't care terribly about writing size, so long as you're interested and are doing more than one-liners. I'm certainly patient (or at-least would like to think of myself as patient), but most every roleplay I've participated in on this platform has led to me being ghosted, so don't take it too personal if I might be a bit paranoid about that for a while!\n\n**So, some potential scenarios (taking place in this aforementioned world) I am thinking of include:**\n\n* Ralsei reunites with either Kris or Susie (Or both, if you want!)\n* Ralsei meets an Asriel traveling into the Dark-World!\n* Ralsei meets an Original Character of yours!\n\nWhile I am planning on this world to be somewhat dark and \"heavy\" in following a tone of realism, if you have an idea in particular, I would be more than willing to do something lighter and calmer (so long as I am able to write this particular Ralsei with all his quirks!) I am not easily fazed by many things; I am capable of writing gore and grievous injury, or keeping it a more Tolkien-style vague.\n\nI'd be willing to do romance or similarly 'fluffier' stuff potentially, but I wouldn't be able to do it in a MxM context or with a real-life male; that would be a bit too strange for me. Consider this particular Ralsei straight as an arrow. As for the subject of NSFW, I am inexperienced and somewhat prudent in that field, but would be willing to write it if it ever naturally got to that point.\n\nAside from all that, I think that's pretty much it!\n\n*^(don'tgodmodorpowergame, don'tberude, and don'tghostmeplssayifyouwannaleavedontjustghostmeaaaaa)*\n\nIf my little idea really interests you, shoot me a PM and tell me a bit about yourself! :-}",

The world is full of magic, monsters, spirits, and demi-humans, as well as ton of things out to kill you. \n\nI can't provide a more in-depth explanation of the plot because I don't want to spoil it since its up to you and your character to discover and unlock its secrets, for the possibilities it holds are limitless. I will warn that the adventure might be graphic, gory, and violent when the time comes, because I am sadistic and gain enjoyment from the suffering of your character and also its important for the plot (You will have to find out just what that means). I hope to find someone who wont be scared away by this fact.\n\nI normally respond in lengths depending on what is currently happening in the roleplay. Normally the answers will be 2-10 lines since I have all the time in the world at the moment. I usually answer within minutes since I am never particularly busy. When there is more going on in the roleplay, of course, the answers will be much longer and I always do my best to type as much as possible. Im more of a casual roleplayer in that I dont write an entire novel in one response, instead relying on a higher quantity of posts.\n\nThere are also a few other conditions. You must roleplay in First Person. I am only really looking for male characters to be played, for I don't have any experience with FxF. I am\n\nI am looking for someone who will take this as seriously as I am intending. I want to put a lot of effort into this but I cant do it unless my partner is willing to support me by giving as much effort as I am. This means if you don't reply to the rp within 2 or 3 days (without giving notice), I cannot guarantee that I won't move on and find someone else. I don't like constantly bothering people or reminding them to answer the roleplay. I didn't put it all together for nothing!\n\nYou can DM me for my Discord. Thanks for reading, I hope we can work together and have fun!",

I tend to copy my partners length; but sometimes I\u2019ll write my own length of several paragraphs if needed. (:\n\nI\u2019m interested in tons of kinds of roleplays; varying from action, anime, romantic, dramatic, sci-fi etc. My favorites would have to be action and romance, but I\u2019m really open to a lot of other things, just throw them at me and I\u2019ll most likely be interested in it. \n\nI write in first person but I am open to writing in third; first is just my preference. I prefer responses that is strong and long, instead of the short, no effort responses I tend to get sometimes. I understand that people have busy lives so they\u2019ll only be open to sending one to two messages a day; so that\u2019s why I like long-term we we can respond on our own times!\n\nI\u2019m available to roleplay both on here and on Discord; just please let me know which one you would prefer when you message me.

            "selftext": " Hey there! I\u2019m \\[REDACTED\\], one of the co-owners of Persona: Labyrinthine of Sin!\n\nOur server has recently opened up, and we are looking for new members to fill up our Persona roleplay server! Now, one may wonder to themselves that if Persona only has 7-9 protagonists who use personas, and the rest are average joes, how will this roleplay be entertaining for everyone? Well, you see, in the Labyrinthine, EVERYONE gets a Persona. There are three factions within the server, each of which has 10 slots (we will raise the slots if we gain a lot of attention).\n\nThese are the three factions for you to choose from!\n\n* **The Trailblazers:** These are essentially the main protagonists of any Persona game. While they are most likely the easiest choice to make a character for, they also start at a disadvantage since when the campaign starts, this group still does not have their Personas.\n* **The Labyrinthine Investigation Unit (AKA LIU):** This group is a branch of the \u7279\u6b8a\u4f5c\u6226\u7fa4 (Tokushusakusengun), which is essentially the Special Forces of Japan. They are composed of veteran Persona users, all of which have had their Personas for a few years at this point in the story. These individuals have worked together on other \u201csupernatural\u201d phenomenon relating to Personas and Shadows. LIU is going into the Labyrinth to learn how it was created, who exactly created, is it a danger to humanity, and if so, can it be destroyed?\n* **Faction Three (Unnamed):** This group is currently unnamed, as the members of the group will vote on a name for it before the campaign starts. This group was made by the main antagonist of the story (Nev Urey) to act as guardians of her Labyrinth. This group was intentionally composed of individuals with low morals, as Nev Urey wants them to do whatever she asks of them, be it capturing LIU members for a sacrifice, or slaughtering the Trailblazers.\n\nNow, you are probably wondering to yourself two things: Why on Earth are people going to this place, and why am I now referring to it as a campaign and not a roleplay when earlier I was calling it a roleplay? Both questions have relatively simple answers. For the first question, Nev Urey has promised The Trailblazers that there is an item at the top (she did not specify what it was, she only said they\u2019d know it when they see it) which can grant them one wish of any proportion\u2026and she told Faction Three the same thing. While Faction Three is supposed to be guarding her Labyrinth, she also promised them that if they make it to the top before The Trailblazers, she\u2019d grant them the same wish. As for the second question, this roleplay is a roleplay, but it\u2019s also a campaign! It is largely story based with a focus on EVERYONE\u2019S characters, but we have an actual combat system that we have spent quite a while creating so that way combat won\u2019t be too easy due to anyone being allowed to do whatever.\n\nIf this short introduction to the server gained your interest, I ask you to check out the server itself! You have absolutely nothing to lose by checking it out, and if you like what you see you can always stay and fill out an application!\n\n[Click here to be taken to the Labyrinthine of Sin!](https://discord.gg/7my2qcS)",

Though I would rather not spoil the contents of my story, I can assure you that it will be an interesting experience so as long as you stick with me.\n\nI can provide a more in-depth explanation of the basic plot if nessesary, but I don't want to spoil it since its up to you and your character to discover and unlock its secrets, for the possibilities it holds are limitless. I will warn that the adventure might be graphic, gory, and violent when the time comes, because I am sadistic and gain enjoyment from the suffering of your character. I just hope to find someone who wont be scared away by this fact.\n\nI normally respond in lengths depending on what is currently happening in the roleplay. Normally the answers will be 2-10 lines since I have all the time in the world at the moment. I usually answer within minutes since I am never particularly busy. When there is more going on in the roleplay, of course, the answers will be much longer. \n\nI am looking for someone who will take this as seriously as I am intending. I want to put a lot of effort into this but I cant do it unless my partner is willing to support me by giving as much effort as I am.\n\nYou can DM me for my Discord or Telegram, whichever works best for you.

            "selftext": " \n\n\"Gregor, for the absolute last time, I will jettison you into the next passing star if you don't pick up those tools.\" Eva hissed over the airlocks of the bay doors as they parted for her heavy footfalls. \"And gods help you if there's a single molecule of oil left behind on my table.\"\n\nGregor had the look of an interstellar vagabond. He smiled up like a fool from his place in front of the holographic maps, each of his hands braced on the side of the table as the soft blue glow tinted his scarred features. The gentle pulsing of light theatrically illuminating and accentuating features that were less than handsome in one instance and strangely pleasing the next. His right arm was covered in intricate tattoos, all of them resembling the same geometric and cartographical complexities as the interstellar maps he had designed. His left arm had been severed at the shoulder, the deep scars descending down his clavicle and chest before his loosely fitting and oil smirched tank top hid them. His missing limb was replaced by a sleek metallic model etched in the image of lost tattoos.\n\nHe flashed her a toothy smile and pulled the screwdriver from the crook of his robotic arm to move the assorted modules and tools from the holographic tables. \"Goodmorning, Boss.\" he said in a playful tone around the cigar in his mouth as smoke billowed up around his nose.\n\nEva moved around the side of the maps that spilled light across the empty bridge, smacking the back of his head as she walked. Gregor smirked, rubbing the spot on his crewcut as the echo bounced off the wall of the cavernous room. \"Hey now, that's not friendly.\" His tone was laden with mock hurt as he watched the woman take her usual spot at the rear of the table.\n\n\"The crew will be back in a few hours, I expect you to put a good foot forward, Gregor.\" she said, picking up the screwdriver he had set down and wiping a touch of grease from the pristine table as the maps spiraled slowly overhead. Her eyes traced over the systems they had worked on for years. Starships, especially research and entrepreneurial vessels like theirs, didn't share maps. They were as personal and as valuable to them as trade routes were to the travelers of centuries past, and worth more than any amount of credits.\n\nShe reached a hand up to caress one of the ringed planets, causing it to spin and a note window to spring to life. It cataloged the lifeforms present on the map, their relative value, any and all resources of import, and destination time. Between the other planets were faint lines representing their travels of years past. The longer she held a slender finger to the planet the faster it spun and the more information was revealed. Additional windows sprang to life with pictures, dates, records, security information, hostility rating and recent encounters as well as successful trades made in orbit. It was an invaluable companion to her logs.\n\nEva closed the window and panned out of that solar system to reveal the galaxy as a whole. More systems were marked in similar ways. Lists of planets, noteworthy features and hundreds of path markers, but there was something more.\n\nOn a macro scale, the maps revealed colored territorial boundaries. They swallowed planets like clouds, claiming them as a part of an empire, a federation, a dictatorship, or sometimes nothing at all. These borders were rarely accurate with the constant ebb and flow of what had become interstellar imperialism, but it was good enough to know where they shouldn't travel. Besides, they weren't normally interested in places that already had colonies.\n\nOut of the corner of her eye, Eva could see Gregor smirk as she panned towards the edge of the colored borders, greeted by empty space and a few bright red marks, the most recent additions to the map.\n\nHe had been the one to convince her that the exo-planets weren't beyond their reach, and it had made all the difference in the world, but there were many sections of the map that were entirely blank. Something she hoped to rectify.\n\nUnderneath their own maps were the open sourced navigational maps that were open for the use of any starship. She illuminated the channels to show them at full opacity alongside their own, like layered filters on an existing three-dimensional image. It was always a gamble venturing into the outer-rim systems, but progress lived at the edge of the unknown with wealth as its close neighbor.\n\nGregor's voice pulled her from her thoughts \"I know we talked about it last night, but with the repairs done, I was thinking we head back out past the Haidrial system,\" he said and his fingers pinged one of the preset destinations, the zone beneath being completely unmarked as the map dissolved into shadow.\n\n\"Did we include Sarah in this discussion?\" She asked, leaning forward onto the table and staring up at the uncharted region of space. Sarah Escher was a Mana scientist and was absolutely essential to their deep space voyages. Their Heraldic cruiser did not run on nuclear energy, but mana cores.\n\n\"No, Boss, but I'm sure she's aware. I don't think we've run a local stop in over a year. She'll know you're not about to change course when we're making so much progress.\" he said and ran his mechanical hand over his face, \"Besides, if we hadn't needed repairs we would have still been in the comet field, we're back early so the cores will probably be pretty full.\"\n\nEva looked out through the windows of the observation deck and command center of her heraldic vessel and onto the port city of Sryin where roughly two hundred men and women were making their last-minute purchases or indulging more human appetites before their long journey.\n\nEva nodded and stepped back. \"I'll let her know, I need to see Props about my guns before the rest of the crew returns and we have to greet the new kids.\" she threw him a sharp smile \"And Gregor,\" she began as he turned to look at her, lips pursed and brow raised. \"I will not greet them alone.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I get it, I'll put on a shirt.\"\n\nShe glared.\n\n\"A clean shirt! Gods,\" He groaned as she turned to leave, \"But seriously, what did you tell the new guys, what do they think we are?\"\n\n\"We're a research vessel, Gregor.\"\n\n\"Yeah Eva, but whose?\" He asked, reaching up with his flesh hand to pan the map back to the territorial borders that divided the known universe, his head sinking, mechanical and flesh fingers outstretched and an expectant look on his face.\n\nShe stared at him. This old game. Her boots padded at the metal floor.\n\n\"Mine.\" She said, the airlocks hissing closed behind her as her footfalls faded behind the thick door, leaving him in a plume of his own colored smoke.\n\n\\---------\n\nHey there, thanks for reading the blurb. I'm Heather, and I'm looking for one person to play some stories with. I say some because I'm not looking to play out a single story, I'm looking to make a friend that is as excited about writing as I can be. I want to feed off one another and follow these ideas to see if they can't be fun.\n\nIdeally, I'll make a discord server, and we can have as many stories as we want, we can leave some if we're not having fun, we can come back to them with new ideas and a fresh perspective and we can have multiple going at the same time. That being said, I work a lot, and sometimes I get burnt out if we've been writing a ton. I put a lot of work into my posts and it can be exhausting. The post I wrote above was an introduction for a story with one of my best friends, but I figured if you don't like my writing than we probably won't be good partners because I do end up with a lot of longer responses. The stories end up being complex, I play a lot of characters to flesh out the world, and this isn't cheap wish fulfillment (though with a good partner we can definitely explore that). I get emotionally invested in the worlds, creating something realistic, thoughtful and believable and it can take a while to recharge so if you're not comfortable with that I understand but I'm not the person for you.\n\nThese relationships very genuinely wind up with me meeting my best friends. I play video games with a lot of my ex-partners and we still have a blast.\n\nI'm heavily discussing the type of relationship I'd really like but in terms of the stories themselves, I have written a bit of everything, the only thing I'm not a big fan of is slice of life. I marked the post NSFW because I have no aversion to smut, violence, or gore, and if we decide on a grimdark world for something, I will play it grimdark. Weak stomachs beware. I'm a huge fan of worldbuilding, lore, writing multiple stories inside the same world, playing with new motifs and ideas, so long as we build it together I'll be happy. I just want it to be a give and take relationship because I don't want to DM all the time. It's a lot of work and if we work on it as a team it's a lot more fun for both of us.\n\nSo there we are. If you made it through and you don't think I sound insufferable, you like my writing and you think we might be a good match to create some good original stories please message me. I have a job where sometimes I can respond 10 times a day and sometimes I can't respond at all. Life happens. I appreciate the patience and if you are down to play, maybe include a writing sample in your message? I know that sounds rude but I'm really looking to make a genuine connection with someone who makes me better and someone I look forward to hearing from. I don't expect perfection and if I'm really enjoying a story and I'm writing quickly sometimes I can miss small errors. It's not the end of the world, I just want to have fun with someone.\n\nBest wishes,\n\n\\-H",

I\u2019m hoping to find a role-play partner, that will, in their free time, indulge in descriptive storytelling surrounding an interesting, male/female love story that we can come up with together. I wish to have a partner that can spell correctly, use correct grammar (not that I\u2019m perfect all the time), as well as punctuation, capitalization, and be admirably descriptive in their writing. I don\u2019t exactly desire extreme novels to be sent back, and forth, just messages containing enough effort of description so we, each-other, can really understand, see, hear, and feel what\u2019s going on for our characters in the role-play. A lot of the time, I set up a role-play with somebody, and get so excited, because they seem super literate, and descriptive, and passionate about what they write, but then they shock me with one, little paragraph replies. I hope I don\u2019t seem too picky or anything, because I certainly don\u2019t nag anybody for writing mistakes, but I just want to receive the same amount of effort that I put into the story. \ud83d\ude42 I\u2019m also looking for somebody who prefers a build-up to NSFW. If there\u2019s no build-up, it has to at least contribute, and make sense with the story, which I wouldn\u2019t mind at all!\n\nI do have a list of role ideas, if you\u2019d like to have a look at it, as I would be willing to hear any of your ideas, as well! I\u2019m open-minded, and I hope you\u2019ll be, too. I seek honesty, and communication between me and my role-play partner, yet as for general communication and conversation apart from the rp, I\u2019m not MUCH of a talker. Of course, I won\u2019t ignore you OOC, I just have my intentions set more on the role-play, and getting to know your writing skills, rather. \ud83d\ude0a Hope that\u2019s okay! \n\nI do Discord only! If you\u2019re interested, please send a message my way, and please include your Discord username. It would also be a bonus if I saw a writing sample of yours! I like to check if my potential rp partner\u2019s writing style clashes with mine well. Hope to hear from you. \ud83e\udd29",

The theme is as followed: \n\nA mythical being has travelled between dimensions to study Earth. It\u2019s purpose was to discover humanities secrets disguised as a normal, everyday person. Eventually, this being manages to make a friend, that they eventually develop feelings for. After eventually develop feelings for one another, the truth comes out. The pair is left with the question: Will the beast give up its powers to become human? Or will the human leave behind its home world, to become a beast himself? \n\nAgain, I\u2019m sure open to changing things up! PM me or comment if you\u2019re interested.

            "selftext": "Hey there! Back again looking for some long term roleplay partners, as is the norm with RP quite a few of my partners have either disappeared or other issues have stopped them from being able to continue but that's part and parcel with this, right? I would love to start on some involved and interesting roleplays. I'm always interested in starting new roleplays with exciting partners! I've been looking over the past few weeks but I'm still hoping to get some more long term partners to build some interesting stories with. \n\nI mainly use Discord as a means of Communication and Roleplay as I feel it's an easy platform for me to use either at home or on the go. \n\nA bit about myself, I'm a big fan of reading, gaming, movies and writing and find roleplay to fit nicely in as a hobby alongside a most of them. I also like reading comics, especially Marvel and would be interested in doing something based on that world and characters, it could be as loosely accurate as we'd like. \n\n I'm also interested in a wide range of genres from science fiction, to more generic fantasy and espionage style roleplay just to name a few. My favourite genre overall is cyberpunk but it is quite niche and very rare to find a partner interested in it, so bonus points if you are! Other genre's / settings I'm interested in are Lovecraftian, Apocalyptic, Fantasy, Noir, Futuristic Sci-Fi and honestly anything fictional I'm most likely to be interested in it! Just give me your suggestions or idea's and i'll be happy to discuss and see what works for both of us. I'm honestly open to just about anything so don't worry about suggesting ideas!\n\nI also have numerous prompts on my profile, but they all lean more to an adult setting. I don't mind with our roleplay being more adult orientated or not. I'm fine with either, although I would like the roleplay to be somewhat mature in tone. Any sexual aspect would be depending on your preference. \n\nMy timezone is GMT (UK) and I should be free to talk and roleplay most days, if not then I'll try to make you aware as I feel communication is key. I work 24hrs (Nightshift &amp; dayshift) so depending on my shift I can be online at various times. If I don't message back after a day or two then just fire me a message to get my attention, it's more than likely something IRL has come up and I've just forgotten to respond. I'm not the type of person to feel annoyed if you're giving me a poke! \n\nI'm open to any ideas or discussions, just fire me a PM and we can see if we work out. Hope to hear from you soon!",

From fandom options to original plot ideas and I'm very open to hearing more.\n\nA bit about me. I usually do 3-6 paragraph minimum depending on what's going on in the rp. I prefer third person past tense but don't need to stick to it. No first person! I just can't get into it that way.\n\nHighly prefer more than one main characters paired, or at least side characters actually playing a role to help with plot progression but I do love multiple character mains pairings.\n\nI will list the link to the full search below so I don't flood a long post here. Feel free to DM me here or contact me via discord.

            "selftext": "**This  will be a persistent request I will repost on a near-regular basis. I  don't check Reddit often during the day, but I check it daily.**\n\nFirst, a few things about myself.\n\n33 years old, East Coast US, full time weekday worker (the whole 40 hours and more). Craving RP with any and all interested.\n\n*Please  don't be discouraged by everything here. Some things did require more  context to make sense, especially The Catch section. The best we can do  is try with each other. :)*\n\n***Basic Requirements and Options***\n\nThird person RP only, Discord is necessary.\n\nWhat  I seek is female characters (IRL gender does NOT matter) opposite any  of my males/females/inbetweens aka intersex characters. In what, you may  ask? Look below (anything in bold is a big want with me):\n\n\\-Modern (includes fantasy, **slice of life, drama. I love the whole \"love, marriage, baby carriage\" angle in any relationship I do in a story**).\n\n\\-Historical (**Medieval (vikings/Norse/Saxon/Crusades/Plantagenet/Tudors era**), Victorian/Wild West eras, **1940s/1950s/1960s play**)\n\n\\-Fantasy (this goes into either of the genres above)\n\n\\-Fandoms (Marvel/DC, **Final Fantasy XIV**, **Friday  Night Lights, Once Upon a Time, Game of Thrones aka A Song of Ice and  Fire, Peaky Blinders, Harry Potter/Fantastic Beasts/Wizarding World,  Vikings, The Last Kingdom**; others need ask. But PLEASE ask me  on the possibility of playing canon characters from these shows. There  is no guarantee I may be able to play what you want. Feel free to ask on  others!)\n\n***Writing and RP Style***\n\nAs  for visuals, I have gotten dependent on them. Superficial, lacking  imagination on images? It is. But I've played in public SLs over the  years who have regularly embraced them, so it's ingrained on me.  Usually, actors/actresses/models and the occasional art.\n\nI  favor adult writing and want the same from who I play with. Give me the  romantic, intimate, and everything beyond it in detail (those that know  what this means will get it :) ). I also enjoy players who like to talk  OOC.\n\n***The catch?***  \nI got it down to three simple statements:\n\n1. Embrace  communication. I love those who are around daily or near-daily. I also  understand that RL kicks in, since I have it happen too. I'll give a  heads up on anything, as long as I get one in return. And if I feel like  something isn't working out, I'll say so. I only ask the same in  return. We can work things out if we try!\n2. Be  open minded or cool. If you're bothered by being asked on what ages you  play, or a greeting given while you're on Do Not Disturb, or anything  petty like that, then please move on. I don't have patience for those  who exhibit negative responses to something that doesn't justify it.\n3. No  ghosters or flakers. You contact me and we work out an idea, I expect  you to keep vocal about it. You don't want to play anymore? Tell me so  we can both move on and I don't bug you with a couple of messages a day.  If I don't hear from anyone for a week (unless they give me notice), I  move on. They may contact me later when they are ready, but I don't want  to sit around too long and wait.\n\n***Conclusion***\n\nFeel  free to PM me for my Discord name or offer yours when you message (no  need to wait!). I apologize for the long winded post, but it's the best I  can do. Any interested folks who PM me, please throw in a \"marvelous\"  somewhere so I know my post was read rather than the title. :) I look  forward to meeting everyone!",

I have homebrewed a couple of game systems, which are simpler and I think more fun than full systems like 5e or Pathfinder, especially when trying to use them over text.\n\nAnyway, I have a couple of ideas for an RPG that I want to try, and I have a new scavenging/crafting system I want to try out, though it's still being worked on. (Differing loot tables for different areas/enemies, etc.) I have a few different options for game progression, and I have an NSFW option as well, if that's your thing. My specialty is science fiction (kind of like Fallout), but I like to throw fantasy elements in every once in a while to spice things up; make things more interesting.\n\nIn previous instances of me using this system, things have gone quite amazing, actually. I can safely say they have been some of the most enjoyable roleplays I have ever done. So much fun!  \n\n\nIf you want a new partner, GM, or player; feel free to hit me up and I'll hook you up with my discord. If Discord isn't your thing, I can make Kik, google docs, and probably some other things work instead.\n\nEpilogue: If you have any inquiries or question, feel free to ask. I like answering questions!",

            "selftext": "Hey! Thanks for your time~  Only recently have I gotten some free time and I'm re-posting this new thread to get a fresh start and hopefully get some good plays going!! Thank you for your consideration.. Onto the good bits~\n\n I've gotten bitten by the role play bug and I would love to find a few partners for role play over email or I've seen people using Discord now, so that's an option too c: . I like to get to know my partners and I like OOC chats and such while juggling our RP. So if we become friends in the process, bonus! Haha.  If not, strictly rp is great too. \n\nPosts don't have to be crazy long, just something with enough substance to give me inspiration to give you something good in return . So, between 1-3 paragraphs after an intro (since those tend to be a little longer, usually) should be just fine. Quality over quantity IMO so if it gets my brain pumping it'll be all good. I want this to be fun, not a chore. xD\n I'm a female, 26, who can play both male and female characters (human, half-human or some sort of non-human and anything in between?). I can juggle multiple characters including antagonists, protagonists, and side characters to move our plot along. I like to discuss possible goings-on in the plot with my partner so we can both fully enjoy our play. I enjoy the following things in my role play: adventure, action, character/world building, relationship building, fantasy, romance(PG-NSFW), violence, drama, blood/gore, playing as/with multiple characters, plot twists, using pictures for characters (not needed, but visuals can be helpful sometimes) and also descriptions.. I favor plot, relationships and story most of all, as the sexy stuff can come later when and if our characters click (if at all). Romance does not have to be anywhere near our rp. It does not have to happen at all, or it can totally happen lol. (: I'm comfortable either way. I usually play in 3rd person. Some things I like (in no order): Superhuman/super powers, vampire/werewolf/occult/paranormal (supernatural in general), fantasy epics, slice of life, modern fantasy, sci-fi, apocalypse (pre/during/post), action/adventure .. I like a lot more so feel free to bring ideas to the table. :3 It's a very very general list.. ^^; PM me if you'd like to discuss something~ Thanks for looking! Oh btw, I do not do fandoms as I do not watch enough TV shows to get a firm grasp. I prefer original stories and characters. Just an FYI! :)\n\n Can't wait to hear from someone!

Besides that I am a really good writer with a large vocabulary and would consider myself semi literate to literate at times but I do also enjoy quick pace dialogue and short messages or if wanted lots of description and paragraphs of messages, my preferred app to rp on is discord, and my favorite types of role-plays are romantic (love nsfw too) along with suspense and magic type role-plays. I am interested in doing a zombie apocalypse themed role-play this time but if you have another idea you\u2019d like to do I\u2019m all up for it, I love absolutely every type or rp and am not against role playing anything \u201cweird\u201d so if you\u2019d like to create lots of fun stories with me HMU! :)\n\nEtc about me- will pretty much rp with anyone but prefer someone my own age 13-20, will rp with males and females, I would like for us to keep in pretty constant contact since role-play is one of my favorite hobbies and if a story gets left alone for too long it gets me worried, but I do understand if there is a situation in witch you can\u2019t rp for a long time (we are all human), I\u2019ve been role playing for about 3-4 years now I\u2019m not sure, and besides that I am just a really kind social person who loves to write and make stories, HMU if you are interested in being my partner! :) -Riley",

            "selftext": "Hello r/Roleplay. As the title of this post states, I need help roleplaying again. I'm going to attempt to summarize my experience as a roleplayer, and if in the end you want to help me get back into it, feel free to PM me.\n\nWriting was always a joy of mine. As a kid, from around 8 to 10, I loved when my teachers asked me to write stuff, as it allowed me to let my creativity flow freely. My favorite thing, by far, was creating interesting, and unique characters. I loved thinking about their backstory, how they talked, acted, and moved in the world. It was this fascination for character development and design that led me to my first roleplay experience, on a little game called Graal\n\nGraal was (maybe still is?) a big mobile game, where you made a little character, and explored an open world. In this game, people would advertise for roleplay with their little overhead chat bubbles. My curiosity led me to the roleplay community, and from there, I was hooked. I roleplayed every day, with as many people as possible, doing whatever it is they wanted to do, for about 2 years. I was so happy with my ability to write freely, and with all the friends i had made, but i sadly reached a sort of cap. No one wanted to grow as roleplayers beyond a set point, but i did, and so i found reddit, and downloaded kik when I was around 12, maybe 3 years old\n\nKik was were I really grew into my self. I ran into more.. mature characters, and some extremely talented and interesting people. I continued to grow, and found myself so fascinated with it all that the hours became minutes, and days flew by. Roleplay became my life, it brought me both pain and comfort, happiness and sadness. I made friends in this time that I talked to for a long while. I eventually found discord, and did the same thing for a while, but then.. well, everything kinda stopped.. My friends stopped roleplaying, I couldn't find any groups that accepted my style, and the desire I had started to dwindle..\n\nAnd so, here I am 6 years later, left with little desire, but far too much passion. I love roleplay, I love it more than a lot of things. It got me through my hardest times, and brought me more joy than anything else in my life. Roleplay brought me peace, it brought me comfort, and infinite happiness, but something is just killing my drive, destroying my ability to find anyone I click with, or any group to call my own.. This is, hopefully, where you come in. I need help getting back into roleplay. I'm not quite sure what it'll take, but I know it involves, patience, open mindedness, and acceptance in abundance, so if you think you're that sort of person, do not hesitate to PM me. Alternatively, if you have a group that's looking for new members, and think it would be good for me, PM me about it. I'm into almost anything really, and if I don't know something, I was blessed with a mind that learns stuff, so I'll figure it out.",

You'll find a relaxed pace of life, quaint shops, friendly people, lovely sights.\n\nOh, did we mention monsters?\n\nOk, not so much monsters, per se. Not all of them. Most people in Potterstown are humans like the rest of us. But there's also elves, goblins, vampires, demons, shapechangers...maybe an alien or two. Maybe that's why the residents refer to their home as Monstertown, USA.\n\nStill want to visit? We hope so! We feature:\n\n- Unique and original lore and setting.\n- Near endless possibilities for races and backgrounds.\n- Friendly and helpful staff.\n- Compelling and original stories and adventures.\n\nMonstertown USA is a setting in which humans and non-humans have forged an agreement to live in peace and harmony together in a small American town. Can this noble experiment succeed? Will the fragile facade that protects the town from scrutiny continue to hold? Can mankind truly be at peace with that which it considers monsters?

If this is something that appeals to you, don't be afraid to reach out for more details. We have around 16 people so far and are always open to new people.\n\nThe Island of Dr. Moreau (or the Island of Lost Souls as the discord server is known) is based upon H.G. Well's original novel but with a few twists (including a reversal of the central idea) and a modern setting. Design your own human character, and see how they thrive and struggle against a mad doctor and his genetic experimentation on a remote Pacific island. Needless to say, lots of changes are coming.\n\nDuke it out with Epoch Pharmaceuticals' gallery of unstable scientists and scheming corporate suits. Forge new friendships and rivalries with the other islanders. Prepare yourself for an eventual final confrontation with Doctor Moreau himself. The choice is yours, should you choose to journey to the Island of Lost Souls.\n\nPM me if interested.",

            "selftext": "Decisions of a Man is the story of [Belial](https://i.imgur.com/r8Gxe2o.jpg), a  54 year old priest living in the suburbs of the large capital city Salkatein. \nDespite having lived here since many years, few know more than his name and face, never does he lose his composure, always standing straight, talking with well chosen words, calmly and only when truly necessary.\nThat's how it has always been, like a ticking clockwork, always at the same time, in the same way, never out of the ordinary. It seems.\n\nTimes are turbulent on your continent Heilland, almost a hundred years have passed since pioneers discovered another continent which they promptly called \"Weissburg\". \nIt wasn't long until they met the inhabitants of Weissburg, a humanoid race which calls itself \"Val'drith\", after all this time neither side has forgotten the bloodshed that happened back then, when the Val'Drith surprised the resting pioneers, which got scared, reaching for their weapons in their defense, scaring the invaders of their camp in turn. It didnt help that nobody understood each others language.\nIt was a misunderstanding gone ugly and both sides had suffered great losses.\n\nThat was the first spark which lit the flame of fear towards the Val'drith, the next few centuries rumours and stories were spread, exaggerated accounts from people who had seen Val'drith, some people made claims the other race might be of demonic nature, which has since spread across the entire population.\n\nSince King Zadkis allowed for Val'Drith to trade very limited wares and ensured their safety for 3 days on their land, hoping this would clear things up between his people and the Valdrith, slowly getting to know them, it seems to only have worsened the problem.\nFearful women and men turned to the church for aid, to soothe their worries, but it wasn't long until this led to corruption, some simply fearful, some power hungry, some out for profit. \nWhile King Zadkis is struggling to keep his power with people pulling and pushing around him, especially traders, curious minds and wealthy landowners urging to open borders for the Val'Drith, while a majority of people, especially common folk, urges for a total ban, if not war with the other race, Belial keeps going.\n\nBut even he struggles, even if it isnt noticeable. \nThe church has gotten increasingly suspicious and hard handed, punishing people known to give shelter to Val'drith, or selling food, clothes, one of the \"demons\" touched. \nBut not only people involved with Valdrith are at risk, all sin is being taken more seriously, eyes and ears spread everywhere.\n\nWhy is that important? Belial is a man devoted to god, but he also has always been a curious mind with an interest in medicine. A lot of alchemists and \"surgeons\", \"doctors\" have been exiled, even executed if their methods and ways are not approved by the church.\nIn the underground Belial treats people who are desperate, some deemed hopeless, he doesnt take payment,a afzer all he cannot gurantee anything with his experiments, the only thing he asks for, is to never tell anyone a word about him, he doesnt tell his patients his name, or shows his face.\n\nSo far, this story has mainly been about Belial, but here comes you.\nWho you are, is your decision, you might be an assistant, a patient, a fellow priest, maybe even just a baker, it just has to make sense for you two to meet. \n\nThe world is getting more hostile by the day and Belial keeps gritting his teeth, enduring the internal conflict between his faith in god and his personal ethic. \nWill you help him? Will you try to get him to stop? Maybe none of these?\n\nLet's find out.\n\nBonus pictures: \n\n[Belial treating a Val'drith](https://i.imgur.com/3N1HRnE.jpg)\n\n[Younger Belial tending to his bees](https://i.imgur.com/Lgj0Yc8.jpg) \n\n[\"Remember....\"](https://i.imgur.com/54RVHTp.png)\n\n-this roleplay is 18+, blood, gore, dark themes and sexual content are all possible.\n-\n\n-I prefer the other character to be male\n-\n\n-Romance isn't necessary, but welcomed\n-\n\n-Third person, semi literate to literate\n-\n\n-Discord, Whatsapp, E-mail, all possible\n-\n\n-I am not native in English so I might do a few mistakes, I welcome any corrections.\n-",

I\u2019m open to playing either role, but if I had to have a preference, it would be the female counterpart! I am also 100% open to doubling up because I want to make sure my partner is happy as well. I also prefer MxF, but am open to doubling up for a MxM plot! CanonxOC and CanonxCanon friendly :)\n\nFandoms: *preferred pairings in parentheses, other characters listed are ones I\u2019m capable of playing should you wish to double up :)*\n\nMarvel Cinematic Universe (Peter Parker/OC, Peter Parker/Scarlet Witch, Peter Parker/Michelle Jones)\nCapable of playing: Peter Parker, Scarlet Witch, Michelle Jones, Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Stephen Strange, Loki, Thor, probably a few others as well so just ask!\n\nHarry Potter (Draco/Hermione, Draco/OC)\nCapable of playing: Draco, Hermione, Harry. A few others as well, just ask because I\u2019m not confident with some!\n\nside note: for MCU, please note that the roleplay will be strictly based off or in the *cinematic* universe, where most of my knowledge comes from. I\u2019m not confidently familiar with the comics, so characters and storyline will be based off of the movies, but AUs are definitely welcomed!\n\nThank you for sticking around, and please send me a message if you\u2019re interested. Please let me know what you\u2019re interested in, who you\u2019re interested in playing, and if you\u2019d like to double up should you not mind playing as Peter Parker/Draco Malfoy for whichever pairing!",

Anyhow, let's get down to business.\n\nI'm looking for some a fun and interesting MxM roleplay. I guess I may as well lay down some basic information.\n\n***A little about myself***\n\n* I am from the PST timezone\n* I'm pretty active when it comes to posting and will try to do so multiple times a day\n* I absolutely love fantasy. Be it the possible settings, the magic, or just the numerous different creatures that one can play as, I just can't help myself.\n* I really only do MxM ships, so really sorry for those looking for FxM or FxF. This also applies to characters that identify as males since that's a whole separate situation and one that I am not personally willing to get into.\n* I am literate. When replying, my posts can vary in length from anything like one to two paragraphs, upwards of two entire posts on Discord. It really just depends how into the RP I am.\n\n***Things I expect from a partner***\n\n* I want someone that is also literate\n* I want someone that can write a good and compelling story, not just leaving all aspects of the plot to me\n* I'd like someone who I can volley posts with, someone who's active and has the time to have fun with these characters\n\nWhen it comes down to it, my wants are pretty basic. I just want someone who I can sit down with and have a good time with both of our characters. I have a plethora of characters, all vastly different from one another. From towering centaurs to ferocious werewolves, or even the charming demon I can play just about anything.\n\nHopefully, we can plan something out and get to know each other a bit better. If interested, feel free to leave a comment or shoot me a message, we can discuss things and exchange discord information there.",
