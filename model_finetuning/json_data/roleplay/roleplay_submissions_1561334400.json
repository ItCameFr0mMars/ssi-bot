Look, I know it's not the best look to mention that stuff but I'm just writing this to be as transparent and clear as possible because of the aforementioned event and also many people not properly reading or understanding my posts.  \n\n\nHey all, I'm Techno. I'm a New Zealander and Roleplayer, I say where I am from so you know my timezone and all, I've been roleplaying since 2013 or 2014, I don't exactly recall, I got my start on steam and 2013 and 2014 are a complete blur to me. I'm fairly detailed, not pages and pages but more paragraphs or as much is required, some people say I'm good at setting scenes and giving them detail but I honestly think I do a reasonable job, not trying to score brownie points by being modest, I just think I'm decent or reasonably talented.   \n\n\nI am Autistic, If I'm being obtuse or there's any problem, PLEASE TELL ME, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, I really hate people just leaving for no reason at all, Just tell me what the problem is, don't be scared to tell me if I'm doing ANYTHING wrong. Please, That's a big requirement for me, that you tell me if I'm doing ANYTHING to upset you, ANYTHING AT ALL. just tell me, please.  \n\n\nI have some original ideas and some fandom ideas pertaining to:  \n\n\nMarvel\n\nFallout\n\nOther Video Games  \nOther Stuff\n\nAnd Original Ideas as mentioned above  \n\n\nSo if you're interested, Don't mind my stupid jokes or personality, can be decently detailed and such, can communicate and want to roleplay with me and make my day/week it would be greatly appreciated.  \n\n\nHope to hear from you soon! :)",

My name is Bree, I'm in my twenties and I'm searching for a partner willing to work with me on this idea that's been stirring up in my head. I strictly use discord and I use third person, averaging about 1-2 paragraph responses. \n \nThe idea goes as follows... \n\nI've just moved into this big but pretty quiet village, have my own little cottage with a some neighbors in the middle of town and I meet you, one of my neighbors. You're the towns trouble maker and you eventually drag me on these wild adventures and near death experiences because you've finally found someone willing to put up with your antics. You actually turn out to be a really nice guy/girl and things can maybe happen, that's up to you.  \n\nThe word would be magical, but we wouldnt exactly have magical powers. Maybe we'd have wings or ears or tails, physical body parts, yesh? ... In my previous roleplays Ive given the OCs magic and it just seems kind of all the same. Maybe something different to where they would have to use weapons and go to doctors... Not use magic and can just heal. Like, real life consequences. Its still in the little fetus stage, i haven't gotten that far... \n\nUhm, as confusing as that was, it was kind of just a big word vomit of the ideas I have. I hope it was enough to get you to message me! Thanks in advance (-:",

I'm not sure why, but I'm really feeling it now. \n\nOur countries have been at war for decades. Few remember that they're even fighting for. Fortunately, you've been kept out of most of it. Your father, the King, is a kind and loving man, who would do absolutely anything for his family. Which is why he appointed a bodyguard for you. That's were I come in. \n\nI'm part of a brotherhood of assassins from the rival country. Even though I'm a young girl, I've risen to become one of the best assassins in the world. I've been sent to infiltrate your country's military, in hopes of gaining your trust.. and then killing you. \n\n*ALTERNATE*\nChristmas (or other holiday) is the biggest celebration in your country. A week-long festival ends with a masquerade ball for everyone in the kingdom. \n\nI'm there in disguise to find the princess and take her out. Unfortunately, she's also in masquerade and blended in with the crowd. \n\n-\nSo my hope is for our relationship to deter me from my goal. Failing an assassination means death, but I can't bring myself to do it. Lots of drama ensues.\n\nI hope this makes sense. I have trouble writing coherently like this. \n\nAnyway, I'd love to hear from you soon and create a super fun and adorable roleplay. \n\n*~Neo*",

I have about 8-9 years of writing experience and consider myself pretty literate. (4-6 paragraphs though also depends on what I am given. Could be more could be less.) \n\n**What I\u2019m Searching For** \n\nI am searching for someone who can write a well amount. I\u2019m talking around two to three paragraphs minimum. I understand dialogue can lessen this, but that doesn\u2019t mean you give me strictly dialogue and little detail. I also understand writer\u2019s block, but even then I\u2019d like to see the thought process behind the character and all that. I can't stress this enough. There have been multiple occasions where my partners start out strong but fail to carry out when it comes to length. These replies usually die down to a sentence or two and I will not tolerate it. I really want to grow as a writer and I don't see myself doing that when given a few sentences to work with. \n\nI\u2019m also looking for someone who wants to chat OOC. I love building a friendship with my partners and sharing pictures/music that remind me of our characters. If you find yourself to not be very sociable outside of character though, that\u2019s okay too.\n\nI will only roleplay on Discord and in third person. \n\n\n**What I\u2019m Interested In**\n\nSandbox! I\u2019m all for sandbox. It leaves a ton of room to do whatever we want, which means a long term roleplay. I almost always do dystopian future settings and possibly some fantasy thrown in there. \n\nI rarely ever do fandoms but I may be open to a Fullmetal Alchemist world with our own characters. It would take place after the events of the series and our two characters could be upcoming alchemists? We can talk more about the plot if interested.\n\nOther than that I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m interested in right now, I\u2019ve been kind of branching out due to partners having some pretty amazing ideas so I guess I\u2019ll just continue with that. Just throw whatever ideas you got at me and we can figure something out! \n\nI will not do modern, most fandoms, canon characters, historic, and/or smut (I prefer to fade to black). I can\u2019t think of anymore, but we can talk about that later. \n\nIf you're interested or just have questions shoot me a message. I hope to hear from you soon!",

I'm open to RPing on discord, PMs, twitter, email, whatever's easiest for both of us. I'd prefer to write in third person and only interested in partners who are 18+. I've posted this before months ago, but I'm trying again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't have a written out plot or anything, just an idea. It's mostly romance mixed with thriller. Ten years ago, when my character was only 18 years old she became the sole survivor of a brutal massacre that took the lives of five of her friends and boyfriend. The aftermath of the massacre was highly publicized, leaving her labeled a 'final girl' and her photo plastered in the news. She likes to believe that she's mostly gotten over her trauma, and convientently doesn't recall most of that night's events. But her Xanax and wine dependency, aloof behavior and complete unwillingness to talk about the murders say otherwise. Your character would be the first cop that shows up on scene and saves her life (his backstory and where he is now is totally up to you). The event bonded our characters and yours feels protective over mine. They keep in touch, but mostly over text/email, rarely a visit because your character prefers to keep things professional. Anyway, I was thinking what brings them back together is my character recieving a threatening letter. So now we can pretty much decide where to go from there! I have a basic idea of what happened the night of the massacre but I'm open to suggestions/ideas once we're in discussion. :) If this sounds like something you're interested in please message me!",

            "selftext": "Hello, witches and wizards of Reddit!\n\nAre you looking for a group of passionate, dedicated fans who love Harry Potter? Have you always dreamed of a simulation of going to Hogwarts, casting spells, meeting new friends and going on adventures? Want to write out your life exactly as you dreamed it would (and should!) be? Tired of waiting hours to get a reply on your roleplaying posts? Want to attend classes, play quidditch, and meet cool people, all in the same place?\n\nWell, this is your letter of acceptance to Model Hogwarts! Have a live chat with your professor in their office, or watch as quidditch game unfolds right before your eyes! Brew some Veritaserum, finish that essay on the Goblin Wars of 1812, and go stargazing up on the astronomy tower at night. For some more information please check out our [wikia](http://model-hogwarts.wikia.com/wiki/Model_Hogwarts_Wiki)!\n\nWhat's unique and awesome about Model Hogwarts:\n\n1. Everyone starts off as a First Year. Everyone gets to starts in the same classes and no one gets a shortcut to being a seventh year. This is awesome because everyone gets the same experiences! You and your class will become even closer because you all remember the time that exploded potion nearly shrunk all of your heads into pinpoints, and somehow you dramatically saved the day! We also make it easy to graduate. A year is 11 weeks, with 2 weeks of summer in between. You also get to choose how many classes you want to take. Are you the next Hermione Granger? Don't worry, we've got you covered with a time turner so you can take all seven classes! Are you more like a Neville Longbottom? You only have to take a couple and still pass the year! We understand everyone has different priorities and classwork isn't always on top.\n2. You get to choose where you are sorted. We're not going to place you in Ravenclaw just to get an even number of students in each house. We want you to thrive where you'll do best, and find a social environment of like-minded students. Because of this, you get to choose your house, and once you do, a whole world of opportunity emerges. House parties, study sessions, quidditch teams, and more are awaiting you, so throw on that Hufflepuff scarf and get ready to drink some butterbeer.\n3. We're at a point where we are an established roleplaying community -- Model Hogwarts has recently hit our two year anniversary! This is great because you have the chance to leave your mark on Hogwarts. While having the safety net of an established community with 200+ active players and systems and guidelines to guide you along your roleplaying journey!\n4. As an established roleplaying community, we have developed -- and continue to develop -- a variety of systems to ensure you have the best experience possible! This includes a variety of discord bots, including a spell bot (that uses a combination of a learning and dice-based system to determine whether or not you succeed in casting a spell), a stat bot, and a chocolate frog bot, just to name a few! We also have a variety of systems, including the tokens system which allows you to purchase special abilities for your character so that your character, and every character in Model Hogwarts is truly unique.\n5. We\u2019re welcoming to both new and experienced rpers. If you\u2019re new to RP it\u2019s okay! Model Hogwarts can get you started! We have a \\[detailed RP guide\\]([http://model-hogwarts.wikia.com/wiki/Roleplaying\\_Basics](http://model-hogwarts.wikia.com/wiki/Roleplaying_Basics)) to give you some tips and tricks as you begin. We also run a plot every year, so even if you\u2019re new to RP and shy, you\u2019ll have plenty of chances to join in on the fun!\n6. We want *you*. We're not picking you from a bowl of applicants, you're picking *us*. So ask us your questions, and we'll try to help you. We want Model Hogwarts to be the best experience it can be, and provide students with as many opportunities as possible.\n7. **New addition:** Post-grad! Love Harry Potter but rather not roleplay as a student? We understand! Now that we have our first group of graduates, we have created a post-grad system where anyone can play as an adult in the wizarding world. Here you can start as someone that has already graduated Hogwarts, and navigate the vast wizarding world. Want to work in the ministry, and become a department head? Want to be a dark wizard and try and take over the wizarding world? These are all possible with post-grad!\n\nHow to start:\n\n1. [**Join the Discord!**](https://discord.gg/56z6GMM) This is where the magic is happening. Meet your classmates and professors, roleplay, go to classes, fight mysterious ghosts, and get lost in the library. You\u2019ll get a week of \u2018Hogwarts Summer Camp\u2019 where you can informally meet your peers in you year and explore the castle without all the annoying upper years.\n2. [Check out our wikia](http://model-hogwarts.wikia.com/wiki/Model_Hogwarts_Wiki) for more information as well as some information about our classes, professors and some peoples\u2019 characters!\n3. Take a peek at some of the classes we offer! Classes are drop in, so even if you miss some you can still attend, but they\u2019re totally optional if you\u2019re more interested in roleplay! First years can currently attend the following classes:\n\nCharms\n\nPotions\n\nTransfiguration\n\nDefense Against the Dark Arts\n\nPath to Success in the Wizarding World\n\nHerbology\n\nHistory of Magic\n\nAs well as elective classes for third years and up!\n\n4) Please comment down below with any and all questions you have. We\u2019d be happy to answer them! We can\u2019t wait to welcome you to our roleplaying community!",

I just feel like you can't move the story very well if you're only responding once per day. I do not want anyone who is under the age of 21, because I do tend to get a little NSFW. That being said, any NSFW scenes are for the purpose of the storyline, not for you to enjoy later. I typically roleplay by email, but I'm not totally closed off to using discord. Typos are acceptable, of course, but I do prefer someone who can roleplay on a college level. I prefer to double or play female (though I'd rather double- I love being able to have multiple characters and have a well developed cast and story). I prefer modern fantasy, but I can do medieval and futuristic, too, if you would rather do that. I do not do any fandoms; it's just too much work for me to keep up with storylines. I'm pretty behind on all of my favorite tv shows and books and I like to create my own worlds more, anyway. I do have a few plot ideas to work with as well. PM me and we can go from there! :)",

            "selftext": "Hello all! I've posted this before and if our RP didn't work out or I forgot to PM you back, you can PM me again.\n\n(Full disclosure this is like the third time I've posted this sooooooo ya)\n\nHello all!\n\nI am looking for someone to play out a VERY specific dynamic with me. If you'd like to double up and do something that you are super passionate about, I'd be totally game--or maybe this has been the very thing you've been searching for and we are fated WHAT LUCK.\n\nOkay a few things about me:\n\n* I'm over 20\n* I live in America\n* I'm a professional, published writer (ask me about it after we get to know each other and you will never, ever, ever hear the end of it sorry in advance)\n* My time is SO OPEN RIGHT NOW IT'S LIKE CRAZY.\n* I love realistic romance above ALL ELSE. I would like to play the female in one M/F relationship and am happy to do another male/female for you in return as long as we come up with something cool and engaging. I actually super love playing guys, but I get burnt out only playing them.\n* I enjoy writing real life. So I love things that are hilariously funny, and things that are infuriating and frustrating, and things that are sad. I really, really love people. Like, a lot. I love writing about them. My favorite stuff to write is poignant stuff because I think sadness and longing and heartbreak and fear and the good that can come from those things is so extraordinarily beautiful.\n* I write third person/paragraph style, though my preference is rapid fire posts where we only post as much as we need to. I am quality over quantity every time--in fact, I LOVE surprises and not knowing and doing a lot with a little. The best writers I've ever written with have been able to devastate me with five word posts.\n* I am MORE than literate, but I write \"slow burn\" because I think good stories take time\n* My favorite settings are historical, sci-fi, fantasy (I looooove playing princesses, fight me), and slice-of-life.\n* I will do NSFW stuff but I'd really prefer for it not to be the center of the story.  I used to do that I am just... over it.\n* I RP by email\n\nOkay, what I am searching for is the \"tough\" male (your character) and the girl who \"changes\" him (mine). I love the idea of characters who are incredibly idealistic--yours thinks that mine is his savior, mine thinks that she IS his savior. But of course, we all know that things are much more complicated than that. This relationship will NOT be healthy and will probably crash and burn in the most spectacular of ways (I can't wait). Ideally, I'll run this plot alongside something that complicates it--it won't just be two people who bumped into each other at the grocery store, but I'm not opposed to that idea either. I am SUPER ready to write out some complex, screwed up characters who possibly actually make each other's lives worse! I am seeking someone who wants to write this out as realistically as possible, but also with great beauty.\n\nI also have an idea for a romance thing that I have really been enjoying living in my own head and writing with myself lol cuz I'm cool like that.\n\nI know that this next section will turn some of you away from me, but I want to be as open and upfront as I possibly can be. Here is what I am not looking for:\n\n* Partners who completely disregard me, my character, and my story. It's like I'm not there at all. If you'd like to write a novel, I wish you the best of luck, but I want to write together. This is the most common reason I lose interest in roleplay.\n* People who are mean and unpleasant or creepy and trying to hit on me. We are RPING. It is FICTION. Dude you don't even know what I look like I could literally be Cthulhu think of all the tentacles you'd have to deal with\n* Unapologetic godmodders. Everyone says that they don't godmod, and then people do. Do not put words in my mouth\n* People who are unwilling to try anything without plotting it to death first. Come ON where's your sense of adventure? Let's find things out together!! I also don't have much interest in spending long periods of time planning out dynamics. I like to strike when the iron is hot and get going.\n* I'm just gonna reiterate that point above--I really, really don't want to spend long periods of time planning. I lose 100% of my interest immediately. I write on the fly. I'm not a planner. I often don't even proofread my posts.\n* People who really aren't all that interested in romance and don't really have a passion for it\n* \"Flat\" writers. This is kind of hard to describe. It's writers who aren't particularly inventive or skilled. Oftentimes, their posts read more like textbooks than novels. I am looking for a writer who is LIVELY and VIVID and FUN. I am looking for characters to play against who are engaging and UNAPOLOGETICALLY FLAWED and interesting.\n* Somebody who doesn't really want to talk OOC. It's not that I'll be blowing you up every day with all my drama and woes, but I really like people who are fun to talk to online.\n* Somebody who only wants to write the hero. I find perfect characters to be so dull it makes me want to pull my teeth out. My favorite characters I've ever written against were actually so frustratingly flawed and broken that sometimes I actually CRIED over them. These are the characters I try (don't always succeed) in writing.\n\nAlso I have to tell you that if I don't think we are jiving, I will probably try to be honest about it.  Or maybe I just won't reply. Prepare yourself and don't get mean if I say so. I will be nice and it's not that you're a bad writer, it's just that I don't want to use up our time with something I'm not that into. It's a rare butterfly when two writers are equally invested in something, but darn it, I'm gonna chase that monarch to the ends of the earth\n\nPlease don't be intimidated by this. I've been rping for a very long time (eighteen years) and have spent most of that time writing stuff I'm not all that interested interspersed with a few plots that made me laugh, cry, ache, and RUN to my computer every time my partner posted. I want more of that--and I'm sure you do too. So if you're interested, message me and let's see what we can figure out. The best way to get my attention is by coming with an idea, a post sample, and a little about yourself. The BEST BEST BEST way to get my attention is to be funny af in your intro to me, either be like \"this is what I want\" or \"what do you want,\" and then we just do it while we're both amped.\n\nAlso if I don't reply don't be a rude piece of crap. :)\n\nWow okay this is a lot lol. Well, thanks for reading, whoever you are.\n\nPlease message me if you are interested!",

            "selftext": "I literally couldn't think of a better title than that, I swear.\n\n\nThat aside, Hello! I'm back, today looking for less of a prompt, and more of a...general search? I have no idea. Before I get into the nitty gritty, allow me to say a bit about myself. I'm a 20-something male with plenty of writing experience, about 6ish years or so. I'm the kind of guy who (proudly) sprouts absurd and out there ideas, literally just on a whim or the slightest bit of inspiration. Seriously. Sometimes I can get a little crazy. My post length is anywhere between 1-3 paragraphs, but I came definitely get more out if I'm feeling inspired.  I'm also, for whom it might concern, in the central timezone of the United States. That being said, I have a horrid sleep schedule, so I'll usually be up pretty late into the night.\n\n\nWith that out of the way, let me say what I'm looking for. I am (unsurprisingly) looking for a female partner to nerd out with, 18+ of course, just in case we *do* go down a NSFW road at some point (It's welcome, but I'd like to not to be the focus of anything). **I will not, under any circumstances, write with someone under the age of 18**. I'm not comfortable with it, and I'm sorry if someone out there disagrees with this. Additionally, I'm looking for someone that I can call my friend. All proper and business is boring. I like to freak out with my writing partners. Come up with dumb plotlines or AUs. If you're looking for something strictly professional, I'm probably not your guy.\n\n\n\nFinally, we get down to what I'm *really* gonna be vague on. As you might've guessed by the title, I'm looking for something fantasy related. What specifically, you might ask? I have no clue. I'm a sucker for romance plots, with an epic adventure hanging above our characters' head. Be it slaying gods, or sealing away an ancient evil, I can't get enough of it. I love all sorts of different fantasy races, too. Elves? Oh yeah. Demons? Sure! Any kind of Yokai? *my god, that'll press my buttons in juuust the right way*. That being said, anyone that brings an idea with **Kitsune** as a major emphasis will make me *very* happy. Anyway. If you have any existing ideas, please, throw them at me! I love reading through plots n ideas. Want to create something new? We can chat for a bit, and see what we both like.\n\n\nI'm rambling now, aren't I? I think I've gone on for long enough. If I've caught your eye, please, shoot me a message, and I'll get to you ASAP. Just be sure to include your favorite color in your title, so I know you got down this far. I won't respond without it, because I don't enjoy it when people don't read my post. Like I said, I'm usually around into the late hours of the night, so you'll likely catch me. Thanks for reading!\n\n\n(Oh, by the way, don't send me a message only saying \"hey I think we can work something out\" or the like. Tell me about yourself, have some energy. Those kind of intros give me life)",

I'm fairly active and can commit to at least one or two posts a day. I'd also like to think I'm relatively open minded, but let's face it--everybody believes they're open-minded until they come across something uninteresting. So, let's create something we both can enjoy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Preferred Genres:**\n\n* Dark Themes\n* Modern-Fantasy\n* Romance\n* Action/Adventure\n* Mind-bending\n* Horror\n* Comedy\n* Adult Themes\n\n*Huh. That list is a lot shorter than I thought it would be. Let's try this!*\n\n**What I'm NOT interested in:**\n\n* Slice of Life\n* Fandom Roleplay\n* Mary Sue characters\n* Annoyingly cliche underdogs\n* Writing for the sake of word count\n* School Settings\n* Cyberpunk\n* Non-Fantasy Medieval\n* Zombie Apocalypse\n* Complete Realism\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll roleplay will be done via Discord. I enjoy making servers for storylines, allowing us to keep our content organized. I should also mention that I prefer anime/drawing claims. Real life face claims creep me out, especially when someone references their character as Keanu Reeves. I just can't take anything seriously after that.\n\n**Current Craving:**\n\nI'm looking for a partner willing to play a compelling villain. Mind-Bending &amp; dark themes are kind of my jam right now. If this wouldn't really be your thing, I'm always willing to read other ideas if they consider my other preferred genres.\n\nThank you for reading. So long, and thanks for all the fish!",

            "selftext": "Hi everyone! I'm looking for someone to rp with me, possibly long-term which would be preferable. So, I've got 2 plot ideas and they're both set in the same futuristic sci-fi city. We can flesh out the details of the city together. \n\n1. Slice of life and possible romance: There's a brand new advertisement screen installed on the shopping boulevard of the city, right on the street level. It plays a constant feed featuring a digital AI woman who seems to be very independent. She features in the ads that the screen plays, like a digital actress. \n\nThe core idea that I have for this rp is that your character and mine (the AI woman) interact with each other and either become friends or maybe even fall in love. But how can she get away from her screen? That's something we'll have to find out. \n\n2. Action, slice of life. The military and some choice individuals can buy robot soldiers to carry out dangerous tasks. One such robot, a female one with a humanoid figure, is released from duty after she becomes outdated enough. While she doesn't exactly look human, she's released to live on her own after she's stripped of her weaponry. (This backstory can be altered to fit whatever we want the rp to be.) Your character and her meet, and so they can live together, go on adventures, whatever we can come up with! \n\nYour character can be pretty much anything/anyone in either of these plots. An ordinary human? Fair game! Another robot? Works just fine! \n\nAll I'm asking for is that you're literate and not a one-liner. I can use either Kik or Discord.\n\nThanks for reading my post! :D",

            "selftext": "Hello all. \n\nI've been super inspired by some of the posts here lately so I'd like to do something fantasy/modern based with a touch of time travel! I might be open to fantasy mixed with historical if you're so inclined. Generally I'm looking for something akin to the following:\n\n- Two people from a magical fantasy world travel to the modern world where there's hidden magic.\n\n- Two people from the modern world with n, travel to a medieval fantasy world. I might prefer this actually.\n\nI would be open one person coming to the new time and being accompanied by a local but I like the idea of two people experiencing the new world together. I'd be open to adding more characters though so we add more people to the cast. I can play women and men and am looking for something cute and fun with not much dark/angst themes involved. I would also like them to be able to go back and forth from the times freely, I don't want the RP taking place in just one time setting, I would like us to use both and develop a life in each one while dealing with fun little mysteries and quests, etc.\n\nGenerally I give 3 paragraphs. Mature content is okay with me in acceptable doses. Nothing excessive please. I can post several times a day, sometimes I may got a few days without posting though. So someone who is capable of varying speeds of posting is ideal. We have lives to live, am I right? \n\nLastly, I don't want to get too bogged down in the magic aspect. I've had people in the past want to build lore and it's dragged things down. So I'm not looking to dive too deeply into how things work unless it becomes a plot point. I think simple works best for the tone I'm going for but of course having some general idea of abilities, locations and stuff will still be necessary, I understand.\n\nIf you wanna get something going, shoot me a PM. I am also happy to take on a more GM sort of role if you'd like me to. Character appearances, I'd like anime pictures. Age range, 20s because that's around how old I am. And personality, someone who is cool with human interaction. No loner, jerk, bully, asocial characters please!",

I've been roleplaying for years and have plenty of ideas but this one is something I absolutely love. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The idea is that the world was struck by a asteroid which crippled the world, but at the same time it led to mana being discovered. After years the world used resources from the meteor to develop technology and build themselves back up. People with the ability to use their mana started going to schools to hone their powers and become powerful to compete in tournaments every year for prizes. The RP is about a country which is where five schools are at near a large city, My character and yours would be attending one. My character would play as a new student who comes to the school due to his family making him, he isn't much interested but knows he has to listen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   I can answer questions about it, smut can be involved but isn't a focal point of it.

Their father's were in the service together . they were both trained together by Charlie .\nOn a non- disclosed mission to assassinate a foreign dictator , they botched their mission . The supposed Illuminati sought revenge on the entire unit sent to snuff out his life by taking their children. Long story short Guile and Charlie managed to avoid this fate but Sophia along with three other children were captured and subjected to various physical and mental tortures and experimentation over the course of 5 years . Her father along with his comrades finally sought them out , but she was the only child to survive .\nTwisted from the experience showed telling signs of a sadistic personality in the year after , she was forced into boot camps until the age she could join the service herself to try and put focus and discipline as a secure structure to her life . seemingly working for several years until Guile , Charlie and herself were sent on a non- disclosed mission of their own . Something in her snapped and instead of helping the village rid of their enemies she started killing off the villagers men , women and children alike , seeing them as the real weakness in the situation .

I am a literate and experienced, mature-age roleplayer who has played across multiple platforms including chat, emails and even MMOs. My interests lie in both the small-scale character building and the large-scale worldbuilding that accompanies it.\n\nWhat I am looking for in a partner is somebody similar who has a similar approach to mine. I believe that two way communication is key to success in a RP relationship and that the players should not only engage with each other, but also feel free discuss and suggest plot, story and worldbuilding ideas.\n\nI am looking for something specific with regards to my character; I will be playing a MtF Trans character. What stage of their transition they are at is open to negotiation, but regardless they identify and present as female.\n\nI am interested in original worlds and settings based around Cyberpunk, Sci-Fi, Post-Apocalyptic and Low Fantasy genres. I have a few basic ideas I can work from for each of these, but I am also very much open to ideas and collaboratively building a world. I am only looking for one-to-one RP, not group games. I am not averse to including NSFW elements, but only as a part of the story, rather than for the simple sake of it.\n\nI prefer to play via email or Discord. If you are interested, please PM me. I will not reply to posts on this thread.",

            "selftext": "Hey lovely people!\n\nAfter finally watching the last episode of the season, I find myself really, *really* craving to RP in this universe again. I\u2019ve done some Destiel RPs in the past and while I adore that pairing, what I\u2019m really looking for at the moment is a (platonic/brotherly) RP that focuses on Dean\u2019s and Sam\u2019s relationship.\n\nI would love to play Dean and for my partner to play Sam. I'm also open to Dean/Castiel (either platonic or romantic), but it's not a must and as I said, what I'm really looking for right now is a gen RP with Dean and Sam. \n\nApart from that I would also be willing to play against/write other (side-)characters as well, if wanted (so e.g. if we want to include John, Bobby, Castiel or any of the other characters).  \n\nI would absolutely adore a Wee!chesters/Teen!chesters story, but I\u2019m also open to plots set in any season/canon setting or a complete AU.\n\nGenerally, I love Hurt&amp;Comfort/Angst, as long as things eventually end happily but I also adore fluff. I\u2019m happy with most themes, so I hope we\u2019ll be able to come up with something together. I love stories/RPs that focus on the characters and their thoughts/interactions with each other, but of course there needs to be a plot as well, or at least a general idea where things should go.\n\nI\u2019m comfortable with various forms of RPing, although I generally prefer either Tumblr, Discord or E-mail. Fair warning, I\u2019m not the fastest replier (I\u2019m also from Europe, just to give you an idea of possible time zone differences) and depending on the kind of scene we\u2019re doing, I do tend to write longer replies (anything from 300-1,500 max words I would say). I\u2019m a fairly experienced RPer (7+ years) and I\u2019m open to plotting and OOC chatter. \n\nAlso, I\u2019m practically always looking for new partners so even if you read this ad some time in the future and are  unsure whether you should contact me or not, just go ahead!\n\nThat is all for now. Thank you for reading and have a lovely day! :D",

Maybe there's a nuclear plant nearby where something more is going on than meets the eye? Yes, this sounds a lot like Dark and Stranger things and that's the point. I want to create our own little town with all of its residents and then build a great mystery around it all. I would also like to fill this town with characters of all genders and age and have them all be connected somehow. Obviously some characters would be more important than others but what I mean is that I want to make the world as vivid and real as possible and that requires multiple characters. So if you prefer to write only one character against another then you might want to skip this one! \n\n If you are over 21, open to all variaties of romance (m/m, f/m, f/f) and don't mind writing characters of different age groups then please do send me a pm! I have some ideas for the plot but I'd rather discuss those together with anyone who is interested. I'm looking for something dark so bear that in mind when contacting me! I do have a bad, dark sense of humor though and I certainly can appreciate that in my rps too so I'm not looking for something that's all gloom and doom.",

I'd like to play canon characters either right before, during, or right after the events of the books/series. Tbh, I prefer the books over the show, but I do believe the show has some elements we could use to craft something unique and interesting!\n\n**The main characters I'm looking to play are:** *Margaery Tyrell, Arya Stark, Sansa Stark, Robb Stark, Catelyn Tully/Stark, Cersei Lannister, Jaime Lannister, Jeyne Westerling, Taena Merryweather, and probably a bunch more as background characters.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for who you play, I'll be accepting just about anyone. The same goes for plot, though I do already have a few ideas when it comes to that! I'll be listing some of those below. I'll also just toss in the fact that I love serious plot/story lines, but am also a sucker for just *nsfw* stuff with good set-up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Here are just some plot bunnies I've been chasing for a while!**\n\n* *A Tyrell-Stark alliance formed by Robb and Margaery's marriage after Renly's death. Robb would basically be unstoppable with the might of Highgarden on his side.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* *Robb Stark doesn't attend/survives the Red Wedding. The term \"survive\" is tentative here, as he could be brought back in lieu of Lady Stoneheart and become \"The King with Ice for Blood.\" (If you can't tell, I have a lot of feelings about Robb and the RW  )*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* *Instead of going to the wall, Jon ends up accompanying Sansa and Arya to Kingslanding. Maybe he survives the attack on the Stark household and stays to protect Sansa. Maybe he ends up fleeing with Arya, at first being taken in by Yoren and then on their own after he dies.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* *Then there's also the option of Sansa taking Sandor up on his offer and leaving with him as the Blackwater burns.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Then we just have a multitude of stuff where people end up marrying different people woah buddy big changes ahoy. Again, those are just some plot bunnies I've been mulling over for a bit, but I'd also love to hear some of your ideas as well!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'll also be including a writing sample within this prompt to give you an idea of what I'm looking to do here writing-wise. Hope you enjoy enough to dm!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n&gt;!CATELYN!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe sun had been upon her for hours now but she felt to warmer for it. Her blood ran icy as the words rang in her head once more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*...and your son no less a traitor than my brother here. His day will come as well\u2026*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCatelyn looked to the sallow girl riding by her side. Brienne the Blue sunk low into her saddle, hunched and pallid. For all the great love the girl bore him she still could not keep Stannis\u2019 blade from Renly\u2019s neck. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe gods could be cruel and men crueler still. *And what is it I could do if Stannis sent his shadow to Riverrun this day,* Catelyn wondered bitterly. *I am a thousand leagues away but no safer would Robb be if I was five steps away.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCatelyn gripped her reins tight so that the leather was firm against her scars. How was a mother to protect against shadows in the night? Men with no forms and only ill intent to fuel them? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStannis\u2019 shadow was not the only thing she had to fear for, though. Stannis\u2019 growing host should concern her son as much as any shadow. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce the chaos had run its course Renly\u2019s vassals would soon fall into Stannis\u2019 command. Stannis would likely double his army in the coming days. Indeed, there were a great many reasons to fear Stannis. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSer Wendel Manderly then came up beside her. \u201cA scout has returned from Storm\u2019s End. He brings news of the Highgarden host.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*What news could they bring that I do not already know?* \u201cPray, what is it they say?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSer Manderly continues. \u201cHe reports that while a good many of Renly\u2019s lords have joined Stannis, it would appear that the Reach has pulled out of the fray. Much of Highgarden\u2019s host has already left for Bitterbridge.\u201d He then pauses for a moment as if to let his words wash over. \u201cAs you are like to know, though, much dissent remains among the ranks. It is said that Ser Loras Tyrell alone has already slain three of the Rainbow Guard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cI\u2019d advise that we stay our course through the Riverlands. Bitterbridge will be heavy with men who are like as not to capture us, my lady. Let us make for the Freys or the Blackfish\u2019s encampment.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCatelyn considered carefully for a moment, her mouth twisting with words she was sure Ser Manderly would not wish to hear. News of Renly\u2019s death would spread quickly, and with that, so would news of Highgarden\u2019s disengagement. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith a sigh, she speaks. \u201cYour counsel is sound, Ser Manderly,\u201d *...and your son no less a traitor than my brother here... \u201c*but I believe Bitterbridge is our only means to forge an alliance with Highgarden,\u201d ...*His day will come as well... \u201c*I have already failed my son in securing an alliance with Renly, gods be good, do not let me fail him in this as well.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSer Manderly looked carefully at her. He shook his head once and then twice before looking at her again. \u201cThen so let it be,\u201d he finally said, \u201cI will tell the men.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d rushed to her lips, hurried and almost pleading. \u201cPlease, what you say of Bitterbridge is like to be true. I\u2019d be loath to lose any of my son\u2019s men to capture. He needs his strength. Give me leave to go alone, or with numbers greatly decreased. Let the others return to Riverrun.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBrienne the Blue then said, \u201cAllow me to accompany you, Lady Catelyn. You have done me a kindness, let me repay you.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCatelyn rounded her eyes at Brienne. The girl was more like to get herself killed than protect her if she was to accompany her. If it was not the Tyrell\u2019s men it would Stannis that would cut her down. Catelyn wished not to see it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cYou are sweet to say so,\u201d Catelyn replied, \u201cbut I fear for your safety in Bitterbridge. Please, accompany my son\u2019s men to Riverrun. No harm shall come to you there.\u201d Catelyn felt almost responsible for this young, rash girl now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cIt is decided then. Though it is my terms that I shall be one of your guards,\u201d said Ser Manderly. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cAye, and I as well, my lady,\u201d interjected Hallis Mollen. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA small smile tugged at her lips. \u201cThen I shall be well protected, won\u2019t I?\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**------**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey were sighted almost immediately upon setting foot in the Reach. It took precious little time for a suitable escort to be arranged. Catelyn was tired of this game, of men playing at war while real war raged all around them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCatelyn had written a letter to Robb the day she departed for Bitterbridge. She wondered if he had held it in his hands as of yet. How would he look upon her words? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt had been short and ill-made, her writing little better than scrawl. But her meaning could be discerned well enough, she was confident. She informed him of Renly\u2019s assassination, as well as of Highgarden\u2019s departure. She even wrote him of her intentions to treat with Mace Tyrell. She, however, did not mention that she was intending on offering Robb\u2019s hand to Margaery Tyrell. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe had struck a deal much the same with Walder Frey and his brood. But the Twins were nothing in comparison to Highgarden. There was little contest. Still, Catelyn knew her son\u2019s way. His honor would be marred if he broke his word with Walder Frey, but Catelyn saw no other way. Surely, when the time comes, her son would see. And Margaery Tyrell was a fine enough girl besides. He should have no qualms once all was set in stone. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy the time Catelyn arrived at Bitterbridge, a good portion of the Tyrell had already turned for Highgarden, taking Margaery Tyrell with them. Perhaps that was for the better. Catelyn did not know whether the girl bore any tender feelings for her late husband.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMace Tyrell had remained with his host and his son in Bitterbridge. Ser Loras Tyrell, as beautiful as he was brash, made no attempts at hiding his contempt. For all his pettish recklessness, he did favor his sister. It was an almost striking comparison to make, especially in the low light.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Renly made careful considerations in choosing a bride I see,* though Catelyn once while she sat across from Mace with Loras\u2019 looming like a shadow behind. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUpon first undertaking the task of allying Stark and Tyrell, Catelyn had thought her task a laborious thing to realize. She was surprised to find, though, that Mace Tyrell was entirely receptive to her proposal. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course, Catelyn didn\u2019t begin with the discussion of marriage. It was a slow progression that gave Mace Tyrell time and reason enough to conclude the conversation with the topic of a Tyrell-Stark marriage. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMace Tyrell was an easy enough man to convince of this. His mother, the Queen of Thorns Catelyn had once heard her called, governed his life and his dealings to a degree Catelyn had not yet observed. Robb, young as he was, didn\u2019t allow himself to be bullied into decisions, even by his own mother. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAllowing Mace to believe this alliance was of his own invention gave him something to tide himself on. Loras remained unmoved, however. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was a humid night when Catelyn came upon Mace\u2019s tent only to hear him and his son locked in bitter argument. She stayed long enough to hear the contents but departed before discovery. It took her a night\u2019s sleep to unravel the meaning of the words she had heard through the green canvas. Eventually, she came upon it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLoras, during his journey to Bitterbridge, had been won over by the small council. Instead of the Young Wolf, Loras wished for his sister to marry yet another False Stag. There was little to trust in the impetuous boy before, but now there was nothing. The Knight of Flowers who played at war and alliances would not weather the winter. Catelyn only hoped his sister would fare better than he. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**------**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEventually, it was generally understood that Catelyn would follow Mace to Highgarden to deliberate further and more seriously on the matter of Robb and Margaery\u2019s marriage. In all this time, though, Catelyn had yet to send Robb a single letter detailing her dealings with the Tyrells. She hoped, that mayhaps, if he could only see Highgarden and its vast host as well as his pretty young bride, he would agree. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe penned him a letter the day before she was due to depart with Mace. Loras, much to Catelyn\u2019s immense relief, was to stay in Bitterbridge with a score of knights. *Perhaps one of his father\u2019s flower knights could fill the hole Renly left,* Catelyn once thought sourly. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*My dearest son,* she began. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Though my place is by your side, I am content to continue your work here in the Reach. I have managed to secure an alliance with Lord Tyrell of Highgarden. He wishes to see his daughter wed to you, the King in the North. You will find her to be a fair and dutiful maid, as her marriage to Renly was unconsummated as said by her lord father. I know you find your honor to be in your word, but I beseech you, my eldest son, my king, to set aside your previously decided marriage. With this alliance, you shall have all the power of Highgarden behind you.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Still, if this sits unwell with you, I urge you to ride to Highgarden and discuss your own terms with Lord Mace Tyrell of Highgarden. I am sure you are to move him if you set yourself to the task. I shall be accompanying Lord Tyrell to Highgarden.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Be wary of the Lannisters and of the small council, my son. They have already sought to turn the Tyrells to their advantage. If you do not secure this alliance, the Lannisters certainly will.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*I ask that you not write in return, only make haste to Highgarden. I shall be there to greet you my son.* \n\n*I can now only count the days until I may hold your face in my hands my sweetest Robb.* \n\n*Truly*\n\n*Your Lady Mother*\n\n*Catelyn Stark*",

This will be set in the future, yet with a dazzle of historical stuff like old fashioned weapons and government. If interested kik ZoePrescottXxX (my new kik)",

I\u2019m a 21 year old female looking for anyone 19-27 that can play a male character whether you\u2019re actually male, female, non-binary, etc. it doesn\u2019t matter to me what you are in real life. All my plots are safe for work. I do NOT write smut. My roleplays typically focus on drama and romance with a hint of action depending on the role. I am pretty much advanced lit. Writing anywhere from a couple to multiple paragraphs. I also only write in third person. Please be creative. All \u2018hi\u2019s and \u2018hey\u2019s will be ignored. Here\u2019s a whole list of roleplays I currently do:\n\n*The Fighter* a story about a boxer/MMA fighter and his girlfriend, who doesn\u2019t approve of his profession at all. This can be altered to any contact sport and not just fighting , for example bull riding. \n\n*The Wolves* Many years ago a young girl was attacked by a pack of wolves in a place where wolves aren\u2019t common. A twist on your cliche werewolf story.\n\n*The Contract* the two top young rising celebrities don\u2019t get along at all, for various reasons. What happens when their managers go behind their backs and set the two up on a date? Forcing them to sign a six month contract , claiming to be a couple in the public eye. \n\n*The Vlog* Our characters are both vloggers and split up long ago. But what happens when they meet at a convention again? What does (Y/C) do when he finds out that (m/c)\u2019s new boyfriend is planning to propose to her? She doesn\u2019t know, but it\u2019s been told to him. How will the two handle running into each other days before everything could change?\n\n*Faking It* A young girl is making her way through life by stripping at a high end club for business men. She has a regular visitor that spends much more on her in an hour than most do the entire night. She practically only comes into work for him. But what happens when he\u2019s told he can only further his career in his family\u2019s company by settling down? He\u2019s been lying about having a girlfriend for years...\n\n*The Selection* A slight futuristic twist on your modern day Bachelor/Bachelorette reality tv show. Involves royals, rebels and so much more.\n\n*Fandoms* we can discuss Game of Thrones, Avatar the Last Airbender, Star Wars, and Harry Potter",

That was until the local high school sent busloads of their students off for an extended camping trip. That is until a storm forced the students to return home. But upon their return they soon realize that all of the town's adults have vanished. Their newfound freedom is fun and exciting for the group at first, but it quickly becomes dangerous. Now they are faced with responsibility they weren't ready for. While they struggle to figure out what has happened to them, and how to get their town back to normal, the teens have to establish some sort of order and form alliances to survive. But that's not the only thing they have to worry about. They still have to figure out how they got here, and why this place looks exactly like home but without the parents.. And soon enough they will realize there is a lot more that is different to this place and a lot more they have to worry about.\n\nhttps://discord.gg/YwyJ5Tw\n\nWe are using all our own OCs.

With this RP I will explain the plot in DM, and we can work out an app to do it on!

Basically like hitting enter 4 to 7 times.\n\n3: Don't be one of those people who do this: *he looks around and spots nothing* hm now what\n\nThat's annoying. \n\n4: With this RP, I need someone who knows Pyra/Mythra's personalities from the game. \n\nI hope to see someone soon!

For this we can discuss ideas, I\u2019ll really try anything.\n\n  \u26acSemi-literate to literate depending on the plot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What I\u2019m looking for :**\n\n  \u26acLong-term roleplay partner\n\n  \u26acSomeone to share a lot of interests with me so we can make many great stories\n\n  \u26acSomeone that doesn\u2019t mind occasional spelling or grammar errors cause I\u2019m not perfect.

            "selftext": "Back at my clownery and wanting to do some low fantasy Renaissance-esque stuff. Basically something along the lines of A Plague Tale where plague-ridden, man-eating rats are wreaking havoc all over the continent.\n\nMost of the world-building stuff will be in the prompt, though feel free to ask me questions or work with me to tweak some things! I absolutely love plotting and building unique fantasy worlds and I'd love to hear some of your ideas too!\n\nThe gist of it is that while the brunt of the black plague (commonly referred to in this world as \"The Great Pestilence\") has already passed, it pops up every few years, normally during winter. While the infected rats can be ravenous, they dare not tread where the light touches. The rats fear any sort of light and can be killed with fire. Otherwise, you're pretty much outta luck when it comes to *these* plague rats.\n\nI'll be playing a young noblewoman by the name of Caterina ni Regine. Her family lineage can be traced back to kings and queens of old. While once rich and powerful, the continued pestilence has brought the Regines to a very low condition.\n\nThis would be Caterina: [https://i.imgur.com/62drdvi.png](https://i.imgur.com/62drdvi.png)\n\nCaterina is to leave her country estate and travel to the Republic of Firenze, where she will marry for the good of her family. Firenze itself is a great, walled city known for its commerce and culture. During the harsh winters when the Great Pestilence rears its ugly head, Firenze is known to shelter a great number of fleeing peasants behind its walls.\n\nSafety often comes at a cost, though, and many peasants become servants in one of the great houses to pay their way. Others smuggle themselves in via Firenze's numerous underground tunnels and sewers. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's a whole lot more stuff, but that's just the basics! More stuff will be in the prompt and we can discuss everything else!\n\nAs for your character, though, you can play almost anyone. The person Caterina's to marry, a servant in her new household, a peasant or even a smuggler. There's a lot of options and I'd love to explore them all!\n\nI like a lot of worldbuilding as well as plot, though I do have a soft spot for *mature* themes with good set-up!\n\nI'll also just mention that I've never really used this format/subreddit before, so bear with me if I something seems off. I will say that I have been roleplaying (primarily paragraph) for a few years now so I'm not a total newbie!\n\nWell without further ado, here's my prompt!\n\n(PS the language might be a bit too ye olde englishy, so just tell me to cool it with it if that bothers you!)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\---------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe carriage rocked and jolted over stony ground, every bump causing her to lurch forward against the gilded pane. The emblem she wore tight around her neck tapped against the painted wood. Noli's rolling hills passed her window in a slow, laborious procession.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Do you think this winter come will be as fair as the last?\" Constanza asked idly, her eyes as prone to wander as her thoughts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThough it had been the Sun-Matron Gilda Constanza had meant to ask, Caterina supplied her own answer before the Matron could even part her shriveled lips.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"No,\" Caterina said, still glaring out her unshuttered window. \"There will never again be another fair winter. The winter will be long and the days short, and the rats will have eaten of your flesh before the end of it.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMatron Gilda croaked in distaste, flattening her lips into a bitter line that made her look even more froggish than usual. Caterina had once divulged to Constanza that the reason for Matron Gilda's appearance was that she had once eaten the slimy legs of a frog while in Firenze. Caterina wondered if her sister still remembered.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"A Lady oughtn't converse so coarsely with her own blood. You'd had best apologize and pray on it at the twilight.\" Caterina felt Matron Gilda's righteous gaze boring into her back, but she did not care. She had not cared for ten or so days now. Not since she had found her seat in this wretched carriage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nConstanza waved off the offense much like she did anything. \"Oh, she has only taken ill of herself because of her marriage. I'd be rather ill too if father had pressed me to marry a rat-catcher.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCaterina stayed quiet. She did not so much as breathe with force. *I do not mind that bit,* she thought to herself. No, it was something else that hung heavy on her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"One oughtn't profane those who work in the honor of the Lord, either,\" spoke the Sun-Matron Gilda again, her ire now directed at Constanza though both sisters seemed equally deaf to her now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey arrived at the First Gate an hour after the sun had reached its peak. A great swell of people surrounded the gate. Their Matron instructed the girls to shutter their windows before they met the mob.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven so, the stench still permeated the carriage. Constanza kept her kerchief firmly over her nose, threatening to swoon. Caterina moved closer to Matron Gilda, leaning into the Matron's snug embrace.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Wherefore are they here? And in such numbers besides,\" asked Constanza, muffled under her kerchief.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCaterina looked to her Matron, wondering just the same. The First Gate wasn't meant for appealing. It was for the *speaking-class;* the peerage and common society. Peasants made their appeals for entry at the back gates, away from where the gentry had to look at them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer Matron brushed back Caterina's black curls with her thumb. \"This coming winter shan't be fair. Those that must bear it alone now wish to shelter the winter at Firenze.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*The pestilence is like enough to renew itself and the frost take what's left, just as father had said,* thought Caterina. She had heard her father speaking with the magister over it. She wondered if her father could weather another harsh winter. The gout had wizened him beyond his age, cutting lines into his face and a curve into his back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPeeking out through her shutters, Caterina committed the mob to memory. Sun-Matron Gilda had once told her that the smallfolk of Firenze were encouraged by their betters to speak only in hushed tones or not at all so not to lure the scourge to the city. The horde around them created such a cacophonous sound that Caterina could scarcely believe they ever meant to quiet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe gilded gates glinted with summer sun and the carriage was soon beyond them, away from the loud voices and rank stench of the crowd. Caterina couldn't help but to catch a final glimpse of them as the gates batted back together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*The summer is renewed but a fortnight and yet...*",

This roleplay will be a timeskip roleplay either set several years into the future after Class 1-A have all been pros for years OR a timeskip to just after they graduated from U.A. high.  \n\n\nI'm a massive My Hero Academia fan so I'll be playing a ton of characters! Here are my rules/notes for the RP:\n\n* If you plan on playing a canon character, I require you to be caught up to the manga! If you are playing an OC, this is unnecessary.\n* Due to the nature of the RP, spoilers will be included from time to time!\n* I do NOT mind you playing a character (specifically an OC) with a strong quirk. But you have to be smart about it. Are they making bad use of their strong quirk? Are they MASTERS of their quirk? Give me some drawbacks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay that's all I can think of for that part. Now to what I am looking for in a partner:\n\n* 18+ in age! Dark themes can and will occur in this roleplay. Happens all the time in the anime/manga!\n* Literate.\n* Minimum one paragraph per response. The more the merrier!\n* 2-3 responses per day. Same thing goes here, even more and I'll be a happy roleplayer! I understand life gets in the way so if you can't meet the requirement don't worry! I'll understand.  \n\n\nThat's just about everything! If you're interested please send my a DM and we'll flesh things out from there :\\^)",

            "selftext": "  \n\nI responded to a writing prompt on r/WritingPrompts and it became a roleplay idea. A bit of modern slice of life. This is the full response I wrote after I submitted my response to the prompt on that subreddit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*The buzzing of the phone stirred the man from a short slumber. As he groaned and tossed the sheet back and forth, a small tantrum, defying the nature of the organized life and society. Grunting the man who could be called middle-aged sat up, loud pops and cracks wracking him with pain and misery. The discomfort was due to numerous reasons, but the most likely culprit was the impossibly soft and overused mattress that had been in the man\u2019s possession since he opened his coffee shop and lived in the loft above it. It had been a dream of his since he was but a man refusing to comply with conforming with the college grind. Opening an artesian coffee shop and spreading the name of his delicately refined roasts across the land.* \n\n*Dreams never come true. That\u2019s what the man learned.* \n\n*But still, he lived a comfortable albeit meager living, and he owed nothing to anyone. Debts were paid, the building was paid for, and he was his own man. He focused on combining grounds and focused on his craft and although his building and abode was dated horribly and in need of renovation, it had established itself as one of the best hole-in-the-wall coffee shops in all of the land. As word spread, people would come, and most would wait several minutes for a single cup of decadent dark roast that would fuel the soul and for many people would be their one indulgence for the day.* \n\n*Climbing down the stairs to his shop, the clock on the wall read four fifteen in the morning. Ritual had become the man\u2019s norm as he cleaned the shop up and prepared the dining room for his customers. He served no food in this establishment. This was no bakery, and this was not a place people could come to plug in and disconnect from the day. There was no Wi-Fi, and no matter the pleas the man would not modernize the store. If one wanted that atmosphere, they could go to one of those chains that actually makes money.* \n\n*As the man proceeded to set up his coffee makers one of his oldest customers had come in. This woman had been a customer since he opened up shop all those decades ago. While seeing these people day in and day out, he tried to stay out of their personal lives, going so far as to not learn the names of most of the people that had come in. This woman was different though, she had an elegance about her. Although the man could not be sure, she didn\u2019t seem to age a day since he first noticed her. A wild mane of blonde curly locks that served as a halo surrounding the creamy brown skin and piercing blue eyes. Truly a statuesque and regal looking woman, a woman that would turn heads in any event. She typically was the first customer of the day, and over the years she had worked her way into this man\u2019s life.*\n\n*\u201cGood morning!\u201d She inhaled deeply revealing a pleasured smiled on her face as she took in the aroma of all the coffees being made for the morning rush. \u201c\u2026 I will never get over that aroma\u2026\u201d*\n\n*\u201cGood morning Miss Twilight.\u201d The man never felt right calling her by her first name. That level of familiarity was not something he was used to, especially with someone so beautiful. He never learned the profession of Miss Twilight, but she was obviously successful and did well enough for herself. \u201cShall I get you the usual?\u201d*\n\n*The woman stood for a moment and pondered the man before raising her hand to snap her fingers. In a moment the sound of trickling coffee pouring into pots ceased. As the man looked back and forth he noticed everything around him slowed to a standstill. Blinking, not sure if he was dreaming, the man questioned the scene surrounding him. As he moved to investigate the paranormal experience the woman began. \u201cI must admit, seeing you collect more gray hairs troubles me.\u201d*\n\n*The woman strode with confidence. Sitting on one of only three stools laying one leg over the other pulling down her skirt to keep herself modest she proceeded to lean forward on the counter to continue her proposal to the man who had served her all these years. \u201cYou needn\u2019t worry about other customers currently, I have ceased the river of time to have this private audience with you. I have certain\u2026 abilities.\u201d*\n\n*The man stood and waited for further elaboration. As he did so he couldn\u2019t help but feel the uncomfortable sensation of admiration coming from this beautiful woman. He never was the type of man who could speak to women well. His paunch belly, speckled face, and large hooked nose had surely made him feel less than desirable. After a while, the yearning for attention and desire seemed to quiet, and it became something he simply used to do. To have those feelings stir again were strange, unsettling and he wasn\u2019t sure if he approved of it.* \n\n*\u201cI have a proposal for you my good sir. You shall serve me coffee for all of eternity. You will wake up in the loft above here every morning much like you do now. You will not age another day, and you will not tire, grow older or sick. You will serve me as you have served me for the past nineteen years three hundred and twenty-one days.\u201d The man still didn\u2019t understand what Miss Twilight was talking about, what she was referring to. But considering the coffee pots were no longer filling he felt useless as he could not dispense upon her what she always came in to enjoy.* \n\n*\u201c\u2026So, something different today it seems. Not your usual?\u201d*\n\n*The woman sighed, knowing full well the man couldn\u2019t grasp the gravity of the situation. It was all over his face. The pale skin from lack of sunlight. The constant red eyes due to dryness. The scars from acne on his face and the nervousness in his voice. Miss Twilight very much appreciated the man and his routines as it synchronized well with her daily responsibilities. But this man could not grasp the bigger picture. He couldn\u2019t grasp the service she would be doing for his goddess. She would ask again in a few years, maybe after the daily grind would finally start to break down the man\u2019s psyche. Maybe she could then seek the comforts of a man solely dedicated to a singular task, and perhaps she could learn more about this man.*\n\n*Grabbing the man by the collar of his shirt and pulling him in, she planted a deep kiss on his lips. The process to wipe the man\u2019s memories of the most recent events. And as she let go of the artisan the coffee pots continued to brew the coffee as she patiently awaited her usual.*\n\n*As Miss Twilight watched the man pour her Jamaican Blue Mountain Blend, she admired him. She took it black not wanting anything interfering with the rich taste. The pungent aroma, the scent took her back to the beginning of civilization. The start of mortals truly creating something unique. Being driven by the most basic needs to create and to rise above the goddess admired the tenacity of the human spirit. Then she looked back at the aging and breaking middle-aged man in front of her. At one point he was young and vibrant. Probably more so than he cared to admit. While he never would appeal to many in terms of attractiveness. What Miss Twilight saw in him stirred something she simply couldn\u2019t let go of. As the man turned the handles of the coffee pots and moved several pots to warming areas he whirled about delivering her usual in front of her atop a bill for goods and services rendered.*\n\n*She sipped the coffee as she watched the man work. He was not in shape, nor was he obese. His shirt stretched across his arms as they neatly bulged out of the short sleeves. As coarse hair trailed up his arms and popped out of his neck collar, slightly unkempt but not in a matter that would trifle the goddess. She saw potential in the man who never opened himself up to anyone. She sipped the coffee letting out a subtle moan as the searing liquid coated her throat. The rich velvety texture of the liquid hugged her esophagus and brought pleasure to the goddess as she enjoyed the diligence of the man and enjoyed watching him work. Not in many centuries has she come across a mortal so dedicated to an art. To the point where he neglected nearly every other human desire. She had never seen the man with another, and she had been watching. The man\u2019s routine was easy to follow. Every morning without fail, the man would wake up at a quarter past four in the morning. Having showered the night before, he would descend the stairs and carefully arrange his blends in order to make the most efficient use of time. As he brewed coffee, he dumped out old pots, some of which may have only had a single cup depleted from the supply. The man never served old coffee, striving to keep everything fresh. It was a symphony of motion watching the man twirl and move. It was a dance the man had perfected over the years, and it brought joy to Miss Twilight.*\n\n*A goddess like herself had little in terms of pure enjoyment in her life. As she started her morning she walked eagerly to the store on the corner that started to show its datedness. She admired the perseverance of the spirit of the building. Sensing the aura of it, and sensing that it housed something truly special. Not that the proprietor was aware of his nature as the nucleus of the life of a goddess. As the proprietor finally rested after ensuring all of his most popular blends were made he pulled the rag from his apron and wiped the counter finally noticing Miss Twilight\u2019s eyes upon him. \u201cEnjoying the coffee?\u201d*\n\n*A rosy hue came to the goddess\u2019s cheeks as she nodded. She sipped again and looked down sheepishly. She knew why she found the proprietor so fascinating but also knew she made the man feel uncomfortable being forward. She had tried for many years to build up the man in order for him to approach her, but to no avail. She twirled the coffee in front of her as it reflected the singular light in the small coffee shop. Sighing she looked up at the man as she pried for the trade secret yet again. \u201cYou simply must tell me what you do to make your coffee so unique\u2026\u201d*\n\n*\u201cTrade secret, Miss Twilight. You know that\u2026 I tell you that nearly every day.\u201d The retort came with more of a grumble than anything.* \n\n*\u201cYeah, I know\u2026 but someday I will wear you down and you will show me.\u201d*\n\n*The proprietor chuckled and shook his head. It was unlikely he would divulge his trade secrets to the woman, as she was just a customer, albeit a very loyal customer. The man had a thousand questions to ask Miss Twilight, but not a speck of courage to do so. He continued to wipe the counter as the bell above the door rang signaling another customer coming into the tiny shop on the corner. As the proprietor waved to the customer he noticed it was someone he had not recognized before. Perhaps it was someone who had been in his shop only a few times, but the face seemed to escape recognition.*\n\n*\u201cWelcome, have a seat.\u201d*\n\n*The new customer was not interested in coffee, or pleasantries. As he pulled out a nine-millimeter hand gun from his coat pocket and fired a single shot at the proprietor. The casing fell from the chamber as the round was propelled forward from the barrel of the gun. Miss Twilight could not comprehend why anyone would want to harm someone so purely devoted to their work, but she could intervene and stop it, keep the man she was pining for safe from harm. She pondered what her existence would be like if she followed the decree of the Gods and stayed out of conflicts of man. As the bullet slipped by she had moments to react, and even after the bullet sunk into the forehead of the proprietor of the small coffee shop she could easily reverse the river of time to save the man. A dilemma arose in the goddess\u2019s mind as she considered the very real possibility of not having the man who made the most delicious coffee she had ever had in her existence\u2026*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat I want:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot necessarily to continue this story line, but a modern world where Gods and Goddesses exist and interact with humanity, fall in love and see the beauty in their struggles. I want to write a world where a man falls for a woman who is an exceptional beauty, and has exceptional abilities. I want to write with someone, and be inspired to think about story lines and plot arcs. I want someone who is a nerd for this as much as I am. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIts not often I love what I write, but I truly love the bit I have provided above. Thank you for your time in reading this, and I look forward to hearing from you.",

I roleplay in 3rd person, write semi-longish paragraphs and I'm trying my best to be litterate since English is not my native language, I make mistakes here and there. I like to talk about the direction of the storyline and our characters. \nThe settings is a modern day in which fantasy creatures are not known of. My character is a vampire who is a book shop owner. The roleplay would be male on male. I would lije for our characters to eventually, but slowly, fall in love with each other so they could even have fun at bed.

Lately, I\u2019ve been in a super-hero mood, and decided to post this. \n\nThough, this post is diving into Akira Toriyama\u2018s world of *Dragon Ball*. The world of ki, and seven magical orbs that summon a mythical dragon to grant a wsih.\n\nIdeally, I wish to focus on the characters of, *Son Gohan* and *Videl Satan,* but more so their secret identities: Saiyaman and Saiyawoman.\n\nOf course, if we want to start things out with just Gohan being a hero, and work towards Videl suiting up, also fiine. Part of me enjoys the Saiyaman Arc, in the Buu Saga, with Gohan attempting to have a more noraml life, compared to the previous Arcs.  Perhaps we can write this as an AU, where Buu never appears, and Gohan focuses more on School and Hero work; this might invovle some OC villain creations along the line.\n\nOr, if we would want to start, with both suited up, and working a hero team, that\u2019s fine too.\n\nPerhaps taking a page from Either Xenoverse with some, *timey wimey fun,* having the two Saiya-warriors deal with the likes of the Ginyu force, or other beings who might challenge the two and their poses  throughout time.The aspect I really love about the Saiyaman persona, is the call back to Sentai and things of that nature. over the top poses, displaying a sense of Justice, a righteous attitude.\n\nAll things I\u2019d like to include, but with the fun Dragon Ball elemtns too: flying, powering up, dealing with huge creatures similar to Kaju. Though, I will say I like the idea of spinning off in an AU, from the Buu Saga more, than starting with them already as their personas.\n\nOpen to writing as either, Gohan or Videl; doubling and background characters too!\n\nThis fully up to discussion, so if you are interested, let\u2019s start brainstorming!\n\nA quick few things about myself:\n\n* I live in EST, and have a part time job.\n* I aim for at least a decent post a day, though I am aware of life and things come up.\n* I prefer to write in third person, and past tense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNO REDDIT CHAT PLEASE. If you would like to discuss, PM is the way to go.",

            "selftext": "Hello, \n\nI'm looking for a roleplay partner for a roleplay based around a seemingly emotionally stunted detective (I don't have something like the BBC series Sherlock in mind, not that seemingly cold) \n\nThe detective is a mystery to the public, a few years ago, while still a teenager, they managed to help crack a case that the police were at dead ends for, the police just humoured them but the suggestion was solid. After completing their schooling, they're practically the public face for the local police, while rather cold and calculating, they seem good to entertain a crowd and with a local celebrity status, they are more relaxing to the public than a regular officer.\n\nLooking wise, they will almost be the same male or female, typically wearing button up shirts and slim trousers (as well as a binder if they are a woman). They're short at 5'2\", have a pretty slim figure, a very neutral face and they have brown hair that reaches their shoulders but they typically wear some kind of had. Their voice is a bit deep and gruff but also has softness to it.\n\nThe roleplay can be about anything and as long as we can both keep up with each other, I'm happy with short replies but more than a couple of paragraphs a reply is a lot for me but I'll likely match your length in replies the best I can. I don't mind replies of a few words but constraint 5 word replies will quickly become a drag . \n\nGenres I have in mind (I don't mind others being suggested): Thriller, romance (any/any), action, adventure \n\nI am happy to rp with anyone of any age. I am also happy to get NSFW as long as you are over 18 (I am) and it doesn't just become bedroom play forever, that gets boring. \n\nOf course you're free to pick the detective's gender, there's not going to be some shocking 'They're trans' revelation with them either way\n\nI am happy to roleplay though PMs, Kik and Discord. \n\nI do have a starting idea, if you have your own then you can stop reading here. \n\nIt was a shocking turn of events for the police, a couple of rival gangs suddenly broke out into a war, clashing mostly in back alleys but there were still fights and there were still murders. The main issue for the police is that the gangs suddenly appeared from nowhere, with the police not even knowing who they were after, they called the person known as the \"ice face detective\" as they were the face of the force and could give poker players a run for their money with how little they reacted, even to things that would make an officer throw up. \n\nThe only issue with this for you is that you keep running into the detective! Eventually you're taken in for questioning but quickly released, clearly you were either a big fan or need to stop going into back alleys. Given that you were taken in suddenly with nothing to do with anything, the detective escorts you out of the station before saying something likely unexpected, \"Would you like me to escort you to your destination? I wouldn't have liked to have ruined your day over a bad hunch\"",

            "selftext": "*It was the first day of the last summer break before the Exam year at university. We are good friends living together in a house just of campus. It had a nice front and back yard complete with a tree house from the previous occupants. We decided to not get rid of it and just convert it to a game house with some insulation and gaming consoles. We would often fall asleep inside it while we were chilling and this was the case we found ourselves in. Passed out between chips and beer while the PS4PRO put itself into sleep mode.*\n\n*The birds were chirping outside on the branches of the tree as per usual but the sound was different. more complicated. like human singing. Normally they served as our natural alarm clock but now they were just a nuisance since we didn't need to go anywhere or wake up. I woke up first to shut them up but before i could scare them away i noticed something was off... I walked towards the entrance of the wooden structure and thought to myself. \"Why is everything so big?\" as everything seemed so high up as well even though i was sure i was standing normally. Even the planks that made up the hut looked way bigger for some reason. Not to mention the distance to the door seemingly quadrupled. I entered the seemingly massive dark oak door which we left open. \"We are lucky it didn't rain.\" i thought to myself again. It happened a few times already and a few consoles kicked the bucket because of it. like our old x box. We had a new flower pot to prove it. I push the large dark oak door which was the entrance to our treehouse open further and yell \"SHUT UP!\" to the strange looking birds. the were very large They flew away immediately with a trail of light following behind them.*\n\n*I instantly covered my mouth. my voice it was so high. Like the voice of a child. This shock made me wake up completely and get my eyes to open. There was something in my view where i should see the ground and my nose. It was long blue and scaly. It was a muzzle. a reptiles muzzle! The shock makes me recoil into you. though it was not my legs or my behind that hit you first. it was something else. Something that i could feel. that was very flexible. A tail maybe? i look back and i open my mouth in shock. THERE WAS A REPTILE TAIL ON ME! this was insane, and it didn't stop there. As i look further up my body i see no human feature on me. There was no skin just scales and two small mounds out of which two large wings came out.*\n\n*I turn to you and start to shake you awake. I push and pull with with all my might but I was to light to effectively shake you awake though. even with all my weight put into it all i could manage was a gentle shake for your head and most upper body \"WAKE UP!\" I yell terrified with the voice of a small child.*\n\n*My fear fear blinded me though. i could not see if you were transformed or not. I just saw a human figure. Maybe you were turned to muscled warrior, a powerful wizard, A holy knight or maybe a stealthy rogue. maybe your entire species changed as well. Going to a elf, orc, dragonborn or maybe even a demon with horns and all..*\n\n**---End of super duper not at all messy or bad prompt from a very good writer.--- (As if.)**\n\nHello thank you for reading my (probably bad and messy) prompt. For this RP i want to explore two ordinary college students that suddenly get sucked into a high fantasy world of magic and dragons. Unfortunately one of the two turned into a blue baby ice dragon. that one would still keep his/her mind but be it would be about as smart as a high school student. Reflexes and instincts would change as well. For example Instead of punching to fight back it would spew forth a icy beam to freeze the attacker. Instead of a omnivore it would be a carnivore. So veggies would be of the table and be replaced with larger animals or insects or insects. Of course all of this and more can be discussed Including if you or i am the dragon. Though i would prefer to be the small reptilian.\n\nThis would mainly be a character driven roleplay and how they explore this bizarre situation and the new world they land in.  \nI would like it if we had this roleplay on discord. I just like that platform the most. Though a reddit chat or DM is fine with me. Please do note. I am in GMT+1 (Amsterdam time) And at the time of writing it is 15:01/3:01 PM. So please keep that in mind. And for your first message. Make sure you include you include the phrase 'my favourite food is \\[insert food here\\]\". Otherwise i won't respond.\n\nI hope to hear from you soon. (Either way. you are all still awesome)",

            "selftext": "I've spent several hundreds of hours thinking of cool scenes in my head, fantastical battles and locations and colorful characters and nations without ever actually bothering to put them down to paper or properly constructing them and their relationships to one another. I like making up universes with naturally occurring resources and materials that ultimately decide where civilizations sprout and the cultures they develop thanks to what they have on hand, whether they drape themselves in colorful dyes and fabrics, if the nobility serve as the classical warrior caste of tyrants who wage war as a sport and pastime - or something unique and alien that we couldn't produce ourselves due to a lack of access to magic.\n\nIf you PM me, don't suspect to see the usual borderline plagiarism of Tolkien. Yes, there will be non-human races. No, they will not be humans except quirky. Their psychologies and the way they come to conclusions on topics will be completely different from yours or mine as, like their appearance, they've evolved completely differently from the human species.\n\nMagic will be borderline nonexistent with the vast majority of spellcasters serving as the hands to dukes, kings and queens and emperors thanks to the insight they give into the unseen world; your character will be not capable of the magic-making. Monsters will be highly prevalent and act as an existential threat to the world people knows, attacking villages, disrupting production, generally making life more miserable for people than actual Medieval society was already.\n\nThat being said. This is a Low Middle Ages universe in terms of technology. Expect it to be largely unpleasant. It is a is a world where production cannot provide for the majority of people and stratification of society leaves little to the common person to make use of; poverty amongst the urban-dwelling peasantry will be common whilst the rural folks live sustainable albeit unexciting and dreary lives. The vast majority of nobility live dull, but comfortable lives compared to the majority of the population.\n\nKings and queens are expected to be pious, gregarious, and utterly ruthless monsters for the sake of the status quo and maintaining the state. True. Chivalry will be expected and killing a fellow noble in battle or off the field is dishonorable and grotesque - but nobody will speak of it when civil unrest is common or they act in poor taste themselves.\n\nI write primarily on Discord but ideally do OC chatter on Discord and write on Google Docs.",

I am looking for someone who is literate and can write multiple paragraphs per response. This is meant to be a story that we create together, so input and ideas from both parties are necessary to make this enjoyable for both of us.\n\nA little forewarning, I only play original characters and would like your character to be an original character too. Straight off the bat, I'll let you know now that I don't do roleplays that are based on the generes of fandom, supernatural, fantasy, medieval... etc, so if that's what you're looking for, then this is the wrong post for you.\n\nAnyway, a bit about my roleplay history... I've been doing text based roleplay for about 4 years now, with a main preference for romance and slice of life roleplays. I have been told that I am a literate and detailed roleplayer, and I put a great emphasis on using correct spelling and grammar in my responses. In terms of response length, I usually write a few paragraphs, dependant on the situation. As a general rule, the more I get, the more I give back, but it's never less than a paragraph. \n\nI am looking to create a roleplay where our characters already begin in an established relationship together, and can explore that relationship throughout the course of the roleplay, as different events and situations arise in their lives. I know this may sounds strange and a little boring, but I have a few ideas in mind if you choose to PM me.\n\nAs for NSFW, I am comfortable with NSFW elements in a roleplay, but am happy to exclude them too. If NSFW elements are incorporated, I personally prefer my roleplay's to revolve around the plot and storyline, rather than the NSFW elements themselves.\n\nI'm hoping that I have expressed enough detail for you to be interested, without writing an entire essay. If you would like to roleplay with me or hear more about my ideas, feel free to send me a PM. If you have any ideas then I'm more than happy to hear those too, if you feel that they align with what I'm looking for.",

            "selftext": " Hello Reddit! Firstly, let me introduce myself as Froo-men-TAR-ee, or Froo, for convenience sake. I represent a Discord-based Roleplay group set in the Fallout Universe, specifically following the events of Fallout: New Vegas, and leading up to the prologue of Fallout 4. We\u2019re a group of friends looking for creative, inspiring new players to come and join our world, and contribute to the activity of the server as well as its ongoing story!\n\nWe\u2019re a group that welcomes all types of backgrounds for all types of characters, so long as it doesn't infringe with any lore already in the either the Server's established canon, or the canon of the Fallout games themselves. Our server contains just about every location and faction featured in a Fallout game, as well as some entirely new ones! All creativity is very much welcome; we even have a chat where players can contribute lore of their own to the world. We have no limit on word-count, so there\u2019s little pressure to keep up with your fellow members. In fact, there are little restrictions on writing style in general, save that we only ask that you keep your posts in third-person.\n\nFallout: Fault and Blame takes place six years following the Battle of Hoover Dam, with lore created and updated by our members to match the state of the wasteland during that time. We\u2019re always actively seeking new members to contribute to the lore with their ideas, so don't be afraid to let your creativity run wild! We also give players the option to play as either their own **original characters**, or **canon characters/NPCs** from the games themselves. We also allow your own, **personalised factions** to be brought together, via lore-submissions!\n\nCome check us out! We hope to hear from you soon.\n\n\\-[https://discord.gg/bQFfnM2](https://discord.gg/bQFfnM2)",

The story is a dungeon run into the ancient mountain temple of an older darker God, renounced by the church of the time. Strange energies and winds smelling of vile magic have been flowing from the temple and corrupting much of the surrounding land. Perhaps you're a cleric sent to investigate, a fighter/local hero seeking a bit more fame, or a devilish rogue seeking treasure and a but of coin to line your pockets, or perhaps you're a wizard/sorcerer drawn by the magic and its mystery, or (gods save your soul) a warlock left to rot from its previous patron seeking a new master. Whatever the case I'd like to run with D&amp;D races and leave it to a player to develope the characters backstory and the like. At the request of the player I can put together a few nations and give them a bit of life. My only request is no monks or rangers. If you find yourself interested just send me a DM.",

As the title implies, I am looking for some RWBY theme roleplay.\n\nI am open to almost anything you may be interested in, as long as it's RWBY themed. I only have but one request: I have an OC I'd like to play opposite of Weiss Schnee, whom I'd like for you to play. I don't mind playing in slight AUs, but I'd appreciate if we remained relatively close to canon.\n\nIf you're willing to do that for me, I'm up for doing anything else you want! Have an OC yourself you'd like to play opposite a canon char? Sure, we can do that at the same time! Wanna play with the canon cast but revisiting the main history, slowly changing the plotline as we go until we end up reaching a point where everything's different? Can do! You wanna scrap the entire canon cast (minus Weiss) and play entirely with OCs? I'm down like a clown Charlie Brown! As I said, I'm up for at the very least discussing any ideas you may have.\n\nI can work both in first and third person (though I feel that in a multi cast environment third person works better, it wouldn't be the first time I've worked with PoV changes), and I'd be up for doing this either on Discord or Reddit mail, though the former is preferred. Literacy is very much appreciated, and will get you absolute priority (if there's more than one reply, anyways XD)\n\nIf you are interested, feel free to PM me! Hope to hear from you all!",

            "selftext": "Hello! I'm just a bored college student on summer break looking to pass the time with some writing! I'd like to do a very cliche prompt that has probably been played out to death but for a good reason. I love sports and having played them my entire life I always found myself drawn to athlete x girl stories. I'd like to do a stereotypical popular athlete guy meets not so popular girl roleplay. \n\nThe prompt is very open ended so that we can discuss exactly what we want in the roleplay, the only thing I ask is to make it fun and interesting! Normal life is already boring, no need to play out attending a game/party/banquet like normal people. This isn't real life, so feel free to soap opera/rom-com it up in terms of how the story plays out or what happens. We can discuss to what lengths or how extreme we want the story to go.\n\nYour character can be however you want her to be, although I do have a preference for the even more stereotypical shy/nerdy girl trope. I'm looking for a slice of life/romance roleplay, and because of that I'm asking for 18+. I can do either 1st or 3rd person and usually prefer discord but can go with email if you prefer. The more detailed the better although I'm not a master writer so I don't expect you to be either.\n\nShoot me a message with your ideas for the roleplay and what kind of character you'd play, and what your writing preferences are. I hope to hear from you!",

            "selftext": "Hey, everyone. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile overplotting maybe a word of my own creation I have come to realize that it  is also my issue. I grew up roleplaying, and found I loved losing myself in characters and stories that would arise from the minds of me and my partners. As I grew older and grew as a writer I began to want to shape these characters and stories more and more, and giant brainstorming sessions would often occur between myself and my partners, creating interesting and epic stories in our minds that then grew far too overwhelming to attempt to write.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe issue has continued to plague me to this day. In fact I feel as though I have for the first time honestly realized why it is so many of my roleplays fizzle out so quickly. So here I am, looking for a new partner to help me break from this funk. What I want from you is limited, first off be an adult in case things turn racy, second come to the table with a character you would like to play. I'll bring a character idea as well. Then, after some brief brainstorming of a setting, let's run. Let's not plot much at all, let's let two characters of our own design discover the world as we do, and engage and grow through our interactions roleplaying them, instead of our brainstorming of exactly how their relationships/adventures should go.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI post 2-4 paragraphs per response and consider myself a fairly advanced writer. I'd like the same from you. I'd also love to roleplay via Discord or email. A partner that wouldn't mind the occasional ooc chat is always welcome as well, as you can never have too many friends. So if you're interested in my little experiment, shoot me a message and let's see where our characters and weird roleplaying brains lead us.",

We start out 4 years into the apocalypse in 2 groups of survivors in Atlanta. The 2 groups fight not only against the infected, but also each other as they dispute over limited resources. We 5 a variety of interesting roles including scientists, lone survivors, group members, infected, and more. We plan to keep the roleplay under 20 people so that people are better able to build close knit character relationships. It will be a long term roleplay.

I\u2019ll try to make this as simple as I can, but I\u2019ll take any and all PMs if you have questions!\n\nA little about me first and foremost - I\u2019m 29 years old, female, mother of two, living in the central time zone in the US ( GMT-5 ). My activity varies depending on the day and what I have planned, you absolutely should not expect me to be on 24/7 and I am almost exclusively using my phone for writing. On my busiest days you\u2019ll get 1-2 replies a day depending on the length, on my most free the possibilities are endless. I strongly prefer using Discord but if you have other media you are interested in, please don\u2019t hesitate to bring it up. I\u2019ve been writing for probably about 15 years \u2014 comfortable with 3rd and 1st person but prefer 3rd. Length varies on what I\u2019m given, but I\u2019ll gladly take shorter pieces to move the story along as needed. I also GREATLY enjoy portraying male characters although I will write female too. I like sending songs that remind me of our muses or story and making headcanons, gif exchanges, chit chatting ooc, etc. NSFW themes are fine, just let me know where your limits lie if you have any. \n\nNow onto the good stuff!\n\nSpecifically I\u2019m looking for fandoms and canons and the following are both the ones I want and the characters I will play \u2014 \n\n\u2022 Marvel - Peter Parker ( preferably comic or PS4 versions but can do MCU as well as long as he\u2019s aged up a bit ), Bucky Barnes, Jean Grey\n\n\u2022 DC - Jason Todd, Selina Kyle, John Constantine, Zatanna Zatara \n\n\u2022 Star Wars - Kylo Ren\n\n\u2022 Game of Thrones - Jon Snow, Jaime Lannister, Jorah Mormont, Daenerys Targaryen\n\nYou\u2019re more than welcome to suggest if you don\u2019t see anything on here you like! I don\u2019t really join group roleplays, sorry in advance, I just don\u2019t have the time to keep up with them. I prefer MxF relationships but can be swayed to any other LGBT+ depending on the characters and storyline. Please shoot me a PM if you\u2019re interested!\n\nThanks. &lt;3",

Given that this is our fictional version of Hogwarts, the rules have been changed; there are Junior Years 1-7 for children, and Senior Years 1-7 for adults and young adults, ages 18 and up. Do not approach me with underaged roles, you will be reported and blocked.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***Disclaimer***: Your character doesn't actually have to be a mudblood, I just wanted an interesting title. You can certainly make your character a wizard born to wizard parents if you like!\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u201cHave you got all your things, sweetheart?\u201d asked Chloe Blackthorne\u2019s mother, for the hundredth time that day.\n\n\u201cYes mum,\u201d Chloe replied, smiling, her voice high, soft, melodic and lilted with her posh British accent.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got your robes? A spare wand?\u201d That was her father, who had his heavy arms crossed over his broad chest, trying to pretend he wasn\u2019t feeling anything as he watched his two girls both leaving home for seven years at Hogwarts. He was failing, of course; his jaw was tense, his lips pursed, and the way he stood was stiff. All signs that told Chloe he wasn\u2019t as emotionless as he wanted everyone to believe.\n\n\u201cYes, dad, we\u2019re packed,\u201d Chloe chuckled, as her big grey owl Scripwick cawed in his cage, and her little sister\u2019s owl, Lola, responded. \u201cDon\u2019t worry so much; I\u2019ve already done this once before, remember?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yes, we know dear,\u201d tutted her mother, smiling. The paper-white skin and raven-colored hair ran deep in her family; both her mother and father had it, which had led to both Chloe and her baby sister Anita having it. Anita\u2019s stopped at her shoulders, while Chloe\u2019s continued on down her back in playful waves that ended in curly rivulets at the ends. Her bright green eyes nearly glowed behind her rounded glasses.\n\n\u201cWe just want to make sure you\u2019re as prepared as possible,\u201d her mother continued, reaching out to adjust Chloe\u2019s grey v-neck jumper, the collar of her white dress shirt, and her Ravenclaw blue tie and skirt. \u201cLook after your sister, yes?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need her to watch over me!\u201d Anita exclaimed indignantly, even as Chloe giggled and hugged her little sister to her side.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll keep an eye on her, mother,\u201d Chloe promised, beaming. Despite her grumblings, Anita nuzzled up against her big sis, and Chloe ran her fingers through the girl\u2019s hair to relax her, even as the train to Hogwarts howled into the secret, magical station.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d her mother nodded, then sighed. \u201cOh, come here!\u201d She moved in and pulled Chloe into a hug, which the girl returned with a delighted giggle. After hugging her eldest daughter, her mother turned and scooped Anita up in a tight hug. \u201cOh, my sweet girls,\u201d she whispered, as the tears began to well in her eyes.\n\nChloe smiled up at her father, and for several moments, the two said nothing, his burly arms remaining crossed over his chest. Then he clicked his tongue against his teeth, let his arms fall, and dragged his eldest daughter into a tight bear-hug that made Chloe laugh, even as the breath was squeezed from her lungs.\n\n\u201cYou write to us every day, you hear?\u201d he breathed into her hair, and squeezed tighter. \u201c*Every day.* Make sure Anita writes too. Help her with her spelling, you know how she is.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d she whispered back, doing her best to wrap her own arms about the bigger man. \u201cEvery day,\u201d she promised, and squeezed him right back as best she could before they pulled away. The bell on the train clanged, sounding the time for boarding. Her mother nibbled her lower lip.\n\n\u201cOh, I suppose that\u2019s it then,\u201d she mused, clutching her hands together as her daughters gathered their things. \u201cYou two be careful! Learn as much as you can!\u201d\n\n\u201cMake friends,\u201d her father growled, a hint of a smile lifting beneath his black beard.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll make you proud,\u201d Chloe announced, tears starting to well in her own eyes. Her mother tutted and reached out, cupping the girl\u2019s pale cheeks in her pale hands.\n\n\u201cOh sweetheart, you already have,\u201d she breathed, a trickle running down her cheek. She moved a hand to Anita\u2019s head, and smiled down at the girl, sadly. \u201cYou both have. Now, go on,\u201d she urged, nodding to the train. \u201cBefore all the good seats are taken, hmm?\u201d She smiled again, putting on a brave face as she watched two of the three loves of her life disappear onto the same train she\u2019d left on so many years ago. The same train she\u2019d met her husband on.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAfter depositing their luggage in the proper cart, Chloe led her little sister into the Junior cart, where the children who were doing their first bout of seven years at Hogwarts were corralled into closed-off booths. She felt a tugging at her skirt, and paused to look down.\n\nAnita stared up at her, lower lip quivering slightly.\n\n\u201cCan I sit with you, Chloe?\u201d she asked, softly.\n\nChloe smiled, and crouched to be at eye-level with her baby sister. \u201cWhy would you want to sit with me and the other grown-ups, Anni? Wouldn\u2019t you have more fun with the other kids?\u201d\n\nAnita shook her head, flicking her hair about. \u201cI don\u2019t wanna sit with the other kids. I wanna sit with you!\u201d\n\nChloe giggled, and smirked. \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t need me to look after you?\u201d\n\n\u201c*I don\u2019t!*\u201d Anita cried, crossing her arms over her chest. After a pause, though, they fell, as did her gaze. \u201cBut\u2026but I want you to\u2026I\u2019m scared, Chloe\u2026\u201d\n\nThe older girl felt her heart clench, and she sighed, then lifted her dark lips in a smile.\n\n\u201cAlright, just this once,\u201d she accented, as she brushed her fingers through Anita\u2019s hair. \u201cSince it\u2019s your first year and all. But next year you sit with the other kids, deal?\u201d\n\n\u201c*Deal!*\u201d Anita exclaimed, beaming wide. Chloe rolled her eyes, matching the girl\u2019s grin, and stood to lead her into the Senior cart. Together, the two managed to find a booth that was, for the moment at least, empty. Chloe sat down first, but Anita asked for the window seat, so Chloe scooted down and helped her baby sister clamber up onto the cushioned bench so she could look out the window.\n\nThen the door opened.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSince I'm pretty sure I can't link to anything NSFW here, but I would prefer this have elements of NSFW content, check my user-page for my profile that has more details, so you can know whether we mesh or not!\n\nSo, this is something of a...thing, for me. Harry Potter holds a special place in my heart ever since it captured me as a child, and fascinated me as an adult. I genuinely hope this takes off, and that some of you find some interest in this silly, charming, drama-filled, magical romantic story I'm looking to tell. Obviously, I made some changes to the way Hogwarts is done, so that we can have of-age students that aren't one year away from leaving the school entirely. If it's unclear - because I'm not always good at explaining things - I've set it up so that students can undergo two separate 7-year stints in Hogwarts; their first seven years is spent as children in the Junior division, doing things like what we saw Harry and the gang doing in the first few movies (minus some of the crazier plot points, *maybe~*). The next seven years are optional, entirely up to the student as to whether they want to return, but if they do, they do so in the Senior division at 18-years-old. (Chloe is 19, by the way, but she's a first-year Senior.) The seniors take advanced courses, like you'd expect of the older and more experienced class of students, as well as more dangerous courses that the children are kept away from initially (like anything to do with Hagrid!).\n\nPersonally, I'm looking for a romance story. For a story where your character and my character (Chloe, Anita is a secondary character/plot point and will ***NEVER*** be present in anything explicit) to grow closer and closer as their years in Hogwarts progress, as they start to fully realize who they are, and as they go on whacky, magical adventures of their own within the walls of the magic school we all love. Something fun to charm and warm the heart, but isn't spared the drama of school life, of being 18/19, and the adventure of attending a *bloody school of magical arts.* So it'll likely be a slow-burn type of affair, we certainly won't be jumping into the explicit anytime soon.\n\nThe gender of your character isn't terribly important this time, nor do I care if you're a male playing a female role, or a female playing a male role. I would prefer canons be kept as side characters and not used as your main character, please make an OC for that. Female characters and female (with *extra,* since I can't say what I actually mean here!) characters *do* go to the top of the list over male characters, but male characters are *certainly* not turned away, especially if they're unique and interesting. I also prefer messages be partly an OOC greeting, and partly an IC continuation of where I left off with the proper build-up to introduce and describe your character, but purely-OOC and purely-IC messages aren't turned away!\n\nCan't wait to hear from you all!",

            "selftext": "I've been writing/RPing for 10 years. **I prefer to write male characters.** That's my comfort zone. However, I'm willing to try to fill in side characters as needed. When it comes to romance I am only interested in straight F/M pairs.\n\nOur content rating can be whatever we agree on. I have no problem writing mature content when it makes sense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn my experience I work best with a RP partner who has a natural tendency towards some positivity/fluff/optimism. Creatively I lean towards angst and stoicism. Opposites attract. I can comfortably take you to some pretty dark places, but appreciate when you can help us balance things and lead us back to the light. I'm big on communication and balance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What I would require in a partner:**\n\n* You're female\n* You're 18+ years old\n* You enjoy writing female characters\n* You're interested in straight F/M pairs when it comes to romance\n* You're generally flexible and patient (because I've been inactive for a while and need to ground myself T\\_\\_T)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Bonus points that make us a good match:**\n\n* You enjoy chatting, brainstorming, discussion, etc.\n* You enjoy rapid-fire / live roleplay when we both have time\n* Our time-zones allow us some time to chat ooc\n* You don't mind borrowing plot / inspiration straight from existing media\n* You're not overly strict with rules (e.g. \"minimum 5 paragraphs required every turn\")\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am inspired by The Chronicles of Riddick. The first film, Pitch Black (2000), is actually my favorite piece of media from this franchise by far. Glance at the trailer on Youtube if you're unsure. I would love to use it to develop a RP.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's capture that gritty hard science fiction tone. Let's experience heart-pounding action. Let's explore a wide spectrum of emotion from light moments of humor, to triumph, to high drama, to loss.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe canon Riddick character, while one of my favorite anti-heroes, is a little too emotionless and predictable for me as a writer. I'd love to bring more humanity and depth to that role with whatever direction we choose.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**An Idea:** I'd write the character of Riddick. You could write a female character or insert a female OC. Romance probably wouldn't come into play... I can't see the canon Riddick character being involved in a romance, not in a true sense of the word at least. That still leaves plenty of room for action, drama, complex platonic bonding, whatever. We could loosely follow the existing plot, or we could veer off and develop our own storyline in this universe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Another Idea:** If we'd like to tackle a real romance plot, I can't see it happening with the canon characters. So we insert our OCs in their places. This would give us much greater freedom to define characterization, appearance, back-story, etc. I just think the setting/story is so cool that I would love to write in it. I'd write the main male character/OC as the mysterious fugutive anti-hero, complete with the unusual eyeshine ability (stand-in for Riddick). You could write the main female character/OC, I'm thinking of a young woman trying to diguise herself and travel unnoticed for reasons to-be-determined (basically overtaking any role of Jack/Kyra.) If we do this, we get to refine the characters ourselves, get creative, design them to compliment each other really well, or even set it up for a full romance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel like I should touch on my preferences, and this goes for RPing in general:\n\n* The \"type\" of male characters I like to write are stoic, clasically masculine, a little older (\\~30's) and more mature, sometimes morally gray, and you may notice a dark sense of humor.\n* The \"type\" of female characters I enjoy playing off of are softer, more kind-hearted, innocent in whatever way suits the story, and built smaller/petite. Yet still capable, smart, etc. It's great to discover they have their own strength. No women are being unironically pointed in the direction of the nearest kitchen when you RP with me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI like when two characters balance each other, their traits compliment each other, their strengths and weaknesses are valid but can also be curved by one another, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRomance-wise, I go for traditional masculinity and femininity in a pairing, how the traits compliment and contrast with each other... knowing real people are complex and much more three-dimensional than that too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEverything is up for discussion. The goal is to settle on something we both find interesting and fulfilling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI love sharing photos, discussing our characters, fangirling over the guy or gushing over the girl, getting excited about a new prompt, helping each other navigate a really serious scene - all of it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI prefer the immediacy of instant messaging but I work full-time, so email might be the most realistic option. I recently made a Discord account too. That seems to be a popular requirement.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you're excited about this send me a message. Worst-case scenario we've had a conversation about that thing we both enjoy doing. Take care.",

            "selftext": "Looking to dust off an old plot that I did with an old partner who I lost touch with. If you like something similar to black butler/kuroshitsuji, then keep reading! Keep in mind this is an original plot, not a fandom rp.\n\nYour character, is a noble Lord or Lady, their backstory entirely up to you, and how they get to the point of summoning a demon to form a contract with. My character is Aldred, a demon called forth by you, be it for company, personal gain, or power. But kne thing is for certain, you need his protection. For summoning a demon is not an event that goes by unnoticed. Other demons, angels, and supernatural beings will be after you, whether to harvest your soul before your demon, or just because they can. \n\nThis is very vague I know, but I want us to both be able to plot with eachother, and get what we bot want. I would love to do arcs and introduce many allies, rivals, and enemies to keep it exciting. This was previously a slow burn romance, and I'm happy to keep that part of it if you like it.\n\nIf you are interested, we can discuss futher in PM/chat. I can go into more detail about the previous rp if you are curious about that, but I would adore to bring this back to life \u2661",

            "selftext": "**This    will be a persistent request I will repost on a near-regular basis. I    don't check Reddit often during the day, but I check it daily. Whoever I am playing with, do not take it personally. It's just habit.**\n\nFirst, a few things about myself.\n\n33 years old, East Coast US, full time weekday worker (the whole 40 hours and more). Craving RP with any and all interested.\n\n*Please    don't be discouraged by everything here. Some things did require more    context to make sense, especially The Catch section. The best we can  do   is try with each other. :)*\n\n***Basic Requirements and Options***\n\nThird person RP only, Discord is necessary.\n\nWhat    I seek is female characters (IRL gender does NOT matter) opposite any    of my males/females/inbetweens aka intersex characters. In what, you   may  ask? Look below (anything in bold is a big want with me):\n\n\\-Modern (includes fantasy, **slice of life, drama. I love the whole \"love, marriage, baby carriage\" angle in any relationship I do in a story**).\n\n\\-Historical (**Medieval (vikings/Norse/Saxon/Crusades/Plantagenet/Tudors era**), Victorian/Wild West eras, **1940s/1950s/1960s play**)\n\n\\-Fantasy (this goes into either of the genres above)\n\n\\-Fandoms (Marvel/DC, **Final Fantasy XIV**, **Friday    Night Lights, Once Upon a Time, Game of Thrones aka A Song of Ice and    Fire, Peaky Blinders, Harry Potter/Fantastic Beasts/Wizarding World,    Vikings, The Last Kingdom**; others need ask. But PLEASE ask me    on the possibility of playing canon characters from these shows.  There   is no guarantee I may be able to play what you want. Feel free  to ask on   others!)\n\n***Writing and RP Style***\n\nAs    for visuals, I have gotten dependent on them. Superficial, lacking    imagination on images? It is. But I've played in public SLs over the    years who have regularly embraced them, so it's ingrained on me.    Usually, actors/actresses/models and the occasional art.\n\nI    favor adult writing and want the same from who I play with. Give me   the  romantic, intimate, and everything beyond it in detail (those that   know  what this means will get it :) ). I also enjoy players who like  to  talk  OOC.\n\n***The catch?***  \nI got it down to three simple statements:\n\n1. Embrace    communication. I love those who are around daily or near-daily. I  also   understand that RL kicks in, since I have it happen too. I'll  give a   heads up on anything, as long as I get one in return. And if I  feel like   something isn't working out, I'll say so. I only ask the  same in   return. We can work things out if we try!\n2. Be    open minded or cool. If you're bothered by being asked on what ages   you  play, or a greeting given while you're on Do Not Disturb, or   anything  petty like that, then please move on. I don't have patience   for those  who exhibit negative responses to something that doesn't   justify it.\n3. No    ghosters or flakers. You contact me and we work out an idea, I expect    you to keep vocal about it. You don't want to play anymore? Tell me  so   we can both move on and I don't bug you with a couple of messages a   day.  If I don't hear from anyone for a week (unless they give me   notice), I  move on. They may contact me later when they are ready, but I   don't want  to sit around too long and wait.\n\n***Conclusion***\n\nFeel    free to PM me for my Discord name or offer yours when you message (no    need to wait!). I apologize for the long winded post, but it's the  best  I  can do. Any interested folks who PM me, please throw in a   \"marvelous\"  somewhere so I know my post was read rather than the title.   :) I look  forward to meeting everyone!",

            "selftext": "So you might have seen my other prompt floating around with Caterina. Well this is basically that except I\u2019ll be playing the part of Serpico il Vitaleo, the son of an extremely wealthy merchant.\n\nI\u2019ll go ahead and jump right into things then! I\u2019m back at my clownery and wanting to do some low fantasy Renaissance-esque stuff. Basically something along the lines of A Plague Tale where plague-ridden, man-eating rats are wreaking havoc all over the continent.\n\nMost of the world-building stuff will be in the prompt, though feel free to ask me questions or work with me to tweak some things! I absolutely love plotting and building unique fantasy worlds and I'd love to hear some of your ideas too!\n\nThe gist of it is that while the brunt of the black plague (commonly referred to in this world as \"The Great Pestilence\") has already passed, it pops up every few years, normally during winter. While the infected rats can be ravenous, they dare not tread where the light touches. The rats fear any sort of light and can be killed with fire. Otherwise, you're pretty much outta luck when it comes to these plague rats.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring the harsh winters when the Great Pestilence rears its ugly head, Firenze is known to shelter a great number of fleeing peasants behind its walls.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSafety often comes at a cost, though, and many peasants become servants in one of the great houses to pay their way. Others smuggle themselves in via Firenze's numerous underground tunnels and sewers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019ll also just go ahead and drop the lore I\u2019ve come up with so far!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Great Pestilence occurred 300 or so years before this rp would be set. Around 800 years before the Great Pestilence, though, is this world\u2019s equivalent of the Justinian plague. This plague is commonly referred to as the Great Sorrow, since this plague essentially plunged the world into the dark ages.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe main religion of this world is also inspired by the great sorrow, culminating in the people's worship of light, as light appears to be the only thing the rats fear. That's why you'll see stuff like sun-matrons who can be compared to catholic nuns.\n\nAlong with the Lord/Light, people also generally worship or make offerings to lesser gods. There's a whole pantheon of lesser gods just generally termed as the \"small gods\" and people will normally choose one to pray to depending on their profession/life /whatever\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlchemy is also an accepted practice and has emerged as one of the leading ways to combat the rats. Ie coming up with ever-burning elixirs to keep the rats at bay. Alchemists have also found a way to harness the rat\u2019s power for war, as they\u2019ve managed to create what is essentially rat-nip. Launch that stuff at anyone or anything and the rats will soon swarm. Ofc a lot of this stuff is kept on the down low and is top secret.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat being said, this world also has its own sort of magic system but it's nothing too fancy lol. Basically, like in the game a plague tale of which this is inspired, there are certain people in this world who carry something in their blood that makes them immune to the bite. Some can even control the rats.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's just a handful of people who have the ability, though it varies greatly, to control the rats. When the Great Pestilence first occurred (which would be some 300 odd years before this rp/prompt was set) those with immunities began to emerge. Some are just immune to the actual plague the rats carry, others can walk among the rats unharmed, and then there's the precious few who can actually control the rats. Descendants of these people are called rat-catchers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe people who could walk among the rats unharmed/control them 300 or so years ago are called \"those that walk the blackened earth. Those that walked the blackened earth were able to accrue wealth during and after the great pestilence due to their abilities since, y'know, bunch of people dying leaves a lot of estates open.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe modern opinion of the rat-catchers isn't that high, especially by noble families since a lot of them think the rat catchers got wealthy off of the misfortune of the greater houses/nobility (which isn't entirely untrue). Others think the rat-catchers are pretty fly (sun-matrons and other religious heads especially) since even today the services of the rat-catchers are still sometimes required.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirenze was built after the great pestilence and its underground tunnel/sewer system is accompanied by a system of complex catacombs. This was basically built so to keep the rats under the city instead of in. The thinking being that if ya just stuff enough dead bodies (and sometimes live ones if the winter is really bad) then the rats are more like to stay below instead of coming up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso sorta like GOT, years are either generally warm resulting in \"fair winters\" or generally cold resulting in \"harsh winters.\u201d Years upon years of fair winters can go by, though it's generally no more than a decade, but it will always culminate in a harsh winter, which is when the rats become most active.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso then there's just cultural stuff that has come about because of the rats. Like the advent of the \"speaking-class\" which is meant to contrast servants/peasants. Servants/peasants and common folk too to a lesser degree are encouraged (usually forcefully) to keep quiet and only speak when they must (especially during the night, since the rats are known to be lured in by the sounds of life).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPeople also generally sleep later into the day since daytime is the only completely safe time to sleep. Night time also holds the chance that the rats could emerge and you don't wanna be caught sleeping when they come.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there's other small stuff like praying at twilight/sunset since you wanna make sure the lord/light protects you even in the darkest hour.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd that's pretty much it! Hope you managed to get through it!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo with that out of the way, I\u2019ll dive a bit deeper into the character of Serpico. Serpico is a descendant of one of those that walked the blackened earth. It\u2019s basically the reason his family eventually went from serfs to extremely wealthy merchants. The stain of rat-catcher can\u2019t seem to be erased from the Vitaleo name, however.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere\u2019s nothing that a political marriage couldn\u2019t fix, however! To bring an air of nobility to the Vitaleo name, Serpico\u2019s father has arranged a match between Serpico and the daughter of an impoverished nobleman. The trade-off basically being nobility for money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSerpico would be around 25 at the start of this rp and basically running his father\u2019s business by now. The Vitaleos have a hand in about every trade, from wine to wool and even money changing from time to time. The Vitaleos are also involved in the government of Firenze, though in a most unexpected way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurns out the tales about rat-catchers are true and the Vitaleos actually possess the ability to control the vermin that constantly seek to ravage their city. Serpico has inherited this duty from his father as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat outta the way, I\u2019ll go ahead and get into Serpico\u2019s personality. He\u2019s the quiet type with quite a lot on his mind. He\u2019s almost always in his thoughts, which can give off the impression that he\u2019s disinterested when he\u2019s actually quite engaged. Serpico also has a knack for art and the sciences, though his hobbies have mostly been pushed to the wayside since taking over the family business.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOther than that, he\u2019s rather cunning and would rather outmaneuver his opponents than outright get rid of them. He\u2019s a utilitarianist at heart and is prepared to make sacrifices for what he considers to be the greatest good. Definitely not a guy you want to get on the bad side of.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd finally! In regards to your character, you can play just about anyone. The one he\u2019s betrothed to, a servant, a peasant or common folk, or even a smuggler. There are lots more options but those are just the ones I could name off the top of my head. (I\u2019ll also go ahead and say that if you\u2019re looking for romance, I prefer you play a female character)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI won\u2019t be including a prompt for this one but will gladly write up a starter once we have the plot and our characters all figured out. If you\u2019d like a sample of my writing though, feel free to check out my other prompt!",

            "selftext": "Hello all! I've decided to go on a hunt for some roleplay partners. First, a bit about myself. \n\nI am a 20 year old girl who loves to create characters of all kinds and act out roleplays that are funny, romantic, and worth the time invested. While I do have my moments of business or tiredness, I am pretty free most the time. I roleplay in 3rd Person and my personal favorite genres are slice of life and/or modern fantasy mixed with romance. I'm not too picky on length but my comfort zone is 2-15+ lines depending on my level of creativity and how much the other person puts out. I do prefer LGBT roleplays although I can do straight roleplays. I prefer our characters to be able to change out on the who wears the pants role or for me to be the lesser pants wearer. Most of my characters are less masculine  or ambiguous. \nNow onto preferences for my partner. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMUSTS: \n\nMust be willing and able to have or create a decently fleshed out character. I have a character template that I use for my ocs if you need one. Character tropes are fine, although I take some issue with some but as long as they go beyond that trope and are their own person beyond 1 or 2 character traits, they're fine!\n\nMust have decent grammar and spelling. Now I know nobody's grammar or spelling is perfect, but I need to be able to understand what you're typing. \n\nMust reply at least every other day. I understand being busy and having times where you can't reply for a few days but id like to be notified if and when those things happen. I usually wait 4-7 days for someone to reply and will send the occasional 'hi' or 'hey' as a reminder. (Note: I also encourage you to be annoying to get me to reply. Sometimes I get distracted to the point of forgetting to reply or Discord won't send my reply or won't notify me when you reply. Send me reminders. If I ghost you it's never on purpose.) \n\nMUST NOT GHOST. I get being busy or even not wanting to roleplay with me. LET ME KNOW. So many people tend to ghost  when They get busy or dont want to tell me that they're not feeling me or the roleplay. Tell me. That way I know and can have a little closure. \n\nHave Discord.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEXTRA POINTS IF (you do not have to share these but it helps if you do)\n\nYou roleplay LGBT\n\nYou like multiple RPs, multiple characters to be going on at once (I LOVE polyamory)\n\nYou like talking and developing the RP as its happening\n\nYou are okay with rping as/with ocs who are mentally ill or physically disabled in some way. \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSend me a message telling me about you, what you like/don't like in a roleplay, and if you hit any of the extra points! I look forward to role-playing with you!! Please send the keyphrase \"Don't ask Don't Pas-tell\" somewhere in your message so I know you read through everything!",

As of recent, I've been on something of a hiatus and was hoping to get back into things, perhaps at a different place! So, here I am, with nothing but time on my hands and the hopes that we can make up some kind of adventure to take up our time!\n\nThat being said, I'm more than happy to spin a tale on any of your favorite genres, though the ones that I tend to specialize in, or are at least most experienced in, are sci-fi and apocalyptic themes! Still, I hope that doesn't discourage you from pitching anything else! I'm more than happy to work with anyone in order to make a world together that we can both enjoy, as well as any story!\n\nOf course, I'm also open to \"borrowing\" the world of whatever your favorite fandom might be, with some sparse exceptions! Video games, books, movies, etc, just let me know and we'll see what we can do!\n\nAs for my preferences on things, I prefer my partner be mostly literate, (I'm not perfect either, of course! Just someone that grasp things well enough!) Over the age of 18, and understanding of schedules! I'll never be on to get upset if you have to go all of the sudden, though if you feel the need to cut things off, please let me know! \n\nLast topic to cover, I believe, is the possibility of smut occuring in the story! As stated above, I'm pretty familiar with it, and are totally fine with doing it at any level that you're comfortable with, or not at all! If need be, we can discuss those preferences, likes/ dislikes, etc later on!\n\nIf this interests you, please don't hesitate to shoot me a message! I'm taking on about as many as I can handle without sacrificing any attention to any of my potential partners!\n\nPlease, have a great day!",

He had a very good reputation for it and often got invited to corporate dinners with his wife; he was never a fan of such formalities but he was always encouraged by his wife's presence. \n\n\"What the-\" He mumbled under his breath as he drove down the narrow road to his humble house, his eyes squinted as he attempted to observe the reason for a big log of wood to be lying down across the width of the road. Getting out of his car, he walked over to the log and tried to look around it for a way around but noticed it was a dead end and so, he was going the long way back home.\n\nAbout an hour later, Edward was standing by a dead chicken outside of his house, his eyebrows crossed in confusion as he looked around before sighing and shaking his head. Unlocking the front door of his house, Edward walked in, quietly shutting the door in hopes of not alarming his most likely asleep wife as he knelt down and started on the lace of his boots. \n\n(This is romantic. Set in a world where monsters exist, preferably 80s for a classic feel. The role you could play could be of a pregnant wife or a not pregnant wife to this man and the rest of the character is yours to play with! Discord is what I use. I would appreciate you sending a reply to the rp if you choose to message me so that I can see your style.)",

Far from the large cities nearer the capital and well North of the busy harbor towns along the coast, they till their land, tend to their crops, and pay homage to their small gods as both the seasons and tradition dictate. This has been their simple way of life for generations and all among their number are content to continue on in this way.\n\nOne can imagine, then, how they all react when a great stone castle appears seemingly overnight on a plot of land just outside the town.\n\nNews spreads quickly that the king has replaced the local lord with a new noble--a man with a dark and storied history. The mage that now oversees the village of Vesden, the other nearby towns, and the miles of land around them is ancient, they say, and was known at one time for both his cruelty and his power. Legends swirl around the mage like vultures around the dead, and the people of Vesden grow wary..\n\n\\----\n\nHello! My name is Dahlia and I am seeking an Advanced partner for a Medieval Fantasy story based on the prompt above! We can go a number of directions with this plot and I would love to hear your ideas! At the moment, I can only really handle one (*maybe* two) new partners, so please don't feel bad if I must turn you down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few things to note:\n\n\\- MxF romance only\n\n\\- be willing to play side characters as needed\n\n\\- be open to using Google Docs as a writing medium\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you are interested, please PM me with a sample of your writing and some ideas you have for your character!

            "selftext": "&gt;*There is no Emotion, there is Peace . . .*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The nightmares never stop.  Figures clad in white plasteel armor gunning down friends, no... *family*.  The gentle hum of lightsabers, the clanging of blaster bolts against their emerald and cerulean blades, then the sizzling of flesh as they hit their mark.  Agonizing screams as bodies of great warriors fall, collapsing into heaps as the order is carried out.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*There is no Ignorance, there is Knowledge . . .*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;She wakes on a stiff cot, the red mane of tendrils sticking to her back from being drenched in sweat.  Her heart thuds against her rib cage and her eyes, black and deep like the sea, stare wide-eyed in surprised horror at the tiny utilitarian room she'd been gifted.  Another night, another nightmare, another day going by wracked with fear of the unknown.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*There is no Passion, there is Serenity . . .*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Gently padding her way to the refresher, the Nautolan stares into a dingy mirror and blinks the tired out of her eyes.  She smacks her lips, stretches, and curls her lips to inspect her teeth.  Morning routines to distract herself from the horrors of the past.  Little ticks that remind her that she's alive, and things could certainly be much worse.  \"I'm alive,\" she sighs, closing her eyes and gripping the sink until her knuckles change color from the pressure.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*There is no Chaos, there is Harmony . . .*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Jedi Order fell with the sudden betrayal of the Clone Trooper army.  That was five years ago, and yet even now she still found herself waking up most nights trembling, terrified and utterly alone.  She was just a Padawan then, barely two years into her training under Jedi Master Jy-Karn.  Now her mentors are smugglers, pirates, spacers, and disgruntled soldiers.  She had traded the beauty of the Jedi Temple for the cramped spaces of starship freighters.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*There is no Death, there is the Force . . .*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;She returns to her room to dress herself, then drags her feet towards the cockpit.  The captain is there, as they always are, checking readings and monitoring their progress through hyperspace.  Another day, another job for the crew of the *Silver Lining*, which means another day of breaking laws and avoiding the Empire.  She doesn't approve of this line of work, but she isn't in a position to argue, either.  All that matters is that she's alive.\n\nHello there!  I hope my snippet above is interesting enough to you to really sink in and grab your attention!  I'm rat, and I'm a huge fan of Star Wars.  I'm hoping to meet someone here who is willing to run an adventure for my Nautolan ~~Padawan~~, who is a character I've been writing on and off for some time now!  While she has a past history, all of that is being scrapped and rewritten for the beginning of her tale in whatever adventure you come up with!\n\nI'm of course more than happy to help brainstorm ideas and lend what suggestions I might have.  I have roughly thirteen years of writing experience under my belt, and most of that is based around the Star Wars universe for long stretches of time, on and off!\n\nThings that are important to me when it comes to writing:\n\n* **Story:** Nothing is greater to me in role play than character development.\u00a0 I'm a huge fan of the story and the journey.\n* **Quality:** I'm less picky about how many paragraphs you write than how well you write them.\u00a0 We all make mistakes and I'm not going to judge you for a spelling error or some typos, but I'd like to see some creative descriptions and effort put into posts to keep us both interested.\n* **Communication:** Silence is the RP killer.\u00a0 If you need to take a break due to real life, or you're not happy with the direction the RP is going, please say something!\u00a0 If we don't communicate things won't last very long, and it's a two way street we should both walk together.\n* **Activity:** With my work schedule and lifestyle I can usually post once every three days to several times in one day.\u00a0 I understand if you're a busy person with limited time for writing, but anything beyond three days without communication is difficult for me to get into.\n\nWhen it comes to the NSFW tag, I'm open to NSFW and dark elements!  My character isn't a loose woman by any stretch of the imagination, but with the Jedi Order being gone and her being left to her own devices, there's the potential for romance and other themes.  Beyond that I certainly expect danger and darkness to exist in a Galaxy living under the tyranny of the Empire!\n\nThanks for reading what I've got!  I hope by this point you're interested in what you've seen, and you have some ideas you'd like to share with me.  Feel free to send me a PM with some basic details about yourself and what sort of interest you have in the story prompt listed above.  If you just send me a one-liner or post in my thread saying you're interested, chances are I won't get back to you anytime soon.  Show some initiative!  I'll share my Discord with anyone who sparks joy!",

I'm female myself, and your real life gender doesn't really matter too much. I do find it easier to RP with other females most of the time, but that's not a rule.  \n\n\nBefore I get into the plot, I'll go into the boring stuff:  \n\n\n\\-18+, 21+ is even more preferred.\n\n\\- Discord only. I don't RP anywhere else these days.\n\n\\- Third person only\n\n\\- Quality over quantity. I don't want one liners, but I don't want every post to be a book, either. \n\n\\- Relatively active, and looking for someone who is also active. One post a day is the bare minimum. Things happen in real life, and that's totally fine, just let me know, please. Someone who can make a few posts a day is even better, but that's not totally necessary.\n\n\\- NSFW. This is **NOT** necessary to be in the RP, we can fade to black, ect. But it's not unwelcome. Regardless, smut will never be the focus...That should be a given by now.\n\n\\-OOC chat. I like to talk to my RP partner, weather it's related to the RP or not, so someone who also does that is welcome.\n\nI think that about covers it, so onto the RP its self:  \n\n\nI'm totally willing to collaborate and exchange ideas for this, as most of it isn't super set in stone.   \n\n\nMy character is going to be a full fledged medium. ie; can see, talk to, and interact with spirits/demons/ect.   \n\n\nYour character is totally up to you. Weather they're  a medium as well, a 'ghost hunter' or other kind of paranormal investigator type deal, or just someone who is fascinated by the idea. Maybe they're just a regular person who gets caught up in it. It's up to you, really, and I'm not going to be too particular on what **you** do with **your** character. They are your character, after all.   \n\n\nI want this to be a slice of life/romance of sorts, but obviously, given the nature of my character, things that are normal for him, aren't exactly quotidian for the average person. I have more details about my character, but won't go into all of that here. He's an older character of mine, who I've revived, redesigned, and have been wanting to use again recently.  \n\n\nSo, if you're looking for a semi-spooky, strange, and even kooky fun type of slice of life RP, and made it this far, you came to the right place.  \nDM me with some info about yourself, and we can have a chat.",

I\u2019m a 21 year old female looking for anyone 19-27 that can play a male character whether you\u2019re actually male, female, non-binary, etc. it doesn\u2019t matter to me what you are in real life. All my plots are safe for work. I do NOT write smut. My roleplays typically focus on drama and romance with a hint of action depending on the role. I am pretty much advanced lit. Writing anywhere from a couple to multiple paragraphs. I also only write in third person. Please be creative. All \u2018hi\u2019s and \u2018hey\u2019s will be ignored. Here\u2019s a whole list of roleplays I currently do:\n\n*The Fighter* a story about a boxer/MMA fighter and his girlfriend, who doesn\u2019t approve of his profession at all. This can be altered to any contact sport and not just fighting , for example bull riding. \n\n*The Wolves* Many years ago a young girl was attacked by a pack of wolves in a place where wolves aren\u2019t common. A twist on your cliche werewolf story.\n\n*The Contract* the two top young rising celebrities don\u2019t get along at all, for various reasons. What happens when their managers go behind their backs and set the two up on a date? Forcing them to sign a six month contract , claiming to be a couple in the public eye. \n\n*The Vlog* Our characters are both vloggers and split up long ago. But what happens when they meet at a convention again? What does (Y/C) do when he finds out that (m/c)\u2019s new boyfriend is planning to propose to her? She doesn\u2019t know, but it\u2019s been told to him. How will the two handle running into each other days before everything could change?\n\n*Faking It* A young girl is making her way through life by stripping at a high end club for business men. She has a regular visitor that spends much more on her in an hour than most do the entire night. She practically only comes into work for him. But what happens when he\u2019s told he can only further his career in his family\u2019s company by settling down? He\u2019s been lying about having a girlfriend for years...\n\n*The Selection* A slight futuristic twist on your modern day Bachelor/Bachelorette reality tv show. Involves royals, rebels and so much more.\n\n*Fandoms* we can discuss Game of Thrones, Avatar the Last Airbender, Star Wars, and Harry Potter",

            "selftext": "Do you love pirates? Adventure? A sprinkle of Victorian romance and steampunk? Space?\n\nCome sail with us into the stars and beyond! Our roleplay is set in Disney's Treasure Planet universe but it is not a requirement to have watched the film in order to join. The main catch to be aware of is that when we say space pirates, we mean literal pirates - the shiver-me-timbers, ships-with-masts-and-sails kind of pirates. We are a small and intimate Discord server that is 18+ and literate, and we're planning to start a narrative filled with sea-inspired intergalactic creatures, swashbuckling action and adventure, and the potential for romance and drama among the crew!\n\nThe following are the positions we are seeking to fill:\n\nMaster Gunner - in charge of all armaments and ammunition. The Master Gunner oversees the maintenance and use of the ship's cannons and commands the troop of Gunners and Powder Boys during battle.\n\nBoatswain - in charge of logistics and maintenance; the boatswain supervises all activity on the deck such as weighing and dropping anchor or managing the sails. Their job is to inspect the ship every day to make sure it is fit to sail and to provide the captain with a report on the details. They also inspect the ship's stock to ensure that there are enough resources and rations and they are in good condition.\n\n\nIf interested, please PM me a brief intro along with your Discord tag. Thanks for reading, and happy hunting!",

The title gets across the idea pretty much by its lonesome, though if you're looking for some elaboration I tend to favor high concept projects that my partner's been working on for some time rather than just being something that they've ramshacked thrown together or plan on building as the RP goes along. The narrative would be told in a GM-and-Player relationship, and...that's about the length of it. I've absolutely nothing against fairly morbid, unhappy worlds similar to the Warhammer universe, though it goes without question that if it seems as if you've essentially just copied Tolkien and/or Dungeons n' Dragons when designing non-human races and cultures (if such things exist) I'll have little to no interest in it for obvious reasons.\n\nDoes bear some mentioning that, as will be presented in my writing samples below, I'm a novella/advanced writer and will require a writing sample in your messages to me. If you aren't looking to be quietly blocked, then it's advised you slip one besides the basic premise of what you have in mind and a Discord tag I can contact you with. Discord is a point of ultimatum to me; doesn't matter where we write we do the actual RP so long as we have a place for consistent OC chatter.\n\nAnd...that's about it, I think.

Also if you have an aversion to telling a partner things aren't working for you and you ghost, you need not apply.  \n\n\nI'm mostly looking for fandom stuff.  **But I suppose if the setting fits my anime-y tastes and stuff I can be arsed with something original.**  F/F Pairings only.  I'd prefer if romance stuff happens that it'd be something of a slow burn, even it's just my character being the one taking a while to warm up.  Any smut stuff will wait until justified by the plot and development and WILL NOT EVER be the center of the story.  Doesn't matter what gender you are as long as you play a Female character.  Most of them I can deal with it being OC/OC but there are some I don't list I prefer the other writing canons for ~~since most OCs are very barebones~~.  Said fact also keeps me from playing canons for other OCs, so don't expect it.  Also I'm looking for high fantasy/over the top action-adventure plots with BITS of slice of life.\n\n\nFandoms in Most Interested to Least Interested (but still an option):\n\nMiss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid [READ HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pCBTlHFEmpyAXeTxvxT6IOJJZsbVYPehwZ8RCc-lnPk/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nSplatoon\n\nMy Hero Academia\n\nMob Psycho 100\n\nLittle Witch Academia\n\nDBZ and MAYBE Persona ~~namely 5~~ [READ HERE BEFORE PICKING EITHER OF THESE!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-bfsF9AjT1ndmhCIzbFVLslZ9m2Hrg2myR911ktxrz8/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n~~I have an unconventional demon girl OC I can use for original stuff but it'd still be anime af~~\n\n\nThere are others I didn't list but that's cause most people just want to use their OCs anyway and they're ones I'm not so keen on rolling with other people's OCs on.  Or it's things I've had to leg all the work on progressing as they lied around like a corpse doing nothing and it just burning me out on it.  Oh right, and literacy, no one liners unless the moment in the scene becomes back and forth chatter.  I prefer detail and proper grammar.

I\u2019m a 21 year old female looking for anyone 19-27 that can play a male character whether you\u2019re actually male, female, non-binary, etc. it doesn\u2019t matter to me what you are in real life. All my plots are safe for work. I do NOT write smut. My roleplays typically focus on drama and romance with a hint of action depending on the role. I am pretty much advanced lit. Writing anywhere from a couple to multiple paragraphs. I also only write in third person. Please be creative. All \u2018hi\u2019s and \u2018hey\u2019s will be ignored. Here\u2019s a whole list of roleplays I currently do:\n\n*The Fighter* a story about a boxer/MMA fighter and his girlfriend, who doesn\u2019t approve of his profession at all. This can be altered to any contact sport and not just fighting , for example bull riding. \n\n*The Wolves* Many years ago a young girl was attacked by a pack of wolves in a place where wolves aren\u2019t common. A twist on your cliche werewolf story.\n\n*The Contract* the two top young rising celebrities don\u2019t get along at all, for various reasons. What happens when their managers go behind their backs and set the two up on a date? Forcing them to sign a six month contract , claiming to be a couple in the public eye. \n\n*The Vlog* Our characters are both vloggers and split up long ago. But what happens when they meet at a convention again? What does (Y/C) do when he finds out that (m/c)\u2019s new boyfriend is planning to propose to her? She doesn\u2019t know, but it\u2019s been told to him. How will the two handle running into each other days before everything could change?\n\n*Faking It* A young girl is making her way through life by stripping at a high end club for business men. She has a regular visitor that spends much more on her in an hour than most do the entire night. She practically only comes into work for him. But what happens when he\u2019s told he can only further his career in his family\u2019s company by settling down? He\u2019s been lying about having a girlfriend for years...\n\n*The Selection* A slight futuristic twist on your modern day Bachelor/Bachelorette reality tv show. Involves royals, rebels and so much more.\n\n*Fandoms* we can discuss Game of Thrones, Avatar the Last Airbender, Star Wars, and Harry Potter",

Not all is gloom, however, as the thrills of story work comes with both highs and lows.\n\n\n**Romance is on the cards if characters gel.** I will write NSFW scenes, elude or fade to black, all depending on what you'd prefer.

This realm is unlimited in regards to its whimsical and fantastical details. Any race that your character may be is welcome! For example, I like to take details from WoW, Skyrim, Final Fantasy, etc and incorporate them into the platform I have created. If you're interested in a deeply passionate, rooted-in-magic and drama plot, this is the story for you. Your character will be faced with many challenges throughout the fable, including battling a corrupt King and helping a princess break free from her horrific past. \n\nI play in 3rd person, present tense. My writing platforms range from Kik to Email, but I will be willing to write on Discord if someone seems promising enough. Before we write, I ask that you have a written description of your character so that you're prepared for when we brainstorm other plot ideas. \n\nThanks!",

I'm looking for someone 21 or older to RP with since, frankly, RPing with anyone younger is illegal if you catch my drift.  \n\nI need someone who doesn't censor themselves because my characters curse like a sailor, and violence never has a filter. That being said, Stephen King is my muse so if you don't like his writing style please move on because I write almost exactly like him.  \n\nI require you to be literate. Please. Misspells are totes okay cause I rp on my phone and my phone thinks it's funny to make me spell things like a toddler, but grammatical mistakes and lack of description will be a major no-go for me. You must, must, MUST post\u00a0AT LEAST\u00a0two paragraphs per reply. I'm not saying drag on and on, I'm simply asking for a little more than \"he opened the door and greeted\u00a0my characterand sat down\" because that will not fly with me. Also, when you reply, please\u00a0PLEASE\u00a0try to end your reply with some room for my character to either slide in easily or have an action that flows. If you don't know what that means, I don't think we will work out as RP partners. TL;DR - please write at college level.   \n\nI'm looking for someone who RPs fandom SHIPS. No OCs please! PLEASE BE CAUGHT UP WITH ANY FANDOM YOU CONTACT ME WITH!! Be flexible with your characters! Those who can play background characters or multiple characters are a huuuuuuge plus for me. \n\n* Borderlands  \n* Rick and Morty  \n* JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (4 &amp; 5)  \n* Homestuck  \n* Undertale / Deltarune  \n* Persona (3, 4, &amp; 5)  \n* OFF  \n* IB  \n* Left 4 Dead  \n* Team Fortress 2  \n* Boku No Hero Academia  \n\nPlease PM me what Fandom you wanna RP! If you don't see what you like I'm open for suggestions! This will be RPed over Discord. I am a full time College student and a Full-time worker so I'm usually not busy after work or on the weekend.  \n\nPlease do not ask me if I roleplay: Star Wars, Star Trek, or Game of Thrones. Because I don't.  \n\nPm me with your favorite color so I know you've read all my specifications. No color, no reply. Please also supply a sample of your natural writing. Sample for sample.  \n\nCan't wait to hear from you!  \n\n-- Kire",
