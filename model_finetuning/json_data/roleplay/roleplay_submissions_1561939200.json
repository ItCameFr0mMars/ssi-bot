I'll t tr y to.keep things short and sweet so you all don't get bored with my ramblings \n\nAbout me:\nI'm a 20+ girl, who just loves writing and making friends and roleplaying is just the right way to do both. I am at least semi lit, I write anywhere from a paragraph to like 7 paragraphs depending on my partner and how pumped I am lol.  I am usually free nights but I do have a job that keeps my busy every so often. Weekends mostly though, Monday through Thursday I'll probably be free.\n\nWhat I want from you:\nBe fun and kind, talk to me outside the roleplay, send me dumb memes and junk because I know I will. If you want ANY NSFW elements be over 18 or no go, and don't over do it with the smut, I don't roleplay just to play sex scenes. Quality posts, something for me to respond to is all. Have discord ^^\n\nOther Junk:\n\nI use drawn or cartoon/anime references, RL is a bit offputting to me, but not a deal breaker. I can play MxM, FxF or MxF or pretty much anything else honestly. If you want me to play the guy to your gal or gal to your guy just let me know. I love fantasy, sci-fi, horror, modern monster stories, anime based, harems, monster girls and pretty much everything else. I have some ideas I can get into after you DM me but if you are craving something don't be afraid to throw it at me! \n\nSo that's all I hope to hear from you guys!",

            "selftext": "Here's an idea for a novel I've been developing for a while. It's a sci-fi fantasy type story where, millions of years after humans go extinct, animals evolve and eventually form civilizations of their own. It's chaos at first, with different species fighting to become the ruling power over nature that humans once were. Eventually, several species decide to join together, throwing away even their predator-prey relationships in favor of pooling together their knowledge and resources and cooperate on forming their own nation, the Unified Territories. A century later, they have technology that exceeds what even the humans had, and the Unified Territories has become *the* political superpower in the animal kingdom, and the first and only case of sustained and global-scale peaceful alliance between so called predator and prey animals. This is where the roleplay will be set. Think of it as Zootopia but with animal-shaped animals and with more advanced technology. Unlike Zootopia, the Unified Territories member species have actually left their history of animals eating each other behind with minimal prejudice and discrimination, and to avoid the problem of other species being what they deem uncivilised, they have decided to deal with meat eaters by flat out ignoring them, resulting in the Unified Territories being extremely isolationist and perceived as a \"black box\" by animals outside it. I want the roleplay to be SFW only, and without anything risque or objectionable. I prefer Reddit private messaging as my medium. Is anyone interested in this?",

Dagoth Ur marching from Red Mountain. The Oblivion Crisis. Jagar Thorn usurping the Imperial Throne. To mortals the Elder Scrolls have always been maps used to avoid rocks within the river of time. They have been permanent and eternal guides\u2026 until now.\u00a0\n\nThe Moon Scroll has been destroyed and with it all prophesies used to direct the people of mundus through the river of time spanning the Second, Third, and Fourth Eras.

Most recently, [Dash](https://imgur.com/a/QyYkaIw), the Incredibles speed demon has taken it upon himself to go on more solo missions, breaking off from his family of supers and getting jobs done in half the time while the rest of his kin deal with the other villains.*\n\n*But today, or rather, tonight. Dash wouldn\u2019t be in costume to fight Villains. Tonight was the biggest meeting of supers since the legalizing of supers 10 years ago that very day and though Mister Incredible and Elastigirl were both absent from this meeting, their son, Dash was there, present in place of his parents and for the Incredibles family as a whole.*\n\n*As he entered the meeting room he looked around to see it was taking place in huge ballroom, getting a good view of the assortment of heroes present.* \u2018Three more hours and I\u2019m home free\u2019 *He thought to himself before running his fingers through his hair, answering the recurring question of* \u201cWhere\u2019s Mister Incredible?\u201d *With the basic answer of* \u201cHe\u2019s busy, Elastigirl too, I\u2019m here instead\u201d *Dash continued to talk and mingle as best he could, his manners being put to the test.*\n\n*He knew that if he messed this up his parents would never let him do something like this again, but..would that be so bad? Worse comes to worst he\u2019d be replaced by his sister or even his younger brother, the thought of Jack-Jack representing them in the newspaper making Dash smirk before chuckling to himself. He\u2019d stop his little day dream for a moment as he took notice of some more Supers arriving even later then him, among them was one he\u2019d get to meet. The appearance of new Supers and Villains wasn\u2019t anything new but it was still interesting to see. With Dash\u2019s interest now sparked at seeing another Super around his age (or slightly younger).* \n\nIf you\u2019re interested, feel free to message with your character and any and all information on them you\u2019d like to share.",

            "selftext": "So I know it's risky and all but I thought that not many people start a subreddit for strictly one roleplay. Nonetheless, I did it with the help of some friends and have made a story and concepts.  \n\n\n**STORYLINE:**  \nCenturies ago, in a time of great despair, humanity was threatened by a race of mana-based beings known as Unentities. These creatures were far too powerful for any weapon to oppose them, and soon enough, it seemed that all hope was lost for humanity\u2019s survival. A lone forest-dweller, though, was able to conceive a way to extract mana from Unentities and use it against them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSoon enough, mages spread throughout the land, fighting back against the Unentities, and in just a year, they were eradicated completely. An age of advancement commenced as magic was further advanced, making life progressively more convenient as time went on. It wasn\u2019t long before a way to weaponize magic was discovered, and a war broke out across the entire world. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe human population was reduced by half because of the war, and once peace was finally achieved, it was decided that all practice of magic would be outlawed, and the concept of magic was once again thought of as nothing but an idealistic fantasy.\n\n   \n\n\tCenturies later, though, in the peaceful kingdom of Raveria ruled by the benevolent King Harris, grief fell over the population when the King\u2019s wife was lost to a fatal illness. Harris vowed to move on and to help his kingdom thrive despite his loss, but when his only daughter began to show the same symptoms of his late wife, he disregarded his people, instead choosing to spend all of his time and resources searching for a cure, even resorting to unethical experimentation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDespite his best efforts, the King wasn\u2019t able to unearth a cure for his daughter\u2019s disease, and her condition was worsening by the day. No longer bothered by the consequences, Harris resorted to a legend passed down through the royal family, and led an expedition to an ancient burial site, where the souls of the deceased were said to wander. When he arrived, Harris encountered what he could only describe as a vision, in which a man told him that he could cure his daughter\u2019s disease if only he were to free him from his prison within the grounds through a chant in a long-forgotten language. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFar too desperate to question what he heard, Harris performed the chant, releasing every spirit trapped within the grounds, including the one who spoke to him, who bonded with the King. The day the king returned from his expedition, it was found that his daughter\u2019s illness had vanished, but more concerning was that all over the kingdom, gifted individuals were found to have gained extraordinary abilities, a large majority of which were beyond their control. Furthermore, those who obtained abilities claimed to receive visions of individuals who they had never seen before and were all seemingly influenced by those who spoke with them. It was soon found that when someone wielding what was then referred to as an \u201cAncient,\u201d their Ancient, as well as the associated abilities, moved on to whoever was closest to them. Along with the rise of those wielding Ancients, though, another noticeable difference was the king's method of ruling, which had become much more strict and aggressive than before, so much so that the king\u2019s daughter fled from the castle, disgusted by her father\u2019s actions. Now, with a bounty on the princess\u2019s head, and a new prince being adopted by the king, a select few warriors are called to the castle for what they can only assume is an important mission.\n\n  \n**Some Concepts:**\n\n**Ancients:** Elemental Spirits who were once Mages. They may possess someone and the possessed, unable to contain the elemental magical power, channels that power into a weapon.  \n**Monsters:** Ancients that took physical form, most look like monsters and deformed creatures.  \n\n\n**And finally the link to the empty subreddit:**  \n\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/AncientsUnbound/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AncientsUnbound/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you would like to join just click the link and DM me if you have any questions or want to be a mod.

These people usually like putting everything into a story, just like I do. That means we write a lot of paragraphs often, and sometimes not that often because of real life things. I am usually available though! \n\nI would like to play the female in the story and I really like most genres and types, except a lot of fandoms or games I don't know much about. No idea is a bad idea. *(Someone famous probably said that)* \n\nI hope my imagination can speak for itself in whatever pairing or world that we build. I am -not- looking for a GM/DM, just good one on one with a fellow writer who is literate, and wants to run away with me. First or Third person, I do not mind. \n\nMost plots I will take on, just because I enjoy writing so much. I have ideas and plots ready to go. So if you fit any of this and wanna see what happens, just drop me a PM with your Discord and we can talk..or say hello. :)",

I want depth and pain and beauty and drama and writing so delicious you could die. I'm not asking for much, just that special magic that can happen rarely when two talented minds meet a blank page and tackle it together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Come wander with me through worlds of our own making.\n\n# \n\nI am going to try and keep this as brief as possible while still offering as much information as I can so you can decide whether or not you think we'd mesh well before shooting me a PM.  &lt;3 **Bolded big stuff so you can skim, though**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 7/1/19 -  UPDATED CRAVINGS/IDEA SNIPPETS SECTION.\n\n# - UPDATED PARTNER GENDER PREFERENCES.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Also please don't comment here, PM me if you want to communicate about anything written below.**\n\n# \u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\n\n# The big compatibility stuff/my preferences:\n\n**\u2661** I have been doing RP/one on one writing in some capacity or another for **\\~19 years**. It's why I can write to what I humbly believe to be at least a **somewhat decent** level. Being able to write every single day for months on end for more years of my life than not has given me invaluable experience in character creation, development, world building, narrative, all of it.\n\n**\u2661** I mention this because I would very much prefer it if you are also on the more **advanced literate** side of literate in your writing. I ask that you are fairly experienced, with a firm grasp of spelling, grammar, and storytelling. I **don't** ask that you be perfect, I am a **better storyteller** than I am at grammar and punctuation and all that, tbh and as a warning. I'm gonna make glaring mistakes because the words were just rushing out too fast and I was blinded by the vision of the scene and the things I was trying to convey, but I do try my best.\n\nAll that to say again, we're both human, perfection isn't being sought here, but just write good, k?\n\n**\u2661** **I prefer female writing partners.** NB and trans individuals **of course** also welcome. Basically, as long as you weren't socialized as male, we'll likely get along. And I actually get along great with bi men as well, so you're welcome also. I'm sure that's putting all the str8 cis-dudes reading this right into their feelings, and that's fine, I get it, but this is my preference. I don't care to hear your thoughts on it. The answer is \"No, thank you.\" But best of luck to you. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- **TLDR: If you're not a straight dude and you want to write the male roles in our stories, and enjoy those roles, PM me!** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(Oh, the downvotes, they are coming.  \ud83d\ude02 )\n\n**\u2661** I do **only** play female main characters, and I understand if that is frustrating to you, but that is also my preference. If you don't enjoy playing the main male roles, **do not PM me**. I'm not about asking anyone to do anything they don't want to do. If you don't want to...please don't. \n\n**\u2661** I type much more **casually** in direct conversation via IM/DM, I **overshare** and brainstorm ideas constantly and will flood your messages if you're away with them.\n\n**\u2661** I am **only** interested in **hetero romance** pairings. I know, ew, str8 ppl. But the heart wants what it wants, as we all know.\n\n**\u2661** I prefer **GDocs/E-mail** for the actual writing and **Discord** for ooc chatter and brainstorming. I will bow to pressure if you ONLY use discord servers and you seem like a good potential partner, but I **don't** love the character limit on there.\n\n**\u2661** I **\\*really\\*** am not comfortable working with anyone younger than around **\\~22+** Like, I have **zero** interest and it'll be a flat **no** from me. Sorry.\n\n**\u2661** I don't know if this is a given, but I also ask that you **help** me populate the **side-characters** as needed for our world and our stories.\n\n**\u2661** I **do not** match **post length** just for the sake of it. I will always try and give as much as I possibly can in a post, but if we need to advance forward, or the post for whatever reason didn't give me a ton to work with or it's mainly dialogue, my reply will be shorter.\n\n**\u2661** **I do not like pre-made characters**. I expect that **all** characters used in our stories are made expressly for those stories.\n\n**\u2661** I write in **third person past-tense POV only**.\n\n**\u2661** I **only** use actors and models for **character references**, and I consider character references **necessary**. \n\n\u2661 I do **not** have many limits for adult themes and I do **not** fade to black but there must be a balance between those themes and storytelling, tipped in the favor of good, amazing storytelling and all the drama and pain of whatever situation plagues our characters. Please include your **NSFW** preferences in your introductory PM. **\u2661**\n\n**\u2661** SO yeah, just to make it a bullet point, I prefer **long-term** writing partners. We can certainly do **one-offs** for cravings, and leave and come back to stories and worlds and plots as we please, we are after all in charge, but I prefer to have one or two steady people I can turn to when I want to work on something either creatively for a few months or to satisfy a craving in the moment that may or may not turn into something long-term we work on or come back to, and to be that person for someone else as well. \n\n**\u2661** **Please don't invite me to your group role-plays**. \u2661 Thanks so much for the thought and I am flattered but I am only interested in one on one stuff for now. The most I would consider is maybe occasionally working together with a third party if you wanted to bring one in on discord someday or something like that. That could be fun, but I don't do group stuff.\n\n**\u2661** I **don't** tend to like playing **canon characters**. I will take ideas from characters and build something new around that, something similar, but still mine. I will also do this with settings, worlds, drawing from TV and movies and comics and books, etc. But I will never play a canon character and for me to play opposite one, as in you playing a canon character, would have to be a huge crave or a lot of convincing and pretense and plot that I like. It's rare, but not 100% unprecedented. (I would have murdered someone for a Punisher RP as soon as season one on Netflix came out, for example.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Take a look at what I am interested in actually writing just below, and if you find your interest piqued further and want to delve into any of these worlds with me and create some characters, get right into it and start brainstorming and seeing if we vibe, please send me a PM. Introduce yourself. If you have writing samples, send them. If you have questions, ask them. Ideas? Tell me them. \u2661\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What I want to actually write/loose plot/setting/character ideas -\n\n# \u2661\n\n**My biggest craves at the moment:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661 Merpeople -** Yeah, I know, ancient trope, but like...I've never actually done a roleplay like this and I've always, always wanted to! I'm very keen on it. I'd love to craft a world where there is a kingdom (actually, many!) in the ocean, and pair a mermaid/siren with either a human or ideally another merperson. I'd love to actually see her paired with a sea god, but I don't like to dictate tooooo much of my partner's characters. I like the idea of having different races and kingdoms relegated to different parts of the world's deepest bodies of water.  The only thing I ask is that any character you create must be mostly humanoid and not toooo monstrous, but I love the idea of incorporating for example lionfish fins or active/adaptive camouflage or really any combination that suits your imagination, as long as they have a human-like torso and preferably legs, as my mermaid will be the sort with \"legs.\" Transparently, I'd also love this to contain oviposition at some point or another as a result of a romance between our characters. (I promise that's the only \"weird\" thing in any of my prompts, it's safe to keep reading lmao) I see a lot of room for depth and drama and action though. We could dash some amazing writing and storytelling on this concept and make it great.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\u2661\u2661\u2661** Something with some pretty **heavy sci-fi/space** themes. A crew waking up on a colony, or scientists and colony members waking on either a ship, a colony, or a new planet. Borrowing some themes from some of the Alien and Bladerunner films would be a lot of fun too if done right and with our own spin. This is a big crave at the moment. I would love to develop something in this genre with a talented partner with similar interest in these types of stories and worlds. Maybe adding in some elements of Handmaid's Tale or Annihilation or something else to make it ours. I am always down to add in themes of horror, suspense, mystery. I love adding layers to stories as they reveal them to us like petals peeling away from a flower.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn a completely different direction but perhaps the same greater setting, I also have an idea I've been toying around with that borrows some concepts from Nail Gaiman's Stardust and...Guardians of the Galaxy? Of all places?\n\nIt would involve my character, a star in the most literal sense of the word, being plucked or maybe knocked from where she'd been radiating and singing her songs for millennia in a remote galaxy. I imagine this would have to be accomplished by a god-like cosmic being of immense strength, and while I am not opposed to the idea of it being an accident, I think great purpose would likely be needed to displace her, as she is herself a being of creation and light and power. She'd become personified and take on a human-like form, either by choice, force, or accident and then we could develop a love story that could ensue thereafter, entangled in some danger, adventure, drama, etc. I know this all sounds a little out there, and it kind of is, but that's also what I like about it? I like to take ideas and tropes and turn them on their heads and drench them in delicious writing and replace the characters with our own, so complex and beautiful we weep as they weep, we feel joy and triumph as they feel them. **I am really, really interested in something grand and sweeping like this that almost mixes fantasy with sci-fi.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd last, but certainly not least I have been wanting to maybe ease into something in the Star Wars universe. I've been a fan for as long as I can remember, but I'm no expert, though I do love research and delving into stuff like that. It would again have romance as the central theme, however. I love the Star Wars universe though, so it'd be really fun to play in. **Don't contact me about this if you're a rabid fanboy who is going to nitpick. Not interested.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have a few more ideas in these realms, too and have been in a pretty big sci-fi mood lately so if you'd like to explore some themes and try and figure out something that would make the both of us happy please send me a message. **\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\u2661\u2661\u2661 Montauk/New England** \\- This is my second biggest crave at the moment. It's summer, and while I don't generally care for summer, for some reason I've been wanting to write about hot days on the beach, saltwater smell, crashing waves. I want something ideally set in Montauk, New York. It's Hamptons-adjacent and I would like to play a local girl opposite your character, a married father of 2 or 2.5 kids, a wealthy vacationer from Manhattan or some other equally bustling city. His personality, job, etc is up to you, but I do want him married with kids basically.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI love the small North East US Coastal fishing town vibes and the local culture being invaded by tourism every summer but still managing to breed the rare romance. She'd be maybe a teacher, maybe a server at a diner who could be hired on as the nanny or baby sitter for the summer even. Transparently The Affair, specifically the first season, is my inspiration for a lot of the seeds of this idea, but that's where it deviates into what we'd like to make it. I do want drama, and a love story, but a messy one. Maybe some heavy themes like domestic violence in an abusive husband who she can't get away from, mental illness, grief, loss, infidelity in the affair between our characters, etc. And to be clear, though the concept of an affair probably does bring to mind some tawdry ideas, and there's plenty of fun to be had there, I want this to be a love story at center. Relationships are complicated. Love is complicated. I want a little complication.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Other fragments of ideas:\n\n**\u2661\u2661\u2661** Something set in a **small southern town -** Just maybe minus all the racism and misogyny? At least as far as our characters go. I grew up in a town like this, and leaving it has left me nostalgic for some of that undeniable southern charm. Slice of life-ish with drama and such thrown in. A romance, an affair, a love triangle.\n\n**\u2661\u2661\u2661** **Westworld** \\- Two guests meet in the park (doesn't have to be exactly like the one in the show) and fall in love. Adventure and danger and lots of fun and drama could be outlined for this easily. Open to some light sci-fi elements for this one. very subtle things, nothing too overt.\n\n**\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661 RDR/The Revenant/Western US in the 1800s** \\- Pretty straight forward, just delving into a romance set in the wild west. Instead of being in a park and from a modern or futuristic present, we'd be dabbling in some historical fiction. I mention these specific media examples as reference for vibe/setting, though I am certainly not opposed to borrowing themes from any source.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese would of course need to be developed a lot more, but I truly love that kind of collaborative development of plot and characters, so that's fine by me. I prefer to leave things as more of a loose skeleton without fleshing everything as far as plot and narrative out tooooo much, because I like for the characters to kind of help to illuminate the way as we go. **Brainstorming and sharing ideas is great, plotting things to death and down to the very last detail isn't much fun for me though.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u2661 No matter what kind of world and characters we work in and with, I want a heavy, unforgivably human type of story that will ultimately reward us with a beautiful narrative and characters that feel real and alive. Hopefully a friendship and/or writing partnership. Maybe the start of a whole new world we can dabble and play in at our leisure. That's always my hope.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want beauty and heartache and pain and drama and love and yeah, I want a little magic but not in the fantasy sense of the word. I want the magic of two creative, talented minds working together for a common goal and breathing life with words. I want a nice slow to medium-burn of a love story to start out hopefully many lovely stories we can tell together. There are universes to be made.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have characters already kind of fleshed out a bit in my mind and some ideas for side characters and plot and backstory and such for the craves listed here, depending on what your character is like and what we decide of course on for the tone and plot. I want some elements of slice of life, but forward-driving plot at a decent pace. I write with as much depth, detail, and color as I possibly can but sometimes it will be more casual, sometimes it will be really lengthy, just depending on mood.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**If any of this sounds good to you, please don't hesitate to PM me and we can go from there. Most of the above can be worked out.**\n\n# \u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\n\n# Bonus rambling:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u2661 Usually having the male main character at least a couple of years older than the character I am playing will end up being my vibe. I like to make female characters that challenge and assert against men who might consciously or unconsciously use age as an excuse to dismiss or otherwise silence or stifle them at the beginning, or if they're not the type sometimes also perhaps to use that juxtaposition of age and character for fun because of some of these societally pre-conceived notions, etc.\n\n\u2661 Taking breaks for burnout is totally fine, I will probably take a couple over the course of say, a year, and that's why I prefer having long-term partners. Ditching though, I don't appreciate and try not to do myself. Just let me know, I get it. We're human beings with lives and mental and physical health needs. Or maybe we just aren't meshing? Don't sweat it, just tell me. I will certainly try and do the same.\n\n\u2661 I can get **very** into world, mood and character building and have in the past collaborated on playlists, character references, setting reference, mood boards, etc. with writing partners to help expand on the world based on the mood, using these things as a way to further get on the same page so we can write in both the same tone and from the closest that I think two minds can probably get when working on one world together from two totally different upbringings, sometimes writing styles, background, history, experience, mood, locations in the world, etc. There are a lot of variables, but I feel like discussing characters and setting and vibes and themes you want to include and songs that make you think of a character or a moment or a feeling related to the story and all of that can level some of those variables and bring two people to the same place creatively. It's magic when it happens, and if you've experienced it you know it, and I guess that's what I am looking for again. A little magic, no big deal. Right?\n\n\u2661 I like to tell stories that can sometimes span generations. Maybe even time and space. But most important, stories about families and characters that feel real and who come to life for us. I like having things that I write with long-term writing partners eventually be woven together in some way or another, so that it's a cohesive world, even if in one story we're dabbling in Science Fiction and then in another maybe historical fiction or slice of life or anything in-between. I love doing stuff like that and being collaborative about world building and borrowing characters and adding generations and ancestors and relatives to families as we go and as the opportunity arises no matter the genre or era we are writing in. I've yet to meet a plot line I can't at least loosely tie together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# PM ME NOW IF YOU'VE MADE IT THIS FAR! \u2661",

            "selftext": "Before the happenings of Battle Tendency, there was another series of events that transpired in the city of San Fransisco. \u2018Golden City\u2019 takes us to the 1930\u2019s, where immigration, crime, and fashion were the peaks of society. The Speedwagon Foundation didn\u2019t have much influence in this part of the country yet, and that is why it is relatively unknown...until now.\n\nBecause of the rapid expansion that San Fransisco saw in the 1900\u2019s, organized crime was easy to maintain and come across. This also went for the police departments as well; when times were tough, some officers would come home with nice bonuses they\u2019d received for turning a blind eye, framing an individual, or committing worse acts to help out the crime families. One in particular was a large immigrant family from Italy known as the Valdina\u2019s. They\u2019d come to America quite early in the immigrant spike, and had no competition when they\u2019d decided to set up shop and start their syndicate; they even contributed to making their surrounding neighborhood a practical slice of their homeland, naming it \u2018Fetta Della Patria\u2019 which roughly translated to \u2018a slice of the homeland\u2019.\n\nEventually, however, the Valdina\u2019s ran into some competitors. Seeing the potential America had, another family of criminals had decided to start operating in the area, only these people weren\u2019t from Europe. A group of Yakuza known as the Kodo-Kai were the new threat to the Valdina crime family, and they\u2019d brought all sorts of voodoo magic with them. Immediately they started recruiting off the street, promising those that joined \u2018a lifetime of power and wealth\u2019. What they gave those that joined was unknown.\n\nYou have been thrust into this world of conflict. Whether you\u2019re a normal housewife, a up-and-coming gangster, a bank clerk, or a hobo trying to survive, the Golden City is waiting for you to leave your mark on it one way or another.\n\nhttps://discord.gg/RvaDhMb",

What camp were you in?  \n\n\nMe?  \n\n\nI was a solid Greek God loving kid, and it never stopped. You can imagine my delight upon discovering Lore Olympus.\n\n  \nLore Olympus has kind of exploded in popularly, and after I *finally* read the first chapter last week...I was hooked! The Gods, the Universe, the Story, the Romance! I'm absolutely head over heels for it. So, it is of no surprise to anyone that I am here searching for someone to explore this universe.  \n\n\nMy hope is to play one of the unmentioned goddesses or mortals to create a delightfully sweet romance of our own. I would love a partner of any gender to play any sort of character they want from God to Goddess to more! If you so desire I  would even be happy with one of the already established characters ( I mean,come on, you have to love Hermes,right?)   \n\n\nHere's a quick list run down of what I'm hoping for in a partner   \n\n\n* 20+ if possible of any gender! (I'm 27, and it's nice to have someone closer to my age to write with.)  \n\n* Detailed, Multi-Para Posts  (I love being captivated by words, falling deeply into a story. Not every post has to be a novel, but I like hearing about the little things.)  \n\n* Playing through Discord of Google Docs (Let's look back on our hard work!)  \n\n* Someone willing to swap music playlists, indulge in character mood boards, and more! Let's get attached to our characters together.  \n\n*  Let's be friends! If we're role playing together we obviously have something in common. We should be able to speak comfortably out of character.   \n\n*  Most important? Accept that I am a hopeless romantic. I like the sappiness of it all, and I hope that you will too. Some call it cheesy but I call it sweet.   \n\n\n  \nIf any of these sounds like you...hit me with a PM! Let's see what sort of Olympus love story we can create!",

            "selftext": "  \n\nThe dirt hadn\u2019t been red in years. Centuries. No one alive had walked upon how it once was. Not to say it had been forgotten. That ill-fated first generation of colonials. The now near mythic terraforming corporations. The dust blasted data from long dead rovers. But that place, that world, was gone. Like Selene, now a sea of shimmering neon, like Aphrodite, now a temple paradise of luxury and life, the god of war had been made a home. Darkened red weakened to promising brown to taunting yellow to stoic orange. It remains a harsh place. The harshest of the lot. But there is air. There is water, if you know where to look. There is gravity. There was no need to establish a corporate a state there, Luna had already been claimed as that twilight libertarian playground. The local Venusian Parliament had its own issues, deciding to fully embrace its wealth equality and elitism, reverting to an aristocratic oligarchy hauntingly similar to 19th century Britain. The Earth Federation dismissed the planet as the failure that it was. A necessary experiment between the moon habitation project, and the staggering success of Venus. There was no grand colonisation wave. No dedicated federation support, just another office in New York dedicated to making sure the new settlements paid their tithes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInstead of private corporations or Federation colony ships came the runaways. The outlaws. The left-behind and the disillusioned. The desperate and the brave. They were the true mothers and fathers of Mars. There was little influence on that wild and untamed world. The Earth Federations cared little for the few hundred thousand hiding out in the landscape of searing dunes and vast canyons. Most became little more than subsistence farmers, despite the near barren nature of the soil, cultivating quiet, unassuming and harmless lives as towns grew up around them organically over the years. Land was cheap there, belonging to one or another ancient prospector company which couldn\u2019t wait to get rid of the rights bought in more optimistic days. Serious investors would normally stick off-world, keeping to orbital and deep space habitats, but that didn\u2019t stop small firms and groups sensing small gaps in market otherwise dominated by giants. Years later and some of the more green areas even had Venusian and Federation based establishments. Training camps for military personal. Prisons and light industry. Even boarding schools for Venusian nobles, supposedly offering the best university across space. It was rural. It was easy. It was slow. It was peaceful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo how had it come to this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMeteor storms had become a silent part of normalcy on mars. It was easy to find places of the world unstained by the light pollution from megacities like Luna\u2019s Tranquillity and the unflooded slums on Earth, you just had to get in a car and drive. Once upon a time people gazed falling stars in awe. On mars, a falling star is a shattered ship. The organs of some tattered warship torn to shreds in high orbit. Rebel or Federation, it didn\u2019t matter. A falling star was an escape pod with its re-entry mechanism fried, the, hopefully already dead, inhabitants boiling into mist. They were the un-retrieved shells of sons and daughters. They were the souls of the lost screaming: \u2018Look at me! Look at me!\u2019 for half seconds more as they fade eternal into the sky. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWas it the protest of \u201985? The rising taxation? The sweet nothings of old man Mihhailov? The innocent look in the eyes of his daughter? Certainly not with the Martian declaration of independence. Not with the founding of the Kingdom of Cydonia, not with the charter creating the United States of Mars. Not with the repainting of the fleet, the Federation attack from Phobos, the battle of Fossae, the militia raids, the terror bombing of Austin back on Earth, the military draft on Venus, the Lagrange 2 colony disaster, the Hannibal City massacre. All that came later. The war started earlier. Much earlier. Perhaps it had always been going on. It certainly felt like it to the weathered Kalashnikov wielding Martian soldiers, the Venusian farm boys forced into the Federal Marine Corps, the Earth born fleet officers who gaze with bloodshot, sleepless eyes into the inky darkness. For the men and women whose blood turned Mars red again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\---\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am looking for a partner to roleplay with me on discord for a gritty science fiction fantasy RP. The main story will revolve around a group of characters going through a great war/rebellion on the planet Mars. While set an unknown period of time in the future, I do not want the focus of this RP to be technological advancement. Rather, the main theme would be exploring how human culture and society changes over time, the idea of nation states, and, of course, the great fact that \u2018War is Hell\u2019. I also imagine there to be some similarities to the American war of Independence and a similar atmosphere to American 18th- 19th century. This is not strictly by design, but it might be an interesting aspect. Also, please understanding, not everything will be set on Mars. Ive put great thought into the atmosphere and feel of the places ive mentioned/alluded to, in this starter and all of them would be interesting to go into with more depth. That includes the eternally night time city of Tranquillity on the moon, a corporate cyberpunk dystopia, the authoritarian hypocrisies of Venus, a beautiful planet of life filled crystal seas and sun baked archipelagos, as well as the remains of old Earth, her scarred environment showing the both the wounds we have inflicted upon her, and the damage she has caused us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got this idea from the story \u2018The Beguiled\u2019, about a Union soldier imprisoned and nursed back to health in a Confederate boarding school. It sort of spiralled out from there into something much bigger.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019d like you to play a character who is initially unfamiliar with Mars and swept up into the conflict. I think  a noblewoman attending one of the above mentioned Venusian boarding schools would be a very fun role, but there are other ideas that could be really interesting, which we can talk about together in more depth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI take a GM style of roleplaying, taking control of setting and most characters, providing a story which ultimately your character stars in. This allows you to experience the plot, meet new characters and learn about them as your own character does. It means I can continually surprise you with twists and offer fun clues and foreshadowing to ongoing mysteries. I will never speak for your character or describe their action. All that is on you. Its your character. I understand that this style is not for everyone, as there are some who enjoy plotting stories out beforehand, so no hard feelings if you aren\u2019t so keen. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think that romance should be a large part of a story like this. Love is probably the most positive human thing we have and I\u2019d expect it to feature in this RP which will also explore some of the most negative things about us. That said, I don\u2019t much care which characters fall in love with each other and indeed, I don\u2019t plan anything on it. Anyone could be paired with anyone. We will see what organically occurs through writing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI normally write 200-500 a response, one or two responses a day. I don\u2019t expect a partner to match me out of obligation, but I would like at least over 100 words. A lot can be said about even the smallest of actions or sentences. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you have any questions, please ask in the comments below so others might read them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope to hear from you soon.",

My favorite genres are anything with magic - such as fantasy, urban fantasy, supernatural. But I also love mystery, action/adventure, thrillers, sci-fi, university, and romance. I'm especially looking for a partner who is willing to do a slow burn romance within a magical setting. I love playing different types of characters and am completely fine with playing male or female or anything else, but I really want to play a female as my main this time around.\n\nThe big things for me is plot and character development, so I want a partner who is looking to develop their characters and enjoys a good plot. I have tons of plot ideas, specifically one that involves our characters being forced to travel through multiple worlds by an unknown being that way we can explore out characters in different settings/genres. But I'm open for trying out any plot ideas you might have, not just mine. In any case, I don't want to be the only one pushing the plot around, so my partner has to be more of an active player than a passive one.\n\nI write paragraph/multi-paragraph format and prefer a partner that does the same. As to time committment, I prefer someone who is flexible. Sometimes I have lots of free time all at once and can do a constant flow of posts, sometimes I can only post once a day. Mostly I'm probably somewhere inbetween the two. Lastly, I prefer a partner that is able to deal with mature themes such as violence, some of the more risque stuff, and sometimes if the characters have to deal with dark elements. There is a lot of stuff that's a no-go for me, but a person who is easily triggered won't be a good fit.\n\nI do not play fandoms. If interested drop me a PM and we can talk it out if you have any questions. \\^\\^ Marking this NSFW since RPs can deal with different mature themes.",

            "selftext": " \n\nHello Reddit!\n\nI am currently a member of a roleplay group called Decade of the Dragon, and we are looking for members! The group is a high fantasy plotline that takes place in a world inspired partially by the book *Eon: Dragoneye* by Alison Goodman. (Knowledge of the book is not necessary)\n\nThe roleplay takes place in a small village in a world that exists on the edge of cataclysm. In the past, eight Dragon Gods born from the bodies of the shapeshifting ancient gods kept the world in order. After a golden age, the Dragon Gods disappeared, and the world fell into chaos as the earth crumbled, fell into itself, and millions died. Humanity had to reclaim what was lost, and went about trying to live in the brave new world that still had swaths of corruption and consistent disasters on a regular basis.\n\nThe small village, named K\u016b y\u00e8, was a place of important magical potential. Every twenty years, a child who showed mystic potential was trained in the way of the dragon gods, and learned a tiny fragment of their magic power. Then, the coming of age ceremony would approach, and the youth would be dressed in the garments of the gods before them, and they would stand at the edge of a gigantic cliff with a wasteland below them, and fall.\n\nAfter hundreds of years of this failing, those sacred garments are stained with blood. The world grows more unstable and volatile by the day, and the ceremony continues to fail decade after decade. The ceremony has been dubbed the ceremony of death, and the flames of hope have been reduced to a few burning embers. Eight youth gather around the cliff, hoping that they will be able to spread their wings and fly.\n\nSo this is where the roleplay will begin, but we still need a few people to fill the roles of the eight dragons. It is first come first serve on those, but there are many other important roles to fill like the royal family of the human kingdom, who will be sheltering the young dragons, but may not be happy about not being big men on campus anymore. Other roles of importance will be created, and we would love for you to join us! If you are interested, leave a comment or PM me and I can give you an invite, or give you more details.",

            "selftext": " \n\nHi guys.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a veteran role player. After being around for well over a decade, I find myself enjoying the hobby less than I ever have. I've grown tired of the disrespect, and how mentally ill some people are who are drawn to the hobby (I've had some VERY bad experiences). So, I'm posting here looking for respectful role plays (18+) to create great stories with. I'm looking for a partner that likes to get in the creative process with me. I hope to find a partner to help me rekindle my old love in role play through playing gratifying stories. Specifically, I look for writers (male / female playing male) who write in third person and excel at it. If you can only give me a single paragraph per post, you probably aren't the person for me. Understandably, I'm not an insane elitist either. I don't require a page of writing, but something above minimum effort would be great.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm fine with writing NSFW content, as I am well over the legal age. I simply don't want the dirty stuff to completely take over the story. There is a sweet spot where everyone gets what they want, so let's find it together. I only write over Discord, and I have a pretty regular schedule, so I'll have time to reply several, if not more, times during the day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have a few vague ideas off-hand, though I'm totally open to anything. There aren't any genres in writing that I shy away from.\n\n* A good ol' fashioned epic fantasy quest.\n* Star Wars -- I would like to write a story about Imperials slowly discovering how horrible the Empire is. These two eventually make the jump, escape the Empire, and start their own Rebel cell.  \n\n   * I know the Star Wars universe pretty well, so this isn't the only time period I'll play in. My favorite era is the Clone Wars (that animated series is wonderful).\n* Scifi-- For various reasons, it has become necessary for my character to escape a planet. With no proper ride, she targets your guy, musically 'torturing' him until he agrees to help her, thus beginning their joint adventures.\n* Modern / Fantasy - A vigilante story--preferably a darker tone here.\n* Modern / Realistic - Two druggies descending together deep into addiction, then attempting to pry their way out.\n* Modern / Slice of Life - A general romance story--perhaps high school sweethearts who haven't seen each other in years reuniting again, so on and such forth.\n* Post Apoc - As the zombie craze dies down, I find myself still longing to write a dark post apocalyptic story near the beginning of 'the end'.\n* Overwatch - It's been a long time want of mine to do a Solider 76 / Mercy story line starting prior to the fall of Overwatch. What little tidbits we've gotten on their pasts just makes me more hungry to fill in the gaps.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf none of these strike your fancy, PM me with your ideas. I hope to find some people I can have a good time with again. Thanks!",

Since my long-term partner decided to end our roleplay I've been feeling lost and in need for something new to get my teeth into. \n\nI'm a 24 year old female from the Netherlands and I love slow burn romances, forbidden romances and love-hate stories with a plethora of drama and action. I have a couple ideas we could work with, but I'm definitely open to yours as well! \n\nI'm fairly active and typically post at least 3 times a day. That being said I will only RP with people above 20 since I'm uncomfortable with anyone younger than that. I prefer discord as our platform since I can be organised there and edit posts. I usually type a paragraph or 2, sometimes more when the situation calls for it. Third person is what I use the most since its easier for me to include side characters. If you really need me to, I'll consider first person. \n\nEnglish is my second language. I'm not perfect and I don't need you to be either, being active and invested in the story is all I ask. Don't be afraid to shoot me a message. \n\nThank you for reading \ud83d\udda4",

Here are some things about me as a roleplayer, and things that I\u2019m looking for in a roleplay partner. \n\n1) I\u2019m simi-lit/lit. The length of my replies honestly depend on how much I enjoy the roleplay.\n\n2) I\u2019m looking for a long-term roleplay partner.\n\n3) Yes, everyone makes errors, but please try to spell everything correctly/use correct grammar. \n\n4) I will not roleplay any sort of pedophilia or sexual harassment. I (of course) respect any triggers.\n\n5) I\u2019m okay with smut, but I don\u2019t want the roleplay to be based around smut. I want smut to be a side thing, not the plot.\n\n6) I want to roleplay realistic themes. \n\n7) I reply as often as I can (usually every day). I\u2019ll give you a warning if I wont be able to reply for a while.\n\n8) I\u2019d rather lead up to the relationship, not just jump into a roleplay with two people who already have crushes on each other.\n\n9) I prefer to roleplay on discord, but I\u2019ll roleplay anywhere as long as it\u2019s not over phone number.\n\n10) Please don\u2019t use text talk.\n\n11) Please don\u2019t use aestricks. (I\u2019m fine with either 3rd or 1st person POV).\n\n12) Unless it\u2019s a Hamilton ship, I don\u2019t want to roleplay as unoriginal characters, because I\u2019m not in a lot of fandoms.   \n\n\nI\u2019m open to any plot, but this is one that I have in mind:  \nMuse A and Muse B are college roommates. Their first interactions with each other are sour and they almost immediately begin a feud, but their small dorm makes it impossible for them to ignore each other. After a while on getting on each other\u2019s nerves, they begin a contest of who can annoy the other the worst. This begins a war of annoying behavior and pranks. Eventually, they start to bond over their \u2018war\u2019, and they start enjoying each others company.\n\nMessage me if you would like to roleplay!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPS\n\nEven if you see this a long time after it\u2019s posted, I\u2019m always looking for new roleplay partners and I\u2019ll always reply as soon as I can, so please still message me!",

Rookie mistake, I know. But I suppose I am a rookie when compared to others. Say, for example, my character and yours are having a conversation, and I want another NPC-type character to join our conversation to further the plot. How would I go about doing that? Do you have any examples? This isn't the only scenario, obviously, so I suppose I'd like some help with this in general. \n\nAny assistance would be greatly appreciated. If it turns out that this topic is too lengthy for the comment section, feel free to DM me or ask for my Discord. Once again, I apologise if I seem curt or unfriendly, and I assure you, I'm not meanie.",

            "selftext": "Hey there. I'm looking for someone to create an amazing, gripping story with. The main theme I like to play is romance but we can also add different elements into it if you wish. Please note though, fantasy is a big no! I would really appreciate it if you were reliable, and tell me if it got boring because then it's fair. If you ghost me, don\u2019t expect a sudden second chance. Of course we will both have our own personal lives but I\u2019ll always communicate healthily and let you know when I\u2019m busy. If you're going to message, be serious about this too and have a clear idea about what you want. I can do first or third person, I can change my preference if needs to be. Honestly, I will NOT accept one liners nor will I respond back to you if you're just gonna ghost. I've had enough of people just coming along for short-term purposes when this is LONG term. I cannot stress that enough.\n\nMy list:\n\n\\~Friends from childhood.\n\n\\~Roommates.\n\n\\~Nurse and Solider/veteran.\n\n\\~Prince/Princess falls for a village girl/boy.\n\n\\~Friends with benefits\n\n\\~Rich Entrepreneur and interior designer.\n\n\\~Gang member and innocent girl.\n\n\\~Strangers\n\nAnd of course, any other ideas you wish to tell me about. Yes I know these are mildly clich\u00e8, so I\u2019m willing to spice them up and add a lot more angst, or even some dark themes if it does fit with the idea. \n\nSmut will have a very small element in this, but it won't be too overpowering as I want to enjoy the story at its fullest - so it will be discussed fully once the plot has been established and there will always be a good build-up before any NSFW. When it happens though, I'll make sure to attend to your every need.I cannot stress this enough; Please be literate (more than a paragraph at least). If you deliver on that, I will too. Roleplay is a two way mutual thing and it has to flow in order to keep a story going. \n\nThanks for reading! I use kik and reddit DMs. Mainly kik though. If you have any other platform, I\u2019ll be sure to download it if I can!",

I tend to get very emotionally invested in my characters and love writing all sorts of situations for them, so I'm hoping I can find someone just as passionate as myself to RP with!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have a few characters off the bat that I'd have the most ease expanding upon, feel free to check out their profiles here - [**https://toyhou.se/strmct**](https://toyhou.se/strmct)  **please, please,** ***please*** **check these guys out before messaging me**. I have way more luck actually starting RPs with people that know who they wanna write with! They all have purposes and plots - please ask for more info if you have questions!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Themes I wanna do include:** *Fallout NV/3*, Post-Apocalyptic, Fantasy, *maybe* Sci-Fi. In that order! I have very limited experience with Sci-Fi but I'd like to find a patient writing partner to help me try it out.\n\n**Things I'm** ***not*** **interested in:** Strictly romance, strictly adult themes, slice of life, writing first person, fandom rp (aside from things mentioned above), people who are pushy (please don't message me over and over to try to get my attention - it's very offputting!)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can see my **partner criteria** in my profile, but I'll go ahead and post it here as well for ease:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* 18+ partners only! I am uncomfortable with roleplaying with minors. I am comfortable roleplaying adult/dark material but I don\u2019t want that to be the only thing we do! (*Please tell me what you're comfy/not comfy doing!*)\n* I write literate paragraphs in third person. I would really like to write with someone who does the same.\n* You need to bring forth effort into the story; I don't want to just carry the story the entire time.\n* I'm looking for an active, reliable RP partner! If we end up being friends, that's even better.\n* I roleplay through Discord only, usually by making a server for you and I to use privately!\n* I want a collaborative, communicative partner that is willing to work with me rather than give up on a storyline if it goes dull.\n* Please no self-insert characters! I also work best with those who are willing to beef up the environment with NPCs and miscellaneous side characters when necessary.\n* Please don't message me without checking out what I'm interested in/my characters! It's very frustrating to get messages and then we're not compatible bc the person didn't bother to read what I said. :(\n\n===\n\nI think that's about it!

Apocalypse RP: Whether it be Zombie, or Natural Disaster, I'm down for an apocalypse RP.\u00a0 We help each other survive, but there are many twists and turns along the way. Genre: Action/Adventure/Suspense \n\n2. Falling in Love with a mermaid RP: I am royalty amoung the merfolk, a princess, yet I am utterly fascinated with the world above. I steal an amulet from a seawitch that allows me legs on land, but a fin when wet. But when I get to shore, I am captured by the circus. Eventually you come to the circus and try to break me free. Genre: Fantasy/Adventure\n\n3. Superhero falls in love with a civilian RP: You shall play an original superhero in the Marvel Cinematic universe. You save me from a villain and the rest is history. We will experience alot of the plot points from the movies, maybe even working up to infinity war and endgame. Genre: superhero/action \n\n\u00a0I am looking for someone descriptive. I want to make this RP as romantic and dramatic as possible\n\nPlease tell me which prompt interests you and if you have anything you want to add I would love to hear it! If you've messaged me before don't be afraid to message me again. Get my Kik through DM!\n\nI am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+",

            "selftext": "Been a long time since I posted here, but I'm *still* having a hard time finding partners that are genuinely interested in roleplaying and not going ghost after the first day or two....\n\nI'm going to keep this post nice and simple, I'm looking for people who are interested in doing some roleplaying of the fandom variety. OCxCanon to be more precise, like my OCs shipped with canon characters.\n\nReal gender doesn't bother me, so long as you play females characters I'm cool!\n\nDisclaimer: *All* characters will be aged over 18!\n\nAnd I don't care about how much nsfw content we include, so long as it has a presence I don't mind. We can either focus on nsfw themes, or put more time between that stuff. Up to you! Personally I prefer more nsfw themes being involved than most, but I suppose I can't be picky haha!\n\nAnd my replies generally go from two sentences to a paragraph, but so long as you don't expect an essay describing what my character is eating for breakfast... I think we'll get along great! :)\n\nThe main fandoms I'm interested in are Marvel/DC, cause I'm eager to use my OC... Shadow Spider, and ship him with characters like Harley Quinn, Black Cat, Starfire, etc\n\nBut of course, I'm in other fandoms. Far too many to list... so basically, just message me and I'll reply on if I'm in that fandom. If I listed them all I'm afraid I'd just scare people off as it'd just be too much to read.\n\nI can however list popular fandoms that I am NOT part of: Doctor Who and Games of Throne, please don't ask for those. I'm sorry if you like them but I've never watched them\n\nPreferred method is PM or Discord. Message me your preference upon contact! :)",

You can imagine my delight upon discovering Lore Olympus.\n\nLore Olympus has kind of exploded in popularly, and after I *finally* read the first chapter last week...I was hooked! The Gods, the Universe, the Story, the Romance! I'm absolutely head over heels for it. So, it is of no surprise to anyone that I am here searching for someone to explore this universe.\n\nMy hope is to play one of the unmentioned goddesses or mortals to create a delightfully sweet romance of our own. I would love a partner of any gender to play any sort of character they want from God to Goddess to more! If you so desire I would even be happy if you played one of the already established characters ( I mean,come on, you have to love Hermes,right?)\n\nHere's a quick list run down of what I'm hoping for in a partner\n\n* 20+ if possible of any gender! (I'm 27, and it's nice to have someone closer to my age to write with.)\n* Detailed, Multi-Para Posts (I love being captivated by words, falling deeply into a story. Not every post has to be a novel, but I like hearing about the little things.)\n* Playing through Discord of Google Docs (Let's look back on our hard work!)\n* Someone willing to swap music playlists, indulge in character mood boards, and more! Let's get attached to our characters together.\n* Let's be friends! If we're role playing together we obviously have something in common. We should be able to speak comfortably out of character.\n* Most important? Accept that I am a hopeless romantic. I like the sappiness of it all, and I hope that you will too. Some call it cheesy but I call it sweet.\n\nIf any of these sounds like you...hit me with a PM! Let's see what sort of Olympus love story we can create!",

I\u2019m hoping to find a long-term role-play partner, that will, in their free time, indulge in descriptive, literate storytelling surrounding an interesting, male/female love story that we can come up with together. I wish to have a partner that can spell correctly, use correct grammar (not that I\u2019m perfect all the time), as well as punctuation, capitalization, and be admirably descriptive in their writing. I don\u2019t exactly desire extreme novels to be sent back, and forth, just messages containing enough effort of description so we, each-other, can really understand, see, hear, and feel what\u2019s going on for our characters in the role-play. A lot of the time, I set up a role-play with somebody, and get so excited, because they seem super literate, and descriptive, and passionate about what they write, but then they shock me with one, little paragraph replies. I hope I don\u2019t seem too picky or anything, because I certainly don\u2019t nag anybody for writing mistakes, but I just want to receive the same amount of effort that I put into the story. \ud83d\ude42 I\u2019m also looking for somebody who prefers a build-up to NSFW. If there\u2019s no build-up, it has to at least contribute, and make sense with the story, which I wouldn\u2019t mind at all!\n\nI do have a list of role ideas, if you\u2019d like to have a look at it, as I would be willing to hear any of your ideas, as well! I\u2019m open-minded, and I hope you\u2019ll be, too. I seek honesty, and communication between me and my role-play partner, yet as for general communication and conversation apart from the rp, I\u2019m not MUCH of a talker. Of course, I won\u2019t ignore you OOC, I just have my intentions set more on the role-play, and getting to know your writing skills, rather. \ud83d\ude0a Hope that\u2019s okay! \n\nI do Discord only! If you\u2019re interested, please send a message my way, and please include your Discord username. It would also be a bonus if I saw a writing sample of yours! I like to check if my potential rp partner\u2019s writing style clashes with mine well. Hope to hear from you. \ud83e\udd29",

My preferred pairing (at least for my main character) will be MxF though I am open to other pairings with other characters as well. \n\nI play over email, Discord, and GDocs. \n\nIf you're interested, PM me and maybe we can get something going. I wouldn't mind receiving a writing sample and I'm happy to return one, too.  I've got a few generalized ideas for some of the aforementioned genres, so be prepared to plot with me and expand on broad plotters!",

Whether it be from just little hints of darker elements, to a truly dark Roleplay with questionable elements. So I\u2019m here to try again.\n\nWhat I look for in a partner:\n\nSomewhat Availability - I expect at least a post a day, but then yet again I understand life gets in the way, or discord just doesn\u2019t work properly and the response gets lost. I just ask you always double check or at least tell me when the response is going to be a while.\n\nLiteracy - I expect those who are willing to write a lot for their responses. I can write from 1 paragraph to 8, depending on the scenario, I expect somewhat of that. I don\u2019t want one-liners, or crappy paragraphs, effort comes a long way in my opinion.\n\nCharacters/Genres - In my opinion I hold my characters very close to my heart and will ask that my characters are never in your control, (as in you are writing their actions/reactions). That goes the same with me as I will never control your characters. Genres I\u2019m pretty open to except post Apoc, it just has never really worked out for me. \n\nCURRENT IDEAS: \n\nCurrently I have a couple ideas in the works, Superhero/SuperVillain romance, as well as a couple others that we can discuss once I get a couple responses. If you put your discord into the response I\u2019ll probably respond a tad quicker than average. \n\nI hope you all have a fantastic day, and thank you for reading!",

            "selftext": " \n\nGood morning to all you role-players and writers out there, thanks for stopping by!\n\nI\u2019m looking for a laid back, fun, and creative partner who prefers writing in the third person, can post between one to two paragraphs, and be able to keep the flow of the story and scene from coming to a standstill. I\u2019m a huge fan of getting to know my partners and talking things through before starting a roleplay, so if that doesn\u2019t appeal to you, you may want to stop here. I\u2019m also a very visual person and I love to share pictures of potential character references, outfit options, even pictures of settings like apartments or houses and hope you do too! I want to form a creative partnership with you where we can freely discuss our thoughts, ideas, and translate them into engaging and exciting stories. At this time, I\u2019m only looking to roleplay through Discord and am not interested in joining any group roleplays.\n\nAs the title suggests, I\u2019m looking for the focus of this roleplay to revolve around romance. Does this mean that this is the only thing we\u2019ll be focusing on? Heck no! I love adding in elements of action, angst, drama, and yes, NSFW when the story allows for it. I\u2019m looking to play a woman in her mid-twenties that\u2019s just about to start her career, and maybe a new relationship as well! The only thing is, she has been straight her entire life, and for some reason maybe she decides to date women. Did she have a traumatic break-up with a man that lead to swearing them off temporarily? Or maybe your character has had a crush on mine for quite some time now and she finally gives into your advances? Are we new co-workers that end up spending much more of our free time together than we ever thought we would? Or maybe you have some dirt on my character and use it to blackmail my character? These are just a few ideas floating around in my head, none of them are set in stone! What I do know is that I want this to be complicated. What do I mean by that? Well life and relationships aren't always a walk in the park, and I don\u2019t want this roleplay to be the exception! Maybe our character\u2019s relationship causes issues at work, with family, friends, or maybe even spurs on the return of one of our exes? I'd like my character to struggle with coming out as well, to her friends, family, and her work and how that may affect the other relationships in her life. Again, just a few examples of what we could use, not what we have to!\n\nAs for a setting, I\u2019m leaning more towards something modern, maybe with a hint of fantasy thrown in with it if we wanted? I\u2019m a huge Marvel fan, so involving superpowers is almost always something I\u2019m interested in. On the flip side, I\u2019m totally fine with a more realistic take on things, maybe even having one, or both, of our characters being in law enforcement? Maybe we get partnered up as detectives? I\u2019m purposely leaving this ad a little open ended because I want to work with you to create this. I don\u2019t want to use all my ideas and suggestions, I want this to be something we\u2019re both going to enjoy, and both contribute towards, so please I\u2019d absolutely love to hear your ideas and thoughts!\n\nWell that about wraps up my ad, thank you so much for stopping by and reading this far, I really appreciate it! If you have any questions or are interested in this, feel free to send me a private message! Please don\u2019t send me a chat request via Reddit, I\u2019m not a fan of communicating through that and like to feel people out a bit through PMs before giving out my Discord. Hope to hear from some of you soon, have a wonderful day!",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone, I am on the hunt for a few more roleplays! I have a few ideas in mind which I will list down below.\n\nBut, first things first, here's some info about me and how I write/what I look for in a partner:\n\n* I'm looking for multi-paragraph novel style. Currently I can post 1 time a day to every other day, usually in the evenings as I do have a full time job. Sometimes I can write more than that, just depends on my schedule.\n\n* I put 21+ because I am well into my 20s and writing with someone younger is awkward to be honest. I do enjoy having NSFW themes and yes, some smut, so this is non-negotiable!\n\n* Please use proper grammar and spelling. At least know the difference between your and you're, then and than and etc.\n\n* Currently only interested in MxF. There has to be some element of \"romance\"\n\n* I don't necessarily think post-length is the be all end all, but I would say on average I write about 250-450 words a post. Honestly, I will probably get bored if replies are a paragraph or less. A reply with a couple of lines will basically guarantee my leaving the RP, just not for me, sorry!\n\n* Lastly, I really like working with my partner to have lots of twists and turns in the story. So please enjoy a nice amount of OOC chats to plan and plot. I also like pictures if you're into that.\n\nNote: Please don't suggest that we play \"ourselves\" or get confused with me vs my character. I write novel-esque stories with characters, not myself. I will not ever write in 1st person.\n\nOkay, so here's my ideas:\n\n1. A slice of life character driven rp. Something summery and fun, but with drama and twists/turns. One thing I would be into is  farm/ranch setting, my character a ranch hand, yours a city girl? Alternatively, something in the vein of Knocked Up. Or whatever else you can think of, I'm always open to discuss. \n\n2. Apocalypse. I'd like to set an apocalypse story on a desolate farm where my character is living with family/friends. Your character comes to the farm somehow as a newcomer, they have to gain each other's trust. Character-driven apocalypse story. Looking to play the female role. (no zombies please!)\n\n3. Werewolfxhuman. A human girls moves to a small town and meets a mysterious man and his extended family. Little does she know that she's just walked into a wolf's den. Looking to play the male werewolf.\n\nIf you're interested please PM me! I don't really respond to messages that just say \"hey\" or \"wanna rp?\" So, if you do reach out, please tell me a bit about yourself and about the plot you'd like to play! Thanks!",

            "selftext": "Hey there people! To start off, I write in third person and past tense and would like my partner to do the same. My length is usually 1-2 paragraphs, depending on how the scene is going; sometimes things stay short for a bit especially when lots of back and forth dialogue is happening, and some get longer than normal. It's all good.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, on to the actual idea; as the title makes clear, it revolves around a fairy. I'm keeping it somewhat simple and a little vague on specifics because we can always tweak things and add things. Also, I'm fine with playing either role for this!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasically, in a normal, modern, magicless (or at least seemingly so) world, one woman stumbles upon a bottle with an odd soft light in it, discovering an unconscious, trapped fairy inside that is stuck in a ditch, river, or something similar. After saving her, the fairy would agree to be her companion for a while in thanks, offering her services - namely, her magic. It would practically be like a genie, though probably more limited so things like wishing for godhood or the ability to do grant one's own wishes would be out of the question, things like that. This obviously can go a lot of ways, and we can discuss that plenty! I'm fine with it staying more casual slice of life with them just messing around with the magic, or putting in something more by leading it into the discovering of more magic, creatures, and fantastical things with a bigger plot they get drawn into.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs mentioned in the title, I use Discord, so message me and we can get to it.",

            "selftext": "Hey all, so my inbox cleared up again. As I get use to searching for partners here I feel like I know what I need to specify. If you read this and are still curious or have questions please do not be afraid to ask. Let us begin. \n\n\n\n*First and foremost what I\u2019m looking for in a partner:*\n\n-Posts at least once a week but once a month will also work if you have a lot going on and are able to keep me in the loop. THOUGH please note that i check in after a week to see if your okay and still want to Rp and after a month I delete the server. I\u2019ve had people string me along or ignore me and it\u2019s not fun. I am looking for consistency and you\u2019re not up for that one I\u2019m not your girl. \n\n-I shall repeat, keep me in the loop! I don\u2019t mind asking but I will only ask once, where have you been, before I delete/leave the server. Everyone has a life and other very important things to do I get that so please just let me know. \n\n-respect my needs. I\u2019ve been doing this since I was 13 so please understand that I have a style and a form of writing. If I feel that our styles will not mesh I will be asking you to change or it\u2019s not going to work. I know it\u2019s kind of rough to say that but I rp because it\u2019s fun, and having to decipher someone else writing or having myself pulled out of the story because our styles don\u2019t work together just isn\u2019t what I want. Also if you don\u2019t given me enough to work with or your post does nothing to move the plot forward I will stop the Rp as well. \n\n-Let me know of concerns or problems. Every Rp I do has an OOC channel for that very reason. Voice your concerns please. \n\n-understand that I have a rather hectic life. And posting everyday sometimes just isn\u2019t possible. I post a minimal of three times a week when my schedule is light but that can reduce to once a week if things get really crazy. \n\n\n\n*What I\u2019m looking for in my Rp*\n\n-grammar doesn\u2019t have to be perfect and neither does spelling. As long as I can read it we should be fine. \n\n-I have no post length. But I need enough to work with. One liners don\u2019t just magically work all the time. PLUS it NEEDS to move the story forward. Do not have me sitting on a couch for two responses because your posts are doing nothing to push the story along. \n\n-details are my crack so please be descriptive as possible.\n\n-romance, adventure and drama are all musts. \n\n-I don\u2019t do show characters or anything like that, originals only. Setting are alright though. Like the fallout universe for example works for me. \n\n-Currently I do have some plots of Rps that have fizzled out lately and have stayed with me so please ask if you want to hear them. I only Rp on discord so pm me and I\u2019ll give you that do we can chat! \n\nThank you for your time!!",

            "selftext": " Stories of Gotham is a DC Comics roleplay server centred about Batman Year Two with some custom lore to make the character pool wider. We are all longform writers here and ask that you are too! On Stories of Gotham we are exploring the chapters in Gotham's history and character's over time. As the RP moves, slowly time will move too as we progress through the years of Batman's career and begin to delve into iconic moments such as Killing Joke.     \n\n\nAt Stories of Gotham we ask our writers try out two characters, a hero and villain so that we can have a wider character pool and also to prevent dreaded RP locking. Though we understand if they only want to write one. Character applications are done through a sample system that staff can happily provide prompts for.     \n\n\nWe are relatively new so many roles are open for the taking if you're interested! We hope to see **YOU** join and help tell the many stories of Gotham City alongside us. Whether your chosen character is fighting on the streets of Gotham or gliding through the skylines, you'll be welcome here at Stories of Gotham with open arms.   \n\n\n[https://discord.gg/Nz5p32](https://discord.gg/Nz5p32)",

Sorry!\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0Must be able to reply at least a few times each week. I don't need you to tell me your schedule or when you're going somewhere, but just need you to be able to commit to the movement of the story.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0Must be literate! I don't need every reply to have multiple paragraphs (not that I don't love it) but I do expect correct grammar and at least a few sentences.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0Must be nice! We don't have to be friends, but I am chatty soo...\n\n\ud83d\udcf7If we are going to be doing a Fandom story, please be upfront in telling me how complete your knowledge is of the subject. I like to be sort of detail oriented.\n\n**Guidelines :**\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0Off the bat, I don't play straight guys in romantic situations. The only time I will play a straight guy is if the character is fully needed, or romance isn't involved. Every time I try to play one, they turn into a jerk.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0Playing more than one character is fine. I will also double up if you want me to play a certain character, as long as I think I can play them.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0I love romance. I just do, I'm sappy like that. This being said, I don't like stories where they just automatically are in love. This has a few exceptions, but most likely won't happen unless the story idea is really good.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0I'm also interested in like family style stories, as far as non-romance goes.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0I like to add real life themes into my stories. This is one, because I like drama, and two, because perfect stories in perfect worlds are no fun.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0My only triggers are only triggers when portrayed incorrectly. These are mental health issues, invisible diseases, and suicide. I will call you out on these things and stop the story if they are misrepresented.

            "selftext": "Hello! I\u2019m (a woman) from the USA and in my late twenties. I have about seven years of role playing experience. I\u2019m in the process of watching the series for the third time, and so in love with Good Omens that I\u2019m looking for a role play. :)\n\n\nI\u2019d like to play Aziraphale, but you might convince me to play Crowley. I haven\u2019t read the book yet (though I plan on it!) so my depiction will be based on the show. For this to work, you\u2019ll need to have seen the show, too.  \n\n\nIn terms of Aziraphale and Crowley\u2019s relationship and the story we\u2019ll be creating together, I\u2019m open to different scenarios. Their relationship can be based on what they would do or say in the show, or they might openly admit their love for one another. It can be fluffy or rather serious or somewhere in between. \n\n\n**This must be SFW**, or safe for work. I might be fine with a mature plot point, **if it\u2019s written completely metaphorically, beautifully, and has to do with emotions rather than anything explicit**. \n\n\nBecause the subject matter is romantic I ask that you only respond to this if you are aged 23+.\n\n\nI don\u2019t know what to specify for preferred content length. The most important thing is that we\u2019re enjoying one another\u2019s writing. If you feel like you can portray your character accurately and imaginatively I\u2019ll be happy, so a minimum of a 1-2 paragraphs (of about 3-4 sentences) per reply and I\u2019ll occasionally be fine with a clever one liner. \n\n\nPlease only respond if you write well enough to help carry a story and play your character convincingly. Occasional mistakes or typos are completely fine. \n\n\nMy output will depend on the particular role play\u2019s scenario and the length of our replies. If I\u2019m Crowley, my responses will probably be shorter than if I\u2019m playing Aziraphale. My replies could be multiple a day to once a day, depending on how much we\u2019re writing. \n\n\nAnother consideration is that I will immediately lose interest at Godmodding. You will control your character and I will control my own (please and thank you :)).\n\nI have some ideas for plots.\n\n-Our pair can meet up at a carnival, amusement park, or the beach located near some delicious restaurants.\n\n-Our pair can meet at Aziraphale\u2019s bookshop and spend the day together, maybe going for a stroll, and/or going out to eat, stay in for some wine, drink after dinner, or any other scenario or combination of events. \n\n-Maybe we can have some flashbacks to earlier time periods. \n\n-Must be summer time! :)\n\nI\u2019d like to hear any ideas you may have, too.\n\nOoc (out of character) chatting is preferred and lovely, but not required. \n\nIf this description of a role play appeals to you, then please send me a private message introducing yourself a little, your preferred character, and what sort of plot you\u2019re thinking about. I\u2019d love it if you titled the message with a favorite GO quote. \n\nIf we aren\u2019t a good fit I\u2019ll be honest. I hope there\u2019s no hard feelings. \n\nThanks for reading! :D",

I now know that of anything else, everything that happened and all that I saw, the things I had to do and had never thought to do before, besides*** ***all*** ***of that...it was those eyes. They were blue, bright and clear, piercing and vital like manna in the desert or the truest shade of what you think that Great Ocean looks like. Yet there was a heavy dark behind them, a great and terrible vastness that threatened to swallow up that visage and you both, take you down under and drown you forevermore in the suffocating smell of grave-dust and long walks best left forgotten. I've never been so scared of someones eyes in my whole life, but in that moment I had just an ounce of courage left, so I stopped the Stranger before it all changed and I had to ask their name. Now? I'm still not sure if the answer or the smile that came after is what surprised me more...\"***\n\nI hope you enjoyed that! Does it have a point, a purpose, a place or rhyme and reason in this big ordered world we try so hard to make for ourselves from the seemingly unseemly chaos of existence? Nope! Its like me. Maybe you liked those words, and if so, you may just yet like me.\n\nThis will be my second proper posting for RP and stories, and I'm hoping it'll catch your interest. Drum roll please! *\\*Badumtsisisisisisisisisisis\\**\n\n**Now (re)introducing...Me!**\n\nThank you magical drums. Anyhow, I've been typing and writing stories ever since I was eighteen, and before that too. Does that make me the most discerning and influential novelist of the century? Of course not! Do I desire that? Nope! All I want to do is make good stories, have fun, and write with people who want to write with me. I like **depth** because I give depth to my typing. I want a good grasp of **vocabulary** because I possess the same. I can do **long term**, **short term**, any term because variety is the spice of life. The same applies to characters, I can play **females**, **males**, **robots**, **aliens**, **monsters**, **minor** and **major** characters as needed or desired. Not to mention that I'm fairly flexible with both **1st Person**and **3rd Person** POV's!\n\nGenres I usually do and have quite some degree of experience with are **Medieval** (With and without **Fantasy** elements, always **Non-historic**), **Sci-Fi**, **Slice of Life**, **Post-Apoc**, and a variety of other things I dabble in. If you don't see it listed, ask! My joy is, and may always be, in giving my partner joy. If you are happy (and if I'm not suffering for it), then I am happy.\n\nI usually play and write on **Discord** or **Google Docs**, but I do have a **Kik,** and access to the ever-so-lovely internet to pick up modes and mediums for typing as needed. In addition to an enjoyment in **story development** and **world building**, I love **character progression**, I enjoy **romance** and all the more intimate details that would contain (hence that **NSFW** tag). I've done my fair share of making up the plots and stories (so I do have some threads and starting ideas), as well as following other ideas and threads, but I have found that co-op work on a shared adventure or setting is always my strongest area to play in. If you should message me and we make a story together, you'll come to see I can very cooperative and competent. As long as you are happy, I am happy.\n\nSo! Send me some messages! I'll be waiting.\n\n(PS. Just as its happened to me, and maybe you as well, I won't just ignore you or drop off. I will tell you if something comes up in my life, and I'll be patient with your own as well. If we don't work out well, I'll talk about it, we can try and figure something out. And even if it doesn't lead to us partnering up, I'm still happy we had a chance to speak. Have a nice day!)\n\n(PSS Please use the **Message** function to reach me, as if I am out and about with just my phone, the **Chat** function may or may not be reliable! **Messages** are more reliable!)",

I\u2019m going back to the field house and need something to entertain myself, so here goes.\n\nA modern fantasy story is what I\u2019m currently hung up on, looking for someone who can play a whole range of characters. \n\nThe basic plot I want to mess with is that one of our characters is a famous researcher, whose life\u2019s work has been disproving the claims of the paranormal. They are meticulous, their methods well-designed,  and as far as skeptics go, they\u2019re the top tier. People from all over the world come to your character, looking to prove him/her wrong. \n\nAnd then, someone comes along with a claim that sounds benign at first. Maybe they\u2019re claiming they have an unruly spirit, or the faeries are stealing their garden vegetables. As usual, this character packs up the appropriate gear and heads out.\n\nWhat happens next is up to us. I can\u2019t wait to see where we take it!\n\nOther starter ideas I'm looking to play include:\n\n1.\tA medieval fantasy story that's more political than magical, because political dramas are my favorite. Evil queen looking for the fountain of youth, or a rogue warrior trying to regain her honor? Yes please.\n\n2. Modern witches being hunted by witch hunters even though magic is protected by law\n\n3. Anything in which mythology comes up. Extra points if you let me use some of the Aztec mythology I love so much.\n\nThis isn\u2019t an exhaustive list, if you have an idea, I want to hear it! \n\nThe only fandoms I care to write at this time are Dragon Age and Mass Effect. I love canon characters, OCs, the works, just let me know! \n\n\nI use Discord now because it's  awesome and I  like being able to have  separate threads for different  conversations, but I am also willing to use Skype . \n\nI  am a character-making  fool, so if you like to have  four or five  characters, let me know! \n\nMy posts range  from two paragraphs to two pages depending on what feels   right, but if  you give me a lot, I'll do my best to match your pacing. \n\n I also really  like multiple posts a day, whenever possible, and tend  to try to reply  as quickly as I can to keep things moving.\n\nWe can discuss limits and all that when we're chatting. Please be over 18!",

            "selftext": "Hey there, I'm currently looking for someone to GM a one-on-one RP. I have an idea in mind for each of the fandoms I've listed, but I'm open to whatever suggestions you may have.\r\n\r\n**I want you to be the GM. That means you would control the world, NPCs, events, and the outcome of my actions, while I simply control my character.**\r\n\r\nIf any of the ideas below strike your interest, please shoot me a message.\r\n\r\nDo note, all the ideas below are just that: ideas. If you've got a different idea for one of the fandoms I'm looking for, I'm always ready to hear it.\r\n\r\n**Haruhi Suzumiya**\r\n\r\nCraving this one the most. My idea is for the RP to be set either during, after, or before the events of the anime. My character would be a time-traveller who travels back in time to escape from a dystopian future and ends up enrolling in the same school as Haruhi (could be middle-school, high school, or university, depending on when you want the RP to take place). I'm also open to the RP taking place in the Disappearance Universe, or a Universe entirely separate from anything in the anime or manga.\r\n\r\n**KonoSuba**\r\n\r\nMy character would be a member of the Adventurer Guild in the world of KonoSuba, though he could either be a native there or end up there like Kazuma. The RP could be entirely OCs or have canon characters, though I'd prefer canon characters to be in it, whether on their own or with OCs sprinkled in (especially since I'm absolutely in love with Megumin).\r\n\r\nI do have one idea for the story that's pretty far detached from the story and structure of the show. My character would be a native to the world, or at least someone who's been there a long time. He'd be a monster hunter who runs a restaurant. He goes out and hunts monsters solely to supply meat for the restaurant. It'd be a mix of a restaurant management type of thing, as well as having a lot of monster hunting. He could also take on quests for people, in exchange for getting to hire them as employees (either working as party members or in the restaurant). There could even be sections where he travels to other places to set up more restaurants or to hunt exotic monsters.\r\n\r\nOf course, if you aren't a fan of that, we could have the more standard fare of an adventurer and his party taking on quests and exploring the world. In that case, it might be more interesting to give the entire RP a road trip vibe, instead of having it take place around a central hub\r\n\r\n\r\n**Dragon Ball**\r\n\r\nIn the far-future of the main series (or in an alternate universe), the dragon balls become closely guarded to prevent anyone unworthy from making wishes. Each of the dragon balls is held by a Keeper. Every ten years, the Keepers set up a world-spanning event, where everyone is invited to participate. All participants gather at one place, at which point the locations of all seven Keepers is revealed to them. From then on, it's a race to not only reach the various Keepers, but to pass their tests in order to obtain their dragon balls. Once all the dragon balls are taken from their Keepers, the location of a hidden shrine is revealed to everyone who has at least one of the dragon balls. The dragon balls only work when gathered together at this shrine, drawing all the holders to one spot for a final battle.\r\n\r\nI think this idea would be great in terms of character development. All characters would be working towards the goal of having their one wish granted while on a long journey, giving them plenty of time to develop. I'm thinking that before the race begins, some time can be spent showing the main characters training for it. Maybe they're training together, or maybe they're miles apart and only meet for the first time at the starting point of the race.\r\n\r\nOne alternative that I really like is instead of having it be a race, make it something more akin to a pilgrimage. People must still pass the tests of the Keepers, but they do it at their own pace, and whenever they feel ready. You're not allowed to take the Dragon Balls until you pass all the tests, and not everyone will be going after them at the same time. It'll give everything a bit of a slower pace, and allow for more time to be spent on character development and maybe a bit of slice-of-life stuff.\r\n\r\n**Kingdom Hearts**\r\n\r\nMy idea for this RP is to play as an amnesiac Keyblade-wielding Nobody. He cannot remember anything at all, not his past when he was a whole person, nor the reason he became a Nobody in the first place. His only clue is the fact that he has two Keyblades, one of which he can feel isn't his. The RP would be his journey as he tries to regain his heart and his memories. It could take place either during, before, or after the games, or even take place in an alternate timeline/universe.\r\n\r\nThere could, of course, also be a central villain of the story. Perhaps the villain (or maybe even a group of villains) had some role in my character becoming a Nobody, and through conflict with them, my character comes closer and closer to finding the truth.\r\n\r\n**Touhou**\r\n\r\nWould love an RP set in the wonderful world of Gensokyo! I was thinking my character would be from the Outside World who ends up in Gensokyo during the start of the RP or beforehand. From there, he'd slowly start to explore the world and meet the various characters in it. Maybe there's an incident going on, or maybe he's in Gensokyo during the events of one of the games. In any case, this is one we could definitely discuss further.\r\n\r\n**Star Wars**\r\n\r\nThis RP could be set before, during, or after any of the films, or in an alternate Universe. My character would be a Mandalorian who left his home planet to work as a bounty hunter while trying to find his lost sister. However, several years have passed since he started, with no luck at all. He's given up hope at this point, and may have already lost sight of the beloved sibling he was trying to find in the first place. He seems completely without purpose in the Universe, even though he's well-known for his skill in his profession.\r\n\r\nHis story would be one of regaining his purpose and remembering once again why he's so far from home. Perhaps this story is one driven by him learning of and achieving balance in the Force. Or, perhaps his story remains outside of the Force, with him driving his own, uninfluenced path. I think, in either case, he should end up dragged into the Sith/Jedi conflict through one way or another. \r\n\r\n**Marvel**\r\n\r\nI'm a big fan of the MCU films and have been pretty interested in an RP related to Marvel. Doesn't necessarily have to be set in the MCU, and I'd probably actually prefer an alternate Universe so we have a bit more free-reign with what we want to do with the characters and world. I was thinking that the RP would begin with an origin story for my character, with him either facing a canonical villain or an original character. After that point, the Universe could open up and include more of the heroes from Marvel. It doesn't necessarily have to immediately go into something like the Avengers where everyone comes together to fight a big threat, but maybe the heroes could be slowly introduced one at a time into the story.\r\n\r\nIt could also take place some time after Endgame, maybe with the current Avengers keeping on the lookout for someone else who could fill out their ranks, and eventually stumbling upon my character.\r\n\r\nMy idea for a character is a discharged war veteran who, during combat, discovered his ability to decelerate time (to an extent) for both living and non-living things. He's the owner, proprietor, and sole employee of a quiet bar, loved by its regulars for the way time just seems to slow down whenever they step in and grab a seat.",

Not too picky on whether it's an Autobot or not but I'm CRAVING the interaction between the two different species. (You could say I adored the recent Bumblebee movie.) \n\nI will be playing the human OC so I'm looking for someone playing a Transformer for me. \n\nIt's been a while since I've caught up on TF lore but I do know the bare basics of everything and I'm willing to learn from the vets out there! \n\nIf you have any questions or are interested please send a DM, thanks!",

            "selftext": " \n\nHello!\n\nI'm currently looking for a dark/modern fantasy Overwatch roleplay based on one of my favorite AUs, Demon verse. This is largely inspired by the popular 2Demons AU from artist Karina Farek ( [https://dilfosaur.tumblr.com/tagged/2demons-au](https://dilfosaur.tumblr.com/tagged/2demons-au)) which is an amazing comics series she's doing and I would highly recommend it.\n\nAt the end of the day though, I would love to play Hanzo (as an Oni) and am looking for someone to play him opposite. Mccree is always lovely of course, but I am open to other characters or OCs. The storyline I would likely want to follow is Hanzo wandering around, and eventually he finds someone like him, haunted and broken, and they form a relationship as ghosts from the past show up and screw things up.\n\nIf playing a fandom roleplay is a turn off, I do have an oni OC I would also be interested in writing a similar writing arc for, if you are interested in that. \n\nThe roleplay would follow an arc of looking for happiness and redemption among a seemingly desolate setting of seeing the worst that humanity has to offer, and raising the question of who is worse, humans or demons? Or are demons just what happens when humanity's darker impulses take over? Either way, I'd like to go into complex moral situations and past issues a lot, which would serve to drive the RP plot.\n\nAs for partners, I'm looking for someone who can write a few paragraphs per response, and who can respond a few times on a good day. I'm looking for 18+ exclusively, because of content and the like. I'm also looking for someone who writes in third person and who can come to me with ideas on how to make things interesting.\n\nAnyway thank you for reading my gay screeching, if you're interested, hit me up with a PM and maybe we can talk on Discord!",

To make this post short and sweet, I'll just make a list of things which should make it easier for people to see what I like.\n\nGenres I like: Medieval, Tribal, Post Apoc, Dark, Gritty, Horror, Low Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Pirates, Western, Superheroes, Grim-Dark (pretty much every NSFW tag), Greek, Roman, some Fandoms (Fallout, Elder Scrolls, FNAF, Warframe, Game Of Thrones, Star Wars, and Alien Vs Predator are some which quickly come to mind, admittedly, there is a lot which I like, but these are the main few).\n\nWhat I hope (though am not limited to) to do RP wise however, is play a character in someone's world, basically exploring about and doing stories whenever the character stumbles upon them or happens to fall into one. A GM/DM is who I am primarily looking for as a partner (BUT not required!). And hopefully one who has no limits, like me. And yes, I'm fine with playing female characters too.\n\nIn terms of RP, I have no limits, so any story can go with me or anything can happen in RP and i'm fine with it.\n\nSo if you're interested in a partner with no limits, i'm up for it!\n\nIf you want to ask anything, make sure of anything or anything of the like, feel free to message me or talk with me using the Reddit chat system.\n\nThough please, don't just remove me while we're setting things up or whatever else. If you have the urge, please tell me why so we can work on it or so that I'd at least be aware. :)\n\nThanks for reading!",

I like Warcraft and GOT universes a lot so, those two are my main preferences to go with. Of course we work on details, not everything must be canon. Also I might be up for creating an alternative universe for those characters too. There are many pairings and characters that I like for a GOT roleplay though I'm more willing to go with OCs in this universe. \n\nPurely independent roleplays are fine too, tell me your ideas and we can talk further. Recently I've seen (even if I'm quite late) Critical Role's RPG Show and I really liked it! I'm not experienced with DnD but other than that I have no hesitation to  go with some DnD style thing.\n\nI love slow-burns, romance and smut are appreciated on that term. MxM and FxF pairings would be my first preference unless I would state otherwise. (*cough* see that Maiev x Illidan above *cough*) I'm up for other themes as well, my only limitation would be really depressing, heavy scenarios. I don't mean I'm against dark twists or anything when it fits but I wouldn't enjoy something fully based on a depressive, victim-POV scenario etc.\n\nI'm a young adult so I would feel comfortable to have someone who is a young adult as well. I'm hoping to reply at least once a day normally on discord and I expect the same but if you get busy or need a break more than a few days, it's alright as long as you tell me. I would do the same, I think the communication is the key. Also English is not my main language, especially a native speaker would feel it. If that's fine, feel free to message me with your interests, preferences and ideas. Have a nice day!",

I write at least 5 sentences, but I tend to match your replies. The more you give me to work with, the better my responses will be. Please have solid grammar, spelling, and punctuation. As long as you don't seem like you're 14, you're good.\n\nMy prompt:\n\nThe Imperial Legion and the Stormcloak Rebellion conflict has been going on for decades now. New commanders and leaders have been put in place and territory has been stolen back and forth to no avail. With the fabled Dragonborn now dead and just a fabled hero, there\u2019s no one to help put an end to the terror.\n\nCalvalius \u201cCalvin\u201d Vix is a mercenary swordsman who is often hired by anyone with the coin to afford his services. \\[Your character\\], a young lady who is a skilled archer, have been arrested for treason against the Empire. As you are brought to Solitude, you escape to Markarth and hire me for protection as we begin a long journey together.\n\nWe team up and accomplish multiple goals, help each other out, and end up dating as romantic feelings develop. But things don\u2019t stay peachy for us forever. Our bounty has racked up a huge amount of coin and now we must travel from Markarth to Riften to seek safety with the Thieves Guild. Our journey will not be an easy one.\n\nIf you're interested, shoot me a PM! I honestly have no issue with tweaking my prompt or even coming up with a new one. I don't bite!",

It's why I can write to what I humbly believe to be at least a **somewhat decent** level. Being able to write every single day for months on end for more years of my life than not has given me invaluable experience in character creation, development, world building, narrative, all of it.\n\n**\u2661** I mention this because I would very much prefer it if you are also on the more **advanced literate** side of literate in your writing. I ask that you are fairly experienced, with a firm grasp of spelling, grammar, and storytelling. I **don't** ask that you be perfect, I am a **better storyteller** than I am at grammar and punctuation and all that, tbh and as a warning. I'm gonna make glaring mistakes because the words were just rushing out too fast and I was blinded by the vision of the scene and the things I was trying to convey, but I do try my best.\n\nAll that to say again, we're both human, perfection isn't being sought here, but just write good, k?\n\n**\u2661** **I prefer female writing partners.** NB and trans individuals **of course** also welcome. Basically, as long as you weren't socialized as male, we'll likely get along. And I actually get along great with bi men as well, so you're welcome also. I'm sure that's putting all the str8 cis-dudes reading this right into their feelings, and that's fine, I get it, but this is my preference. I don't care to hear your thoughts on it. The answer is \"No, thank you.\" But best of luck to you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- **TLDR: If you're not a straight dude and you want to write the male roles in our stories, and enjoy those roles, PM me!**\n\n(Oh, the downvotes, they are coming.  \ud83d\ude02 )\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\u2661** I do **only** play female main characters, and I understand if that is frustrating to you, but that is also my preference. If you don't enjoy playing the main male roles, **do not PM me**. I'm not about asking anyone to do anything they don't want to do. If you don't want to...please don't.\n\n**\u2661** I type much more **casually** in direct conversation via IM/DM, I **overshare** and brainstorm ideas constantly and will flood your messages if you're away with them.\n\n**\u2661** I am **only** interested in **hetero romance** pairings. I know, ew, str8 ppl. But the heart wants what it wants, as we all know.\n\n**\u2661** I prefer **GDocs/E-mail** for the actual writing and **Discord** for ooc chatter and brainstorming. I will bow to pressure if you ONLY use discord servers and you seem like a good potential partner, but I **don't** love the character limit on there.\n\n**\u2661** I **\\*really\\*** am not comfortable working with anyone younger than around **\\~22+** Like, I have **zero** interest and it'll be a flat **no** from me. Sorry.\n\n**\u2661** I don't know if this is a given, but I also ask that you **help** me populate the **side-characters** as needed for our world and our stories.\n\n**\u2661** I **do not** match **post length** just for the sake of it. I will always try and give as much as I possibly can in a post, but if we need to advance forward, or the post for whatever reason didn't give me a ton to work with or it's mainly dialogue, my reply will be shorter.\n\n**\u2661** **I do not like pre-made characters**. I expect that **all** characters used in our stories are made expressly for those stories.\n\n**\u2661** I write in **third person past-tense POV only**.\n\n**\u2661** I **only** use actors and models for **character references**, and I consider character references **necessary**.\n\n\u2661 I do **not** have many limits for adult themes and I do **not** fade to black but there must be a balance between those themes and storytelling, tipped in the favor of good, amazing storytelling and all the drama and pain of whatever situation plagues our characters. Please include your **NSFW** preferences in your introductory PM. **\u2661**\n\n**\u2661** SO yeah, just to make it a bullet point, I prefer **long-term** writing partners. We can certainly do **one-offs** for cravings, and leave and come back to stories and worlds and plots as we please, we are after all in charge, but I prefer to have one or two steady people I can turn to when I want to work on something either creatively for a few months or to satisfy a craving in the moment that may or may not turn into something long-term we work on or come back to, and to be that person for someone else as well.\n\n**\u2661** **Please don't invite me to your group role-plays**. \u2661 Thanks so much for the thought and I am flattered but I am only interested in one on one stuff for now. The most I would consider is maybe occasionally working together with a third party if you wanted to bring one in on discord someday or something like that. That could be fun, but I don't do group stuff.\n\n**\u2661** I **don't** tend to like playing **canon characters**. I will take ideas from characters and build something new around that, something similar, but still mine. I will also do this with settings, worlds, drawing from TV and movies and comics and books, etc. But I will never play a canon character and for me to play opposite one, as in you playing a canon character, would have to be a huge crave or a lot of convincing and pretense and plot that I like. It's rare, but not 100% unprecedented. (I would have murdered someone for a Punisher RP as soon as season one on Netflix came out, for example.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Take a look at what I am interested in actually writing just below, and if you find your interest piqued further and want to delve into any of these worlds with me and create some characters, get right into it and start brainstorming and seeing if we vibe, please send me a PM.

I'm not interested in using canon characters from the show or anything like that anyway, so it hardly matters. You also don't have to have seen either version since I just want to borrow a little inspiration from a couple of the characters and their backstories, but still maintain all original OC's. I'd like to play a character with a lot on her plate like Fiona. A couple or more dead-end jobs and side hustles. A few younger siblings she's been responsible for since she was old enough to walk, basically. Absent parents with likely substance ab\\*se problems. I'd like to deal with a lot of the same heavy themes that come up in the show that I'm not allowed to type here I think??? I wanna go there, but still have moments of one on one interaction and affection, relationship development and fun in the form of them doing slice of life stuff like talking while they wash dishes or going for a drive or having coffee at midnight after a long day. I want to pair her with either a guy like Jimmy-Steve who is wealthy because he has his own dangerous hustle. But maybe without all that pesky lying? Maybe someone more honest, more \"noble\" if there is any nobility among thieves. Maybe a character like the main in Drive. Same kind of job. These are just ideas and certainly nothing you have to listen to, I'm just throwing stuff out there. Alternately I could also see her paired with someone a bit older, someone wealthy, a business owner like a hotel or restaurant owners or even an executive. Open to maybe even having him be married with kids, maybe their relationship starting from dishonesty but developing into something real. Idk. I wanna work on something like this. Slice of life elements with plenty of drama, plenty of gritty realness but also lightness and love and family.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I **don't** *usually* double, but I think that I would also really **consider doubling** in this plot, but only as another character or my main **with another female character**. So a poly relationship, a friend, whatever we cook up, but between two women instead of the main male character you create. Keeping in mind I am very inexperienced with these pairings, which would likely also reflect in my character at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661 Punisher-ish**  \ud83d\udc80  **-** Now that I mentioned it above I remember how much I wanted to RP something after I watched season one of The Punisher on Netflix. I haven't watched season 2 yet 'cause I know it's the last one and it makes me sad and I wanna savor it, maybe even while I'm getting ready for this role if someone picks this up, but I never did get anyone to actually RP with me in a story like this. I wanted to play either opposite Frank Castle or more preferably a character VERY heavily based off of him, with an OC of my own creation that I'd tailor make for our story. I had a few different ideas we could discuss, but the main thing is I loved the idea of a romance in the middle of a lot of chaos and danger and pretty non-stop action once it gets ramped up. I also love having a character that may start out a little unsure of herself, but will learn and grow. She'd have some skill from her childhood and/or background to build off of, and plenty of nerve, and I think that's a good start.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\u2661\u2661\u2661 Sharp Objects** \\- Last Summer like a lot of people I was totally enamored by the HBO show. I know some people didn't like it, and I don't want to adapt or borrow from it honestly beyond the vibe. I want a small-town drama, maybe even a mystery (new to this genre, so my partner would need a ton of patience with me here) and a character that's like the character Amy Adams portrays in that she struggles with addiction and with a complicated relationship with her family and the locals. You might play a local, someone new to town of any number of professions. Maybe even a new police officer in town as I imagine she might have a couple of run-in with the law under her belt, and maybe some more in her future and that could certainly complicate things if she's a hot mess and he's the law. But there are a ton of options. Open to suggestions for setting and such here. Would love to brainstorm this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\u2661\u2661\u2661 Merpeople**  \ud83e\udddc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \ud83e\udddc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f   **-** Yeah, I know, ancient trope, but like...I've never actually done a roleplay like this and I've always, always wanted to! I'm very keen on it. I'd love to craft a world where there is a kingdom (actually, many!) in the ocean, and pair a mermaid/siren with either a human or ideally another merperson. I'd love to actually see her paired with a sea god, but I don't like to dictate tooooo much of my partner's characters. I like the idea of having different races and kingdoms relegated to different parts of the world's deepest bodies of water.  The only thing I ask is that any character you create must be mostly humanoid and not toooo monstrous, but I love the idea of incorporating for example lionfish fins or active/adaptive camouflage or really any combination that suits your imagination, as long as they have a human-like torso and preferably legs, as my mermaid will be the sort with \"legs.\" I see a lot of room for depth and drama and action though. We could dash some amazing writing and storytelling on this concept and make it great.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\u2661\u2661\u2661** Something with some pretty **heavy sci-fi/space** themes  \ud83d\udc7d \ud83e\udd16 \ud83d\udef0 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\udef8    -  A crew waking up on a colony, or scientists and colony members waking on either a ship, a colony, or a new planet. Borrowing some themes from some of the Alien and Bladerunner films would be a lot of fun too if done right and with our own spin. This is a big crave at the moment. I would love to develop something in this genre with a talented partner with similar interest in these types of stories and worlds. Maybe adding in some elements of Handmaid's Tale or Annihilation or something else to make it ours. I am always down to add in themes of horror, suspense, mystery. I love adding layers to stories as they reveal them to us like petals peeling away from a flower.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn a completely different direction but perhaps the same greater setting, I also have an idea I've been toying around with that borrows some concepts from Nail Gaiman's Stardust and...Guardians of the Galaxy? Of all places?\n\nIt would involve my character, a star in the most literal sense of the word, being plucked or maybe knocked from where she'd been radiating and singing her songs for millennia in a remote galaxy. I imagine this would have to be accomplished by a god-like cosmic being of immense strength, and while I am not opposed to the idea of it being an accident, I think great purpose would likely be needed to displace her, as she is herself a being of creation and light and power. She'd become personified and take on a human-like form, either by choice, force, or accident and then we could develop a love story that could ensue thereafter, entangled in some danger, adventure, drama, etc. I know this all sounds a little out there, and it kind of is, but that's also what I like about it? I like to take ideas and tropes and turn them on their heads and drench them in delicious writing and replace the characters with our own, so complex and beautiful we weep as they weep, we feel joy and triumph as they feel them. **I am really, really interested in something grand and sweeping like this that almost mixes fantasy with sci-fi.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd last, but certainly not least I have been wanting to ***maybe*** ease into something in the Star Wars universe. I've been a fan for as long as I can remember, but I'm no expert, though I do love research and delving into stuff like that. It would again have romance as the central theme, however. I love the Star Wars universe though, so it'd be really fun to play in. **Don't contact me about this if you're a rabid fanboy who is going to nitpick. Not interested.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have a few more ideas in these realms, too and have been in a pretty big sci-fi mood lately so if you'd like to explore some themes and try and figure out something that would make the both of us happy please send me a message. **\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\u2661\u2661\u2661 Montauk/New England** \\- This is my second biggest crave at the moment. It's summer, and while I don't generally care for summer, for some reason I've been wanting to write about hot days on the beach, saltwater smell, crashing waves. I want something ideally set in Montauk, New York. It's Hamptons-adjacent and I would like to play a local girl opposite your character, a married father of 2 or 2.5 kids, a wealthy vacationer from Manhattan or some other equally bustling city. His personality, job, etc is up to you, but I do want him married with kids basically.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI love the small North East US Coastal fishing town vibes and the local culture being invaded by tourism every summer but still managing to breed the rare romance. She'd be maybe a teacher, maybe a server at a diner who could be hired on as the nanny or baby sitter for the summer even. Transparently The Affair, specifically the first season, is my inspiration for a lot of the seeds of this idea, but that's where it deviates into what we'd like to make it. I do want drama, and a love story, but a messy one. Maybe some heavy themes like domestic violence in an abusive husband who she can't get away from, mental illness, grief, loss, infidelity in the affair between our characters, etc. And to be clear, though the concept of an affair probably does bring to mind some tawdry ideas, and there's plenty of fun to be had there, I want this to be a love story at center. Relationships are complicated. Love is complicated. I want a little complication.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Other fragments of ideas/characters:\n\n**\u2661\u2661\u2661** Something set in a **small southern town -** Just maybe minus all the racism and misogyny? At least as far as our characters go. I grew up in a town like this, and leaving it has left me nostalgic for some of that undeniable southern charm. Slice of life-ish with drama and such thrown in. A romance, an affair, a love triangle.\n\n**\u2661\u2661\u2661** **Westworld**  \ud83e\udd20 - Two guests meet in the park (doesn't have to be exactly like the one in the show) and fall in love. Adventure and danger and lots of fun and drama could be outlined for this easily. Open to some light sci-fi elements for this one. very subtle things, nothing too overt.\n\n**\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661 RDR/The Revenant/Western US in the 1800s**  \ud83e\udd20 - Pretty straight forward, just delving into a romance set in the wild west. Instead of being in a park and from a modern or futuristic present, we'd be dabbling in some historical fiction. I mention these specific media examples as reference for vibe/setting, though I am certainly not opposed to borrowing themes from any source.\n\n**\u2661\u2661\u2661 Stranger Things OC...sort of -** Not really based on the show except the only way I can describe the character I'd like to play is as an adult eleven? But not in a creepy or disgusting way in any capacity, I just want to play an OC in her early 20's probably with powers like hers. So telekinesis, dimension hopping, etc. And with a similar background. She's the result of experimentation,  kept in a lab setting for most of her life, experimented on. It's not a new thing, I could probably think of quite a few other tv shows and movies that play on the whole idea, but I loved the horror and darker themes of that show, and it's the freshest example in my mind. I'd also be willing to play this type of character in different settings/genres though. Maybe fantasy, more space-bound sci-fi or a futuristic setting. We can cook something fun up with her I think.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese would of course need to be developed a lot more, but I truly love that kind of collaborative development of plot and characters, so that's fine by me. I prefer to leave things as more of a loose skeleton without fleshing everything as far as plot and narrative out tooooo much, because I like for the characters to kind of help to illuminate the way as we go. **Brainstorming and sharing ideas is great, plotting things to death and down to the very last detail isn't much fun for me though.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u2661 No matter what kind of world and characters we work in and with, I want a heavy, unforgivably human type of story that will ultimately reward us with a beautiful narrative and characters that feel real and alive. Hopefully a friendship and/or writing partnership. Maybe the start of a whole new world we can dabble and play in at our leisure. That's always my hope.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want beauty and heartache and pain and drama and love and yeah, I want a little magic but not in the fantasy sense of the word. I want the magic of two creative, talented minds working together for a common goal and breathing life with words. I want a nice slow to medium-burn of a love story to start out hopefully many lovely stories we can tell together. There are universes to be made.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have characters already kind of fleshed out a bit in my mind and some ideas for side characters and plot and backstory and such for the craves listed here, depending on what your character is like and what we decide of course on for the tone and plot. I want some elements of slice of life, but forward-driving plot at a decent pace. I write with as much depth, detail, and color as I possibly can but sometimes it will be more casual, sometimes it will be really lengthy, just depending on mood.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**If any of this sounds good to you, please don't hesitate to PM me and we can go from there. Most of the above can be worked out.**\n\n# \u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\n\n# Bonus rambling:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u2661 Usually having the male main character at least a couple of years older than the character I am playing will end up being my vibe. I like to make female characters that challenge and assert against men who might consciously or unconsciously use age as an excuse to dismiss or otherwise silence or stifle them at the beginning, or if they're not the type sometimes also perhaps to use that juxtaposition of age and character for fun because of some of these societally pre-conceived notions, etc.\n\n\u2661 Taking breaks for burnout is totally fine, I will probably take a couple over the course of say, a year, and that's why I prefer having long-term partners. Ditching though, I don't appreciate and try not to do myself. Just let me know, I get it. We're human beings with lives and mental and physical health needs. Or maybe we just aren't meshing? Don't sweat it, just tell me. I will certainly try and do the same.\n\n\u2661 I can get **very** into world, mood and character building and have in the past collaborated on playlists, character references, setting reference, mood boards, etc. with writing partners to help expand on the world based on the mood, using these things as a way to further get on the same page so we can write in both the same tone and from the closest that I think two minds can probably get when working on one world together from two totally different upbringings, sometimes writing styles, background, history, experience, mood, locations in the world, etc. There are a lot of variables, but I feel like discussing characters and setting and vibes and themes you want to include and songs that make you think of a character or a moment or a feeling related to the story and all of that can level some of those variables and bring two people to the same place creatively. It's magic when it happens, and if you've experienced it you know it, and I guess that's what I am looking for again. A little magic, no big deal. Right?\n\n\u2661 I like to tell stories that can sometimes span generations. Maybe even time and space. But most important, stories about families and characters that feel real and who come to life for us. I like having things that I write with long-term writing partners eventually be woven together in some way or another, so that it's a cohesive world, even if in one story we're dabbling in Science Fiction and then in another maybe historical fiction or slice of life or anything in-between. I love doing stuff like that and being collaborative about world building and borrowing characters and adding generations and ancestors and relatives to families as we go and as the opportunity arises no matter the genre or era we are writing in. I've yet to meet a plot line I can't at least loosely tie together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# PM ME NOW IF YOU'VE MADE IT THIS FAR! \u2661",

I've been roleplaying since I was 12 years old, I'm 19 now so I have years of experience and like to think I'm pretty decent at this roleplay thing.  I love to roleplay, anything Fantasy is definitely my thing, I started off doing Fantasy and it's always been where my heart is at. I also do sci-fi, and slice of life (though I struggle with slice of life depending on the role). I'd love to come up with a role with whoever replies, I love making a world we'll both enjoy and a character dynamic/story. If it ends up we have a role we both enjoy I will likely become much more talkative as the ideas flow and I come up with sneaky future plans and such. I only roleplay 1st POV, the only way I can connect with my character. My roleplay style is definitely quality over quantity meaning my replies will vary in length but never be less then 5 sentences and never poorly written. My main platforms are here or Discord, just ask for my tag and i'll send it to ya. \n\nIn terms of things I like in Roleplays...\n- Your character can 100% be whoever they want to be but I've found I like characters who greatly conflict with mine. Characters who are very stoic, hot-headed, bossy/commanding, mean really get me and my character going lol. I also enjoy non-human characters (with some human-like features) so if you want to use one I 100% don't mind\n- Slow-burn romances are the best to me, also build up to N-s-f-w is something I will ALWAYS have a deep appreciation for especially if our characters definitely want to get with each other but pride gets in the way until they can't stand it anymore and just have to give in.\n- Good Plots and Stories, get us invested in it, let's make a whimsical world with a deep backstory\n- A good height difference is always very appreciated, very very appreciated.\n\nTypes of Roleplays I'm currently looking for are...\n- Sci-fi, something Avatar inspired.\n- Monster boyfriend and Human girlfriend going through the hardships of being together\n   \u2022 An alternate to this is college roommates and the romance grows over time. You still being the monster and me the human.\n- Zombie Apocalypse\n- Always looking for anything Medieval Fantasy, absolutely love a good Fantasy.",

I understand that life gets busy I just ask if your going to be gone for a long period to let me know. \n\nI am ok with you bringing a prompt or going with mine. I prefer fantasy of all kinds. I'm good with dark and scary to fun and adventure. \n\nI like to do slow growing relationship roleplays. This can be strangers to friends to relationship on or anywhere in between. Of course if the relationship grows to the bedroom that happens. I like there to be a range from action-adventure-drama and in-between.\n\nI have a few different ideas in mind but I'm always open. I do like the cliche ideas (the obvious being the hero saving the damsel in distress). \nJust a few ideas (I'm like to be vuage so suprised can happen):\n\nYour driving home from work and find a woman in a tattered white dress laying on the side of the road.\n\nYou're a werewolf walking into a bar with his friends and suddenly smell a vampires sent\n\nYou're at home cooking dinner when all of a sudden a woman runs in your front door slamming it behind her. She is is a ripped black outfit.\n\nOur characters meet we don't know what eachothers are at all it's kept secret until reveal in character. \n\n\n\nI'm pretty laid back and just ask that you are online often and have decent responses. Please PLEASE give me a lot to read I love details. I'll always try to match whatever I'm getting length and quality wise. Don't be afraid to take the story and run with it. \n\nIf your interested I like to be on discord or Kik. Pm me if your interested.",

(:\n\nI\u2019m currently seeking a semi-lit to advanced literate partner, for any genre/style of roleplay. I\u2019m usually into the more adventurous, action type roleplays, but I\u2019m also up for romance, sci-fi, fantasy, etc! \n\nI write in both first and third person, and I usually mirror my partners writing length, but anything below 2 paragraphs can get a bit boring, but I understand the scene or setting could be rough, so writing a lot wouldn\u2019t be easy!\n\nI\u2019m active throughout the week, all day. I work night shifts, so I probably will be least inactive during the night and morning because I sleep in a bit haha, but I\u2019ll always try to respond as soon as possible.\n\nI don\u2019t have any specific ideas in mind, but hopefully you and I can brainstorm off genres and past ideas, or maybe you have an idea you\u2019ve always wanted to act out. I\u2019m up for mostly anything!\n\nAvailable on three platforms which are; Discord, Kik, and here. Highly prefer Discord because of its server option. Keeps it organized and nice.

            "selftext": "Discord Plays Stellaris is a fun little concept that just turned one years old and is going on pretty well so far! The idea was to take a Stellaris game that would usually be a single player effort and instead make all of the decisions in-game controlled by a large community of players. Much like a Model UN!\n\nFrom there DPS has become a multi-faceted RP community where people can help build a military, or discover new technologies and write in their own inventions, or maybe just write laws with tiny little details that establish their own private militias in hopes that they may one day stage a coup d'etat and claim the nation for their Worm cult. Of course, that kind of silliness doesn't happen all of the time, often it's just people hanging out with others discussing their character's vision for the future or hanging around a canteen drinking rum with a friend. Thanks to some clever utilization of bots, dedicated Game masters, and discord's channel system this kind of mass roleplay is made possible!\n\nIt's a pretty wild community, but it's one that has collectively built a world within the framing of Stellaris, and there's a little something for everyone! Casual RP and world building much like a more freeform Star Trek organization in the Research side of things, Political RP where fascists and communists and alien loving xenophiles duke it out on the Council floor, and in the middle of both is the military who go about shouting orders at each other and quietly waiting until they can lead their ships into combat. We are currently in the early years of The Solar Federation, a federal union of human worlds who are disparate in thinking but enthusiastic in action.\n\nHere's the link if you want to hang around! We could always use some more people aboard: https://discord.gg/6ABYBHd\n\nAny questions feel free to ask either here or on the server in the #speak-with-staff channel.",

            "selftext": "HELLO! I've had a giant itch lately and that itch is making me do some MHA roleplay. This roleplay will be a timeskip roleplay either set several years into the future after Class 1-A have all been pros for years OR a timeskip to just after they graduated from U.A. high.\n\nI'm a massive My Hero Academia fan so I'll be playing a ton of characters! Here are my rules/notes for the RP:\n\n* If you plan on playing a canon character, I require you to be caught up to the manga! If you are playing an OC, this is unnecessary.\n* Due to the nature of the RP, spoilers will be included from time to time!\n* I do NOT mind you playing a character (specifically an OC) with a strong quirk. But you have to be smart about it. Are they making bad use of their strong quirk? Are they MASTERS of their quirk? Give them some drawbacks.\n\nOkay that's all I can think of for that part. Now to what I am looking for in a partner:\n\n* 18+ in age! Dark themes can and will occur in this roleplay. Happens all the time in the anime/manga!\n* Literate.\n* Minimum one paragraph per response. The more the merrier!\n* 2-3 responses per day. Same thing goes here, even more and I'll be a happy roleplayer! I understand life gets in the way so if you can't meet the requirement don't worry! I'll understand.\n* Lately I have been doing a lot of low effort RP's (which isn't necessarily a bad thing, some people enjoy short replies and such) so I'll be scouting out for higher tier roleplayers this time around. This doesn't mean you have to be a literary genius of the new millennia, but I am looking for passion and effort put into posts, even if they are on the shorter side of things. I want someone to suck me into the roleplay!\n\nThat's just about everything! If you're interested please send my a DM and we'll flesh things out from there :\\^)",

Pretty much something like if the last airbender had a child with game of thrones or something like that. Although I would like to think that there would be more than four elements.  I think it would be fun to imagine what kind of societies  each of the kingdoms or whatever developed. Are the rock people mountain clans or leaders of an empire with massive strongholds. Do the wind people live in plains of grass like horsemen or are they ascetic living in mountains and mastering flight. So yeah, stuff like  that. As far as the plot goes I'll leave it open but some ideas could be an exiled ruler, a company of bounty hunters, a hedge knight and what not.\n\nSo if any of this is mildly interesting let me know.",

            "selftext": "Hello, fellow writers!  \n\nThank you for taking the time to read my roleplay post.  Let me start off by introducing myself \u2014 I\u2019m a man in his mid-20s who (like many of you) is seeking to find a roleplay partner.  I've been somewhat busy due to grad school, but as of late, it has been truly refreshing to connect with so many other like-minded people in this community of writers.  Given that I\u2019m expecting to have a bit more time on my hands in the upcoming weeks, I figured I\u2019d reach out again, and hopefully find a few more mature, talented writers.\n\n**Preferred Genres:**\n\nMy writing tends to span a wide variety of genres\u2014including science fiction, historical fiction, and realistic modern fiction.  My writing has spanned both a personal as well professional nature, and as a result, I\u2019m always up for experimenting with new genres and writing styles.  Recently, I\u2019ve been dabbling a bit more in fantasy themes; however, I\u2019m still a novice when it comes to taking on high-fantasy themes.\n\n**Writing Style:**\n\nI will humbly admit that I tend to be a voracious writer, and as a result, my posts frequently range in the 3-4+ paragraph range.  Granted, there are certain occasions when a shorter length is more desirable (especially in conversational, or dialogue-intensive scenes)\u2014and this is certainly something I implement when necessary.  I\u2019m a strong believer in quality over quantity, and I\u2019m hoping to find a fellow writer who has an appreciation for packing a large quantity of details in a condensed post (within reason).\n\n**Collaboration:**\n\nFor me, the pre-writing, collaborative stage is as enjoyable as the writing process itself.  I know that some writers prefer to jump head-first into writing the story itself\u2014with minimal discussion.  Based on experience, this approach is due to the fact that some writers fear that too much discussion may \u201creveal\u201d too much of the plot prior to writing.  While this is certainly a valid point, it is important for me to mention that my discussions do not pertain to plot;  rather, they pertain to exploring the characters\u2019 backstories, emotional orientations, cultural groundings, and other such factors.  It\u2019s more with regard to developing a creative discourse with my writing partner to truly immerse\u2014and \u201clive\u201d\u2014the experiences of our characters.  To me, it is this level of exploration and collaboration that truly make roleplaying a much more engaging process as compared to solo writing.\n\n**Writing Platforms:**\n\nI prefer to write my stories via email; however, I strongly prefer to collaborate with my co-writers via a text IM platform such as Skype, Google Hangouts, or Discord.  This is largely because an IM platform allows for a truly conversational, back-and-forth discourse about the story (rather than a static series of isolated messages via email).  I also find that my best stories tend to emerge with individuals with whom I am able to cultivate a strong intellectual chemistry with\u2014and as a result, this has led to several long-term stories.  I would be absolutely thrilled to find other writers in this subreddit who are also looking for long-term stories.  \n\n**Hard Requirements in a Writing Partner:**\n\n* **Be over 18 [ideally over 21].**  This is not to suggest that my stories always involve adult themes.  In fact, many of my stories do not involve NSFW themes at all.  However, I feel exponentially more comfortable discussing literary ideas with fellow adults.  As a result, I set this as a strict limit, and I have a zero tolerance policy for those who lie about their age.  As a result, I will be firm for only this particular issue\u2014 *do not contact me unless you are 18 years of age.*\n\n* **Interested in conversation and collaboration.**  As I mentioned above, I\u2019m seeking a writer who is truly interested in forming a long-term collaborative writing partnership.  This means not only focusing on issues pertaining to our story at hand, but also to broader issues concerning our writing as a whole.  Ideally, it would be nice to connect with other working professionals who are looking to use writing as a creative outlet, of sorts.\n\n* **Mutual respect.**  As I\u2019m sure is the case with many of you, I simply cannot be in front of the computer 24/7 due to real life responsibilities and obligations.  Because of this, I hope to find a writer who is committed, yet flexible\u2014someone who is willing to maintain open communication while at the same time, respecting one another\u2019s autonomy.\n\nIf this post has captured your interest or imagination, then by all means, I would love to hear from you!  In your post, please tell me a bit about yourself, and your background in writing.  Hopefully we can get a conversation going, and weave our way into writing a story together.\n\nThanks for your time; I hope to hear from you!",

Also I\u2019d prefer if the roleplay, at least in the beginning stages, stayed more on the topic of developing the plot and the characters.\n\nMy idea for the beginning of plot is the following: One of the guys  is \u201cattacked\u201d on one night and starts noticing weird changes on his body and mind, which start to get more and more noticeable until he fully turns. He skips school for a few days and cuts contact with his best friend at the same time which makes him worry. Once he comes back he tries to play everything cool but his friend doesn\u2019t buy it and notices the small chances like the pale and cold skin and tries to figure out what\u2019s going on with him. \n\nI\u2019m fine with roleplaying as any of the characters so feel free to tell me your preference as well.

Can be anything at this point although I don't particularly like slice of life rps. \n\nI prefer fandom and to have cannon with my oc but I'm okay with two ocs or doubling roles. \n\nSupernatural, MCU, Harry Potter, True Blood, Hemlock Grove, Vampire Diaries are just a few fandoms I like to rp in. There's more but these are my favorite.\n\nI can do mxf fxf and mxm but I prefer mxf \n\nI have a list of fandoms and cannon I'd like to do but it doesn't have to be fandom related. \n\nI only rp in 3rd person. At least 4 sentences but more is greatly appreciated. The more detailed the better. \n\nI have Kik, discord and hangouts to rp on. \n\nI don't mind talking ooc between the rps. \n\nTime zones don't matter to me. \n\nI can't believe I have to add this but I will not be able to do quick replies a lot of the time. If you expect a response in 2 minutes and if you continue to message me to let me know you replied (spoiler alert, I know you did), I won't be likely to respond. If it's been a few days, then yes please let me know. I jump from my phone to my computer during the day and occasionally notifications get lost. \n\nWith that said, if you have any questions, please feel free to dm me.",

            "selftext": "I literally couldn't think of a better title than that, I swear.\n\n\nThat aside, Hello! I'm back, today looking for less of a prompt, and more of a...general search? I have no idea. Before I get into the nitty gritty, allow me to say a bit about myself. I'm a 20-something male with plenty of writing experience, about 6ish years or so. I'm the kind of guy who (proudly) sprouts absurd and out there ideas, literally just on a whim or the slightest bit of inspiration. Seriously. Sometimes I can get a little crazy. My post length is anywhere between 1-3 paragraphs, but I came definitely get more out if I'm feeling inspired.  I'm also, for whom it might concern, in the central timezone of the United States. That being said, I have a horrid sleep schedule, so I'll usually be up pretty late into the night.\n\n\nWith that out of the way, let me say what I'm looking for. I am (unsurprisingly) looking for a female partner to nerd out with, 18+ of course, just in case we *do* go down a NSFW road at some point (It's welcome, but I'd like to not to be the focus of anything). **I will not, under any circumstances, write with someone under the age of 18**. I'm not comfortable with it, and I'm sorry if someone out there disagrees with this. Additionally, I'm looking for someone that I can call my friend. All proper and business is boring. I like to freak out with my writing partners. Come up with dumb plotlines or AUs. If you're looking for something strictly professional, I'm probably not your guy.\n\n\n\nFinally, we get down to what I'm *really* gonna be vague on. As you might've guessed by the title, I'm looking for something fantasy related. What specifically, you might ask? I have no clue. I'm a sucker for romance plots, with an epic adventure hanging above our characters' head. Be it slaying gods, or sealing away an ancient evil, I can't get enough of it. I love all sorts of different fantasy races, too. Elves? Oh yeah. Demons? Sure! Any kind of Yokai? *my god, that'll press my buttons in juuust the right way*. That being said, anyone that brings an idea with **Kitsune** as a major emphasis will make me *very* happy. Anyway. If you have any existing ideas, please, throw them at me! I love reading through plots n ideas. Want to create something new? We can chat for a bit, and see what we both like.\n\n\nI'm rambling now, aren't I? I think I've gone on for long enough. If I've caught your eye, please, shoot me a message, and I'll get to you ASAP. I get a lot of messages, so I'm sorry if I don't get to you right away. Some messages also slip through the cracks, or don't follow a certain obvious rule, so sorry on that regard as well. Just be sure to include your favorite color in your title, so I know you got down this far. I won't respond without it, because I don't enjoy it when people don't read my post. Like I said, I'm usually around into the late hours of the night, so you'll likely catch me. Thanks for reading!\n\n\n(Oh, by the way, don't send me a message only saying \"hey I think we can work something out\" or the like. Tell me about yourself, have some energy. Those kind of intros give me life)",

            "selftext": "Hello! My name is Beth, I am 18 and in search of a partner! I have been roleplaying for a few years now.  \n\n\nI write in first POV, and average 2-5 paragraphs (generally around three when narration based and two when interaction based). Although for starters, I tend to write quite a lot to set the scene. I\u2019m looking for someone who will be able to consistently write as much as me. One of my least favourite things is when I write 3 paragraphs, and I get one in reply. I love detail. \nI\u2019d be willing to try 3rd, but I am unexperienced so some patience would be required. \n\nI also tend to play characters who are more uh...morally compromised. Meaning I like to play anti-hero or villain types. I like to play action, crime, some romance.  I have a few OC roles, all based in sci-fi (think mutants, X-Men), crime, and romance.\n\n\nI\u2019m pretty strict on grammar and spelling, but everyone makes mistakes sometimes! I also do not like or engage in asterisk rp. It isn\u2019t my personal style. I will provide a sample of my own rping style if you would like, as I usually ask for one from you as well. \n\n\nI\u2019m looking for someone who can reply at least once a day, as well as understand sometimes that is all I can do. I have some medical issues that hopefully will be sorted out, but right now I have good days and bad. On my good days, I usually reply almost right away! I hope that can make up for the days that I\u2019m sick.  Ideally I\u2019m looking for someone who has at least six months experience. I would like someone within ten years of my own age, if that is ok. Anyway, I don\u2019t want to drone on.\nMessage me if this sounds interesting! Looking forward to hearing from you.",

            "selftext": "HELLO! I've had a giant itch lately and that itch is making me do some MHA roleplay. This roleplay will be a timeskip roleplay either set several years into the future after Class 1-A have all been pros for years OR a timeskip to just after they graduated from U.A. high.\n\nI'm a massive My Hero Academia fan so I'll be playing a ton of characters! Here are my rules/notes for the RP:\n\n* If you plan on playing a canon character, I require you to be caught up to the manga! If you are playing an OC, this is unnecessary.\n* Due to the nature of the RP, spoilers will be included from time to time!\n* I do NOT mind you playing a character (specifically an OC) with a strong quirk. But you have to be smart about it. Are they making bad use of their strong quirk? Are they MASTERS of their quirk? Give them some drawbacks.\n\nOkay that's all I can think of for that part. Now to what I am looking for in a partner:\n\n* 18+ in age! Dark themes can and will occur in this roleplay. Happens all the time in the anime/manga!\n* Literate.\n* Minimum one paragraph per response. The more the merrier!\n* 2-3 responses per day. Same thing goes here, even more and I'll be a happy roleplayer! I understand life gets in the way so if you can't meet the requirement don't worry! I'll understand.\n* Lately I have been doing a lot of low effort RP's (which isn't necessarily a bad thing, some people enjoy short replies and such) so I'll be scouting out for higher tier roleplayers this time around. This doesn't mean you have to be a literary genius of the new millennia, but I am looking for passion and effort put into posts, even if they are on the shorter side of things. I want someone to suck me into the roleplay!\n\nThat's just about everything! If you're interested please send my a DM and we'll flesh things out from there :\\^)",

            "selftext": " \n\nThe old Gods are gone. For centuries they had toyed with the mortal realm, bleeding their corruption and chaos into the hearts of the weak-willed and greedy. The promise of power and money was too much to resist. Where once stood a land of peace and plenty, different races living in civility and co-operation, there now were distrust and hatred. Some historians, philosophers and theologians say that the Gods merely fed the feelings and sentiments that had always been bubbling beneath the veneer of peace for decades previous. They say that the default setting of the mortal soul is to hate the concept of \\*other\\*. Perhaps that is true. Perhaps the old Gods did just do nothing more than give mortals the means to wage wars, rather than a reason to. \\*Reason\\* as a concept was in short supply during this time.\n\nThe Elderlands burned for many years. The continent split along racial lines, and people soon forgot why they were fighting at all. Just that they knew they had to. The fighting continued and the number of lives lost were inumerable. It all culminated on cataclysmic battle. referred to in years to come as \"The Battle of Two Tears.\" Alliances were formed; humans, orcs and dwarves on one side. Elves, werewolves and vampires on the other. The fighting was so fierce that the ground itself shook, to the point where the continent started to literally break apart. The leylines cracked and tore the continent up into smaller pieces.\n\nThis event shook the souls of mortals and brought them out from the grip of the Gods. Their power gone, they were essentially banished from the mortal realm into the leylines and deep into the world's core where they remain to this day, never to emerge again. On the surface, the various races split apart again though they did not fight. Instead they found pieces of the newly broken continent for themselves and made it their own. Kingdoms and borders were formed and for a while civility broke out again. But when old habits started to come to the fore it was decided that the Elderlands should be ruled by one monarch. The first was a human king, a man called Ambris was named King of the Elderlands. Ambris had fought in the Battle of Two Tears and was instrumental in achieving the new found peace. He ruled with kindness and generosity. always striving to achieve the sort of unity that had existed before the Gods came into play. As a tribute, the capital of the Elderlands was named after him - Ambris City.\n\nKing Ambris never truly achieved his goal to fully unify the races. But there was peace at least. His reign was a success in all bar one aspect - he left no heirs. Now, without a unifying presence, the tensions are starting to rise again. In one of his last acts as King, he passed a law that each racial faction was free to uphold its own laws within its own territory. And that anyone who ventures into these territories did so in full knowledge of this. After his death though the faction laws grew more sinister. They stopped aiming at self-governance and started targeting other races again. Some say that the old Gods are coming back, others say its just new Gods taking their place but despite this, Ambris City remains a neutral haven in all of this simmering tension.\n\nIn the absence of a King or a Queen, the Elderlands are ruled by a High Council. Four beings one from each main race, elected by their kin and each with their own motives and aspirations for the Elderlands.\n\nPresently, the thin veneer of peace in the Elderlands is still holding. The only wars that are fought are in the town halls, with words rather than swords. That isn't to say there is no conflict. Racial prejudice and xenophobia is rife. The dream of a truly multicultural society hangs by a thread.\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you've gotten this far, then thank you for reading. The Elderlands is a small open-world medieval/fantasy server looking to expand. Players can play as: humans (including northmen and templar knight factions), orcs, dwarves, elves, goblins, halfbreeds, vampires and werewolves. You can create factions of your own IC as well.\n\nThere is an overarching storyline being considered, but for the moment there is a plethora of side-quests to do either on your own or as part of a group for a reward. But in general, the story of your character is up to you. Combat is done on a roll-based system with a Dice Bot.\n\nIt is an 18+ server, as there are some NSFW themes. You don't have to be an experienced roleplayer, but if you are reasonably literate and write in third person narrative you will fit right in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Click Here For Discord Link](https://discord.gg/9u82e6N)",

We can do canon, OC's, or a mix (My preference on the latter two.)  \n\n\nI mainly stick to discord but if you prefer another medium such as email or another I'll gladly discuss that as well.\n\n  \nMy schedule is pretty flexible and I can easily get in a couple replies a day, but don't expect that from my partner, real life comes first so if a day or two guys by without a reply it's no problem, but it's a bonus if you can give me a heads up.  \n\n\nAs for themes I don't mind dark themes, and I don't have any triggers so feel free to come at me full force.  \n\n\nIf ATLA AU isn't your cup of tea I'll gladly world build with you!  \n\n\nJust shoot me a message if you're interested and we can get to plotting and RPing!",

            "selftext": "Hi there!\n\nI am an artist looking for a long term partner to do a roleplay in **3rd person via a private Discord server** with. **I use my own OCs**, and I am looking for someone else who plans to do the same. I have a bunch of ideas, so you can take your pick or we can make a new one. ***I am not seeking a solely NSFW roleplay.*** \n\n**The genres I like are:** Scifi (cyberpunk, cassette futurism), modern/traditional/dark/high/any fantasy, post-apocalyptic (any kind).\n\n# Loose premises (All modern fantasy):\n\n(Ways your character might interact are just suggestions.)\n\n1. **Characters:** ***Tom, Leona, Carlos -*** Tom and Leona can see demons who are disguised as humans. Tom hates demons because one possessed his former fiance, Carlos. He like to kill every demon, but Leona is more neutral, if somewhat sympathetic towards their general existence Carlos works as their housekeeper in exchange for Not Being Killed. **Your character(s) might...** Accidentally discover what Tom and Leona are doing, since demons to the general populace appear to be just regular humans. It would look like murder, as a result. Your character might be sympathetic to their cause.\n2. **Character:** ***Orion -*** Orion is an eclectic vampire with a harpy-like alternate form. He was kept as a part of a zoo belonging to a ruler until he escaped out into the desert that surrounded it. He is currently looking to hitchhike away from the folk looking for him, but that's difficult when the sun may burn him alive. **Your character(s) might...** Pick Orion up while he's trying to hitchhike, and the pair can go from there.\n3. **Character:** ***Leon -*** The setting is mostly modern, but typical fantastically-powered people or fantasy creatures such as werewolves, vampires, etc. are loosely integrated into society with the expected negative stigma. Leon came from a boarding school meant to properly educate these 'different' folk on how to act 'properly,' but he, as someone who is half demon (ok bear with me) is having trouble adjusting into society and finds himself getting into more trouble than he bargained for. **Your character(s) might...** Help Leon out somehow, or perhaps they're in a similar situation and the pair might find solidarity together.\n\n# Loose character concepts I would like to use, but I don't have a premise for:\n\n1. **(Fantasy) Quill:** A young witch who isn't all that great at magic. She lives in the countryside and practices her magic, but her attempts never seem to go well, and usually end in chaos.\n2. **(Cyberpunk) Josie:** A security robot that outlived her term of service. Her programming is a little janky, and she has an unabashedly sadistic disposition. She likes getting into trouble and making people's (but especially cops') lives difficult on purpose. She can and will hurt people for fun. *Alternatively:* Josie can be part of an entire cyberpunk gang.\n3. **(Semi-Modern Fantasy)**  **Lyssa:**\u00a0Lyssa is a half-goblin, half-orc that LOVES explosives and causing trouble. She lives in the desert and bothers caravans by either blowing them up for funsies or stealing from them.\n4. **(Any Genre I guess) Aster:** An 18th century fellow who was cursed, so his whole entire body turned to black, wormlike slugs. He keeps himself together with a Lot of clothing. He'd like to go back to normal.\n5. **(Scifi, whatever)**  **Nicol:** Mutant on an alien planet who yearns for more adventure than yeeting pack rats out of her dads' shed.\n\nDon't like any of those? I have more characters that can probably fit most anything, but those are the ones I have that I'd like to use the most. \n\n### What I'm looking for in a partner:\u00a0\n\n* **SFW Oriented (18+):**\u00a0I prefer roleplaying with other adults only. I am fine with adult content being included if it feels necessary and fits comfortably in the story, but I do not seek it out intentionally as the main content of a roleplay. I can write mostly whatever, but I usually try to adapt to what my partner wants to do.\n* **Literate Writers:**\u00a0I'm looking for partners who write in paragraph format (like a book)\u00a0in third person ONLY\u00a0and put forth a strong effort to use use proper grammar and spelling. My posts tend to be very lengthy and detailed, but I do not necessarily expect the same of you. Sometimes there's just little to say in a reply.\n* **Writers who respond relatively quickly:**\u00a0I usually reply immediately, but I know that's not always an option for some people. I would prefer to roleplay with a partner who can reply within 1-2 days.\n* **Creative folk capable of making decisions:**\u00a0I don't want to carry the whole RP! Please don't make me; that's fun for neither of us. I play multiple characters most of the time, be it PCs or NPCs. I would like if you are willing to put effort into potentially playing NPCs that you might create to diversify the story we're trying to create.\n* **Writers who handle rejection well:** Sometimes plots don't work out and we need to scrap an idea, restart, or rewrite. I'm interested in people who are open to doing that and/or won't be torn up if after a few replies it seems like we or our characters don't click as partners.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy main goal is to create a great, invested story with someone who is fun to work with both in and out of character. I am looking for willingness to be flexible, communicate, and collaborate to create a story the both of us can enjoy.\n\nI like the option for full creativity, where we can both worldbuild as we go within the story. I prefer that nobody 'leads', but if someone does, I prefer to do so.\n\n**Writing Sample:**\n\n&gt;The radar pinged. She ignored it. Agitation twitched up her spine as she walked lightly down the stairs and slipped into the upper hall. Windows into observance platforms caught the light, reflecting an image of herself back at her. She paused, stopping briefly to peer inside past her reflection, remarking at how foreign the labs she\u2019d spent quite a bit of time in looked in this desolate situation. It almost made her nostalgic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Describe your character in the comments or a PM, and tell me what premises/characters of mine you might be interested in. If we seem like a good match, I'll add you on Discord.",

I love writing though so my posts are always thought out and descriptive! I double main characters as well as play side characters. I would love if you did the same. \n\nI\u2019m looking for any sort of fantasy roleplay right now. I have some plots in mind we can discuss but I\u2019m also open to any plots you had in mind or to coming up with something completely new together. AS long as there is fantasy and action, I\u2019m good. I don\u2019t do slice of life roleplays (sorry friends). I am also only looking for MxF pairings right now. \n\nI\u2019ll keep this short and sweet so if this caught your interest, please send me a message! I can\u2019t wait to hear from you! Oh! One more thing: I really REALLY prefer to roleplay over email. The character limit on Discord drives me nuts.  However, if you only use Discord and you think we would be a really good match, I\u2019m willing to give Discord a try. Thank you! Hope to hear from you soon!",

            "selftext": "The title hero is often overused. People that take on trials for their own personal gain use it, as a way of sweeping their intentions under a thin cover. Others, use it as a title to be revered, and looked up to. Many heroes aren't the genuine article. Most of the time, they are just people, looking to set themselves aside from others.\n\nTrue heroes are often very rare, and very short lived. Well, most of them, at the very least. The primal mages of the Arcanum coast...well, they're a bit of an enigma. You could ask almost anyone in the kingdom about them, and you'd probably get a smattering of theories of what they are. Some will say primal mage is just a title, taken up by the next person in the line, others will say they're immortals, slumbering away until they're needed again. But out of all the theories, one bit of information is constant. The mage of storms was a coward, and abandoned his companions when they needed him the most.\n\nMost people sneer when that title is brought up. Even more so when people have the gall to utter \u201cStorm Raven\u201d, rather than boil it down to a simpler, more insulting title (although that was about as far as anyone could take it). What he did to earn that vilification wasn't exactly known, either. Most just left it with what they knew. Probably because it was the easier of the alternatives to accept.\n\nMost people wouldn't dare digging into his past. It would only be met with nasty looks and various other unsavory things. A few people were crazy enough to try and hunt down what happened, though.\n\nWho knew? Maybe someone would find the elusive \u201cStorm Raven\u201d slumbering, in some unmarked shrine, waiting for his companions to wake him up once more.\n\n)(\n\nAnd with that brief introduction, allow me to start this off with a brief explanation. This is, obviously, a fantasy rp, set in the country of Arcanum, aptly named because of all the magical happenings that fill the land. I'm planning on making this a rather expansive world, with plenty of lore and mysteries sprinkled in (if the above starter wasn't any indication). \n\nWith that, some ground rules. I'm looking for an 18+ partner, that can keep up with posts around 2-5 paragraphs. I am planning on some romance being included, hence the 18+ requirement. Other than that, some action and drama as well, along with three dimensional characters, all that jazz.\n\nI'm awful at these closing notes bits, so honestly, if I've caught your interest, shoot me a PM. Please add some detail in your introduction, I can't stress this enough. We can definitely work something out. Before I leave, though, I'll ask that if you do message me, put the word stormcloud in your message- it helps me know you read the entire prompt.",

I'm looking for someone who already has an idea, or wants to develop one to GM for me a story that is cerebral and psychological, gothic, with a romance in it. I am interested in a possible forbidden romance. I enjoy playing amnesiac characters and definitely characters that are ill or wounded and in need of care. I also really like gothic settings, creepy locales and houses, mysteries, anything where my character has to slowly uncover something. Lead me on! Anywhere you want to lead the story or any discussions you want to talk on this, I'm am open and looking forward to it! I know this is a bit vague, but it's more of an impulse that I have than anything, but it's an impulse I must respond to. Help me fulfill it! I am looking to escape a modern setting, something fantastical.\n\n---\n\nHere is an intro we can chose to use or not, something of a guideline for what I want:\n\n*Darkness. That was everything. that was the sum existence of the universe for a few precious moments before Rafe opening his eyes and it was illuminated by a single source, a lone candle at his bedside stand. Then came the pain. A dull, aching headache that brought his hands to his head to rub it. However, what truly roused him from his sleep was the sight of dried blood upon his hands.*\n\n*\"What?! What...happened?\"*\n\nAfter struggling to place this event, what could have caused such a distressing awakening, Rafe found a large black spot in what should have been his memory. He couldn't remember being here, he couldn't remember what led him here, and he certainly couldn't remember what caused his hands to be bathed in blood. Rafe carefully climbed out of bed, to realize he was clothed and still wearing his boots. Carefully grabbing the candlestick, he looked around the room. A turned over bookcase, a locked armoire, an unused vanity. Where was he?\n\nMore importantly, where was Ivy?",

I'd prefer if romance stuff happens that it'd be something of a slow burn, even it's just my character being the one taking a while to warm up.  Any smut stuff will wait until justified by the plot and development and WILL NOT EVER be the center of the story.  Doesn't matter what gender you are as long as you play a Female character.  Most of them I can deal with it being OC/OC but there are some I don't list I prefer the other writing canons for ~~since most OCs are very barebones~~.  Said fact also keeps me from playing canons for other OCs, so don't expect it.
