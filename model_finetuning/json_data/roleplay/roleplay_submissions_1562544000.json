            "selftext": "Hey y'all! 20 y/o dude here, looking for some new writing partners (preferably over 18, thanks x) to create some interesting stories and worlds along with! Now, what does that entail? Well...\n\nFirst and foremost, I generally look for a healthy dose of plot, action, and character development to be the focus of my roleplays. Honestly, though, I have to admit, what really gets me invested in an RP is worldbuilding. I absolutely love creating interesting and in-depth backstories for worlds, no matter the genre - the icing on the cake is then building compelling characters and story-lines to explore them. Thus, I'll give you a heads up right now - we probably won't be diving straight into an RP immediately. Personally, I like to take a chunk of time beforehand in order to put some thought into things like characters, plot-lines, and such. The little things, basically. Plus, it gives us an opportunity to figure each other out and all that beforehand, you know?\u00a0\n\nOn that subject, once again I'd appreciate it if you were 18+. Thanks in advance. It's always fun to experiment with darker, more mature themes. Plus, it's just nice to be free of a filter outside of RP. Side note, please don't hesitate to talk and screw around out of character, because I certainly won't - for me, it's half the fun. When things are more lighthearted, people are generally more willing to voice their opinions freely. Discussion is always encouraged! If you don't like something (or want to add something), tell me. Please don't hesitate to offer your thoughts and opinions on... well, anything; be it my writing, an idea I may have or propose, world construction, characters, etc. I don't take things personally; a huge reason of why I roleplay is to improve my writing and story-telling. Kinda hard to improve when you're repeating the same mistakes, isn't it?\u00a0  \n\n\nIncoming obligatory \"I'm looking for someone literate blah blah blah\". On a slightly more serious note, yes, I would appreciate it if you used good grammar and were descriptive. I'm no angel myself, believe me, but I do try. While we're on the subject, let's talk about post length. I'm not gonna say \"u need 50 lines 1000 words or else!\". I trust you can use your own discretion - quality over quantity, and all that. That said, I'm prone to writing too much from time to time - please excuse the occasional novel-length response from me. As mentioned, I'm here to improve my own writing and all that. However, more so than writing - or really, anything - I'd like to put emphasis on involvement. I envision this as being an experience where we're both putting forth ideas and contributing, not just one person doing everything. Just... be creative! Take your own liberties! That's really all I have to say on the matter.\n\nIf you've stuck with me through this, thanks. Hopefully, reading that wasn't as boring as writing it was. Now, we can move onto the topic of the actual roleplay itself - the fun stuff! Here's a few ideas/genres/worlds I've had poking about my head for awhile. Nothing is set in stone! Bear in mind, these are some of my ideas, really just meant to stir the pot more than anything else - send me some of yours! Let's create something together, no matter the genre! Atm, kinda feeling some fantasy plots [\ud83d\udc40](https://emojipedia.org/eyes/)\n\n* **Sci-Fi**  \n\n   * *Cyberpunk Space Dystopia -*\u00a0Honestly, probably the most developed and fleshed out idea I have on hand. I've written quite a bit of background for this, which I'd be happy to share if you're interested. Basically, the last\u00a0**\u2122**human space colony. Starring: the last humans, communists, rebels, upset aliens, angry space police, conspiracy theories, zealots, the illuminati, and more. Seriously, though, I've put a lot into this one.\n   * *Space Opera -*\u00a0This is something that I've actually got a lot of ideas for. Barebones concept: a universe/galaxy/star-system/whatever recovering from a long, bloody war to end all wars. A shaky, semi-recognized government, headed by a Council with representatives hailing from numerous different races, is formed. Obviously, though, trust isn't so easily forged. The scars of many lifetimes of conflict are still painfully evident - as such, tensions run high. Everyone is divided. Some refuse to let go of the past, to a greater degree. Numerous different factions/guilds form, each with their own agendas and motivations. Others, still, use this as fuel for their own corrupt agendas.\n   * *Post Apocalyptic -*\u00a0...with a twist! Earth has fallen. Corrupted by a mysterious, alien biotechnology, the state of the planet is... confusing. Whatever the case, it's been turned against its own inhabitants. Humanity has regressed, and society has dissolved almost entirely - it's every man for himself. Survivors brave the wastelands, combating and avoiding horrific biomechanical abominations as they do. Whispers of those who have managed to harness the mysterious scourge circulate; none dare believe them, for fear of the implications. And what of their alien \"overlords\"? None can say.\n   * *Earth at War/Mecha -*\u00a0What can I say? There's this new show - gen:lock - that has recently peaked my interest in the mecha genre recently. I can't lie, the concept of an Earth facing some sort of crisis with giant robots just sounds too cool to pass up. I'm itching to do my own take on this genre. Not really a proper idea so much as it is a suggestion/fantasy - perhaps, though, this would involve some sort of team dynamic between our characters? Seems like something that might work with maybe three or four people.\n* **Fantasy**\u00a0\\- too many character ideas/worlds to list here, and I'm sure you have a fair amount as well!  \n\n   * *Pirates -*\u00a0The idea of sailors on the high-fantasy seas just sounds cool to me. If it doesn't sound cool to you, then we can't be friends. I'm sure there are a bunch of plots we can think of for this, but because this is already getting waaay too long, I'll refrain from listing any.\n   * *Gladiators*\u00a0\\- Another thing that seems fun on paper. What's not amazing about a gladiatorial arena, featuring creatures of fantasy and myth?\n   * Something based in a world going through a war. Honestly, as cliche as it sounds, the old \"mysterious ancient creeping darkness\" plot sounds kinda fun to me. Perhaps in the backdrop of a war. I dunno.\n* **Western/Historical**\u00a0\\- ...is it too late to jump on the Red Dead bandwagon?  \n\n   * *1920s/30s -*\u00a0Mobster related stuff is always cool. A crime/thriller plot could be fun. Dibs on the detective character.\n   * *Victorian Era*\n   * *Ancient Rome/Greece*\n* **Fandoms**\u00a0\\- usually avoid fandom characters, but here are some worlds I'd be interested in messing about in anyhow  \n\n   * *Destiny/D2*\n   * *Generator Rex*\n   * *The Last Airbender/TLoK*\n   * *Voltron: Legendary Defender*\n   * *Marvel/DC*\n   * *Transformers - IDW especially, so many possibilities*\n   * *Fallout*\n   * *Ben 10*\n   * *Red Dead*\n   * *Halo*\n   * *Mass Effect*\n   * *...probably more I'm not thinking of.*\n* **...and ideas you might have! Seriously, just PM me. I don't bite, most of the time.**\n\nSince this is getting too long, I won't bore you (and myself) with any more details. You get the gist. Again, I can't say this enough, I want to hear your ideas, too! Everything above is just that - ideas. I'm absolutely open to what you've got in mind! Look forward to hearing from y'all!",

While this post is all business, I'm a goofy chatterbox who just happens to have been doing this long enough to know precisely what I'm looking for.\n\nI'm looking for other experienced roleplayers who have a bit of a grimdark streak in them, and who have discovered they genuinely enjoy playing a compelling villain. I am open to group recommendations, provided grimdark content is permitted and appreciated, the group is active (or new), and there is an engaging storyline that I have license to build upon.\n\nI'm nearly 30, so you should be okay with that and 18 at the very least. Even though I marked this NSFW to keep the kids out, I don't really care if there is explicit content in the roleplay or not. I'm partial to email and discord since I already have it set up, but I'm open to alternatives, provided I can access it from a computer. \n\nI play all genders and all pairings. I play against all genders and all pairings. Pairings are not inherently required in all cases. I do have a soft spot for Any Gender(villain \\[you\\])/F(heroine \\[me\\]) pairings of both romantic and non-romantic nature. While I will \"double\" in the sense that, you name the pairing/dynamic you want, and it's totally done, I do not play prefab or canon characters.\n\nI can write in third or first person, and prefer para+ length, but I emphasize escalation/complication over reply length. ESL/imperfect grammar and syntax is okay. Short or long-term. I'm in CST but I'm a night owl. \n\nI prefer original worlds and storylines, and horror, supernatural/paranormal, low/urban/science fantasy genres. Aside from my love of villains, other things I love are: unhealthy relationships, wide-eyed ingenues, neo/gothic horror, intricately-built worlds, ancient magic, innocence corrupted, alien moralities, Faustian bargains, bad things happening to good people, misunderstood and not-so-misunderstood monsters. I also have an undying love for vampires and the fair folk. \n\nIf it sounds like this is the kinda RP you've been jonesing for, DM me with a lil bit about you/what you're looking for and we'll go from there. If this is still up, I'm still looking.",

The drama, the twists, the heartbreaks. Along with anything else should the prompt suit it. And of course, with romance and whatnot, if it fits and all that. *As for myself, and hopefully for you too, I'm happy to play multiple characters or DM too!*\nAn odd but optional request, would be that any partners willing to play out scenes as humans on occasion would much appreciated!\nAs for the types of stories that I'd be willing to play out, I'm up for almost anything. \u25cb\n\n\u2022Fantasy. (*I have done fantasy ideas to death, so if you come by with one, I likely won't be interested! I'm willing to do them if they stand out/are unique.*)\n\n\u2022Sci-fi.\n\n\u2022Modern.\n\n\u2022Post-Apocalyptic. Zombies, Nuclear, etc.\n\n\u2022Amongst many more. \n\n\u2022Fandom based RPs are also plus, taking place within an already established canon with those characters, or some mix. Games, movies, **especially anime**, etc. \n\n\u25cf If you've found yourself interested, then do message me!

            "selftext": "Hello there!\n\nI am currently searching for long term RP partners for some interesting RPs.\n\nA little bit about me:\n\nI am a 20 year old female with about 7 or 8 years of experience and even longer writing experience (~9 or 10). \n\nEST time zone\n\nI RP third person and my responses range anywhere from a paragraph to even a page depending on what is happening in the RP.  (I also do try to match responses) \n\nIf for some reason you grow bored or disinterested please do let me know and we can fix it or try something else completely. \n\nI love chatting outside of RP whether it be about our characters, future plot points, coming up with characters in AU\u2019s or just general chat! Although if that\u2019s not your thing then no worries!\n\nI do have a full time job and have responsibilities after so my responses may be dependent. Often times it can get a bit overwhelming so I apologize if my responses get a bit spotty here and there.\n\nFor fandom RPs, I can do canon and OC characters (although I am more used to canon), and I can play both males and females. I also love to RP multiple characters (more plot devices and interaction that way after all!) Character interaction, development, and world building is a must! I love building things to it\u2019s full potential. \n\nAlso, I do quite enjoy looking at characters from different angles even if that means switching between character POV in the RP, but if you\u2019re more of a one or two character interaction type of person that\u2019s fine, but I certainly don\u2019t mind playing side characters or extras to bring the world to life.\n\nSome games I have played: (I am perfectly fine to play against an OC for any of these!) \n\nI will put asterisks next to ones I am inspired for or that I know the most about.\n\nUndertale\n\nDetroit: Become Human *** \n\u2014&gt; I can play any of the canon characters but at the moment I am most interested in a Gavin and RK900, and I could settle for anything with Hank and Connor even including an OC if you preferred as well. \n\nSpider-Man (PS4 2018) \n\u2014&gt; Canon\n\nFinal Fantasy (4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10-2, 13, 13-2, 13-3, 15 and Kingsglaive, Dissidia, Crisis Core) \n\u2014&gt; I can play any of the canon characters from these as well! \n\nTales (Berseria, Xillia, and Graces f) \n\nLegend of Zelda (MM, TP, WW, SS, BOTW) **\n\u2014&gt; Canon or OC\n\nTelltales The Walking Dead \n\nFire Emblem (Awakening, Warriors, Fates)\n\u2014&gt; Almost any of the canon\n\n\n\nShows/movies:\n\nMarvel\n\u2014&gt; most movies including Spiderverse and also daredevil, not so much comics \n\nSherlock * \n\u2014&gt; Canon\n\nMiraculous LB *\n\u2014&gt; Canon or OC \n\nRWBY \n\u2014&gt; Canon or OC \n\nSword Art Online Arc 1 &amp; 2 (more the universe)\n\nSword Art Online Season 2 (more the universe)\n\nStranger Things (Haven\u2019t finished it completely yet)\n\nLucifer (Haven\u2019t finished it completely yet)\n\n\n**Not a complete list of fandoms**\n\nBooks:\n\nPercy Jackson\nThe Chronicles Of Nick\nWarriors\nMaximum Ride\nAntigoddess *\nBeautiful Creatures\n\n\n\nOriginal ideas I enjoy:\n\n\u2014Fantasy (medieval, magical elements, kingdoms, different races, even adding in tech like airships, modern weapons, and exploring more than one and a variety of aspects as well. There\u2019s so much more I could add but it would take forever.)\n\u2014\u2014&gt; war themes, royal themes, different aspects of life themes\n\n\u2014Romance (MxF and possibly FxF and I don\u2019t do smut. More of a fade to black sort of person) I also thoroughly enjoy building it up over time rather than it simply happening! \n\n\u2014Action/Adventure\n\n\u2014Angst/Drama\n\nI am sure there are more things I am forgetting. \n\nI would be fine exploring any other sorts of themes/plots genres except Sci-Fi and Slice of life (normal themes would need some convincing as I find it difficult to keep it going) as I like some sort of magical or fictional aspect to it. \n\nIf you have any other suggestions/ideas/plots/settings as to what you would like to do then please shoot me a PM with a bit about you and your interests and we can discuss! Give me a bit about your interests and preferences! I am open to nearly anything!\n\nIf you need a sample of my writing, please do not be afraid to ask! \n\nMy platforms are Kik, Discord, Skype, Email, Google Docs and Reddit PM",

            "selftext": "Hello! I'm Tanghost (I think, it is my 'display name' here on reddit). I'm 19- soon 20 years old and I'm looking for some people to come up with a fun plot- and potentially world if we decide to go for a genre instead of a fandom. I love making characters and usually create a new one for each roleplay unless I think one of my already-existing ones will fit our plot and/or your character. Also as the title says- I'm not just looking for people to roleplay with, I'd love it if we can talk OOC, come up with headcanons and maybe also share some art with each other! I'll list some of my preferences and stuff below- **just skim through them if you don't feel like reading this stuff up here.** \n\nI only do:\n\n* **MxF** stories, where I play the male character. They don't have to be romantic- platonic relationships can be just as fun with a good plot/story!\n*  **Multiple Paragraphs.** I usually write around 300\\~ words for each reply- As long you're not giving me 2 sentence long paragraphs it'll be fine. \n* **Literate.** Please be able to speak at least as well as I can- I'm not perfect, I know that since I don't even come from an English speaking country but I still have some standards. \n* **3rd person.** This one I can be convinced to do otherwise, it is still a huge preference of mine though.\n* **OC.** This is a massive must, playing with OCs make the stories feel much more like our own, don't they? Also for fandoms a requirement is that we come up with our own stories in that world- we can still use the same locations but \n\nAs for the things I won't do I'm pretty open to most stuff and genres, you can just ask me- don't be shy! The things I'm looking to do right now though is either a **Fantasy &amp; Romance** story or a **Romance story in a fandom**. Some fandoms I'm open to doing- **MHA/BNHA, One Piece, Naruto.** As you can see there are only 3 fandoms- and they are all anime... This is not everything I'm looking to do though! If you have a genre you really want to play (**except apocalypse or any really dark story**) I'd love to hear about it!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think that's about it- I might've forgotten something, but I can't remember if I did. All that remains is for you to maybe send me a **DM** here on reddit! You can put your discord username in the dm and we can talk more over there. But please state your favorite animal in the subject so I know you read at least this last part. Okay then, I hope I'll see from some of you! Bye and thanks for reading this post!",

            "selftext": "I am an experienced, advanced literate cis female writer looking for a female (NB and non-cis individuals also welcome) long-term writing partner interested in filling the male roles in the narratives we dream up and to help me create worlds and breathe life into characters that we fall irreparably in love with. I want depth and beauty and drama and writing so delicious you could die. I'm not asking for much, just that special magic that can happen rarely when two talented minds meet a blank page and tackle it together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Come wander with me through worlds of our own making.\n\n# \n\nI am going to try and keep this as brief as possible while still offering as much information as I can so you can decide whether or not you think we'd mesh well before shooting me a PM.  &lt;3 **Bolded big stuff so you can skim, though**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# \u2661 7/6/19 -  UPDATED CRAVINGS/IDEA SNIPPETS SECTION.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Also please don't comment here, PM me if you want to communicate about anything written below.**\n\n# \u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\n\n# The big compatibility stuff/my preferences:\n\n**\u2661** I have been doing RP/one on one writing in some capacity or another for **\\~19 years**. It's why I can write to what I humbly believe to be at least a **somewhat decent** level. Being able to write every single day for months on end for more years of my life than not has given me invaluable experience in character creation, development, world building, narrative, all of it.\n\n**\u2661** I mention this because I would very much prefer it if you are also on the more **advanced literate** side of literate in your writing. I ask that you are fairly experienced, with a firm grasp of spelling, grammar, and storytelling. I **don't** ask that you be perfect, I am a **better storyteller** than I am at grammar and punctuation and all that, tbh and as a warning. I'm gonna make glaring mistakes because the words were just rushing out too fast and I was blinded by the vision of the scene and the things I was trying to convey, but I do try my best.\n\nAll that to say again, we're both human, perfection isn't being sought here, but just write good, k?\n\n**\u2661** **I prefer female writing partners.** NB and non-cis individuals **of course** also welcome. Basically, as long as you weren't socialized as male, we'll likely get along. And I actually get along great with bi men as well, so you're welcome also. I'm sure that's putting all the str8 cis-dudes reading this right into their feelings, and that's fine, I get it, but this is my preference. I don't care to hear your thoughts on it. The answer is \"No, thank you.\" But best of luck to you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- **TLDR: If you're not a straight dude and you want to write the male roles in our stories, and enjoy those roles, PM me!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\u2661** I do **only** play female main characters, and I understand if that is frustrating to you, but that is also my preference. If you don't enjoy playing the main male roles, **do not PM me**. I'm not about asking anyone to do anything they don't want to do. If you don't want to...please don't.\n\n**\u2661** I type much more **casually** in direct conversation via IM/DM, I **overshare** and brainstorm ideas constantly and will flood your messages if you're away with them.\n\n**\u2661** I am **only** interested in **hetero** pairings for our mains.\n\n**\u2661** From time to time I may be interested in F/F pairings of side characters or side characters with my main, and this is about as close to \"doubling\" as I get. This is not a requirement, however. Just something I am open to if it fits the story and both parties are interested.\n\n**\u2661** I prefer **GDocs/E-mail** for the actual writing and **Discord** for ooc chatter and brainstorming. I will bow to pressure if you ONLY use discord servers and you seem like a good potential partner, but I **don't** love the character limitations on there.\n\n**\u2661** I **\\*really\\*** am not comfortable working with anyone younger than around **\\~22+** Like, I have **zero** interest and it'll be a flat **no** from me. Sorry.\n\n**\u2661** I don't know if this is a given, but I also ask that you **help** me populate the **side-characters** as needed for our world and our stories.\n\n**\u2661** I **do not** match **post length** just for the sake of it. I will always try and give as much as I possibly can in a post, but if we need to advance forward, or the post for whatever reason didn't give me a ton to work with or it's mainly dialogue, my reply will be shorter.\n\n**\u2661** **I do not like pre-made characters**. I expect that **all** characters used in our stories are made expressly for those stories.\n\n**\u2661** I write in **third person past-tense POV only**.\n\n**\u2661** I **only** use actors and models for **character references**, and I consider character references **necessary**.\n\n**\u2661** **Please** include your **NSFW** preferences in your **introductory PM**. **\u2661**\n\n**\u2661** SO yeah, just to make it a bullet point, I prefer **long-term** writing partners. We can certainly do **one-offs** for cravings, and leave and come back to stories and worlds and plots as we please, we are after all in charge, but I prefer to have one or two steady people I can turn to when I want to work on something either creatively for a few months or to satisfy a craving in the moment that may or may not turn into something long-term we work on or come back to, and to be that person for someone else as well.\n\n**\u2661** **Please don't invite me to your group role-plays**. \u2661 Thanks so much for the thought and I am flattered but I am only interested in one on one stuff for now. The most I would consider is maybe occasionally working together with a third party if you wanted to bring one in on discord someday or something like that. That could be fun, but I don't do group stuff.\n\n**\u2661** I **don't** tend to like playing **canon characters**. I will take ideas from characters and build something new around that, something similar, but still mine. I will also do this with settings, worlds, drawing from TV and movies and comics and books, etc. But I will never play a canon character and for me to play opposite one, as in you playing a canon character, would have to be a huge crave or a lot of convincing and pretense and plot that I like. It's rare, but not 100% unprecedented. (I was DYING for a Punisher RP as soon as season one on Netflix came out, for example.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Take a look at what I am interested in actually writing just below, and if you find your interest piqued further and want to delve into any of these worlds with me and create some characters, get right into it and start brainstorming and seeing if we vibe, please send me a PM. Introduce yourself. If you have writing samples, send them. If you have questions, ask them. Ideas? Tell me them. \u2661\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# On the subject of prompts/cravings:\n\n**This used to be more populated and offered better descriptions of what I had in mind, however, I have been having issues with getting posts pulled so I have had to revamp this. If you think we would mesh well together, inquire about ideas I have in your introductory PM and we can discuss and I can elaborate.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The amount of \u2661's denote level of interest.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661 RDR/The Revenant/Western US in the mid to late 1800s**  \\- The overall gist is pretty simple, delving into a love story set in the wild west, but I think this could be really fun and amazing if we slapped some good writing on it. We'd be dabbling in some historical fiction, which I love, and using OC's. I mention the specific media examples listed as reference for vibe/setting only, though I am certainly not opposed to borrowing themes from any source. I'd be interested in maybe doing something with a band of outlaws a la RDR2, maybe trappers a la The Revenant. We could eventually have some homesteading, and there's a lot of room for action and drama and slice of life elements all mixed in together, and for some more robust side-characters if we choose to develop them. I'm on my second playthrough of RDR2 and it's so immersive and expansive that I can't help but be inspired and want to reflect that in a story all our own. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661 Fiona Gallagher/Shameless  (US) -** I would like to create a character who is a lot like Fiona in her situation with being responsible for her siblings and household. I'd ideally pair her with a wealthy older guy, or a Jimmy-Steve sort of guy around her age, but without all the dishonesty and secrets. If you haven't watched this show, my idea is also easily explained as it has nothing to do with the actual show and I just want to borrow the overall premise and make it our own.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\u2661\u2661\u2661 Sci-Fi** \\- I have several ideas for the many directions this could go. Something set in space or another planet will likely  be my main interest. Colonists, scientists, explorers, etc. but of course with a love story at center.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIdeas would of course need to be developed a lot more, but I truly love that kind of collaborative development of plot and characters, so that's fine by me. I prefer to leave things as more of a loose skeleton without fleshing everything as far as plot and narrative out tooooo much, because I like for the characters to kind of help to illuminate the way as we go. **Brainstorming and sharing ideas is great, plotting things to death and down to the very last detail isn't much fun for me though.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# \u2661 No matter what kind of world and characters we work in and with, I want a heavy, character-driven, unforgivably human type of story that will ultimately reward us with a beautiful narrative and characters that feel real and alive. Hopefully a friendship and/or writing partnership. Maybe the start of a whole new world we can dabble and play in at our leisure. That's always my hope.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want beauty and heartache and drama and love and yeah, I want a little magic but not in the fantasy sense of the word. I want the magic of two creative, talented minds working together for a common goal and breathing life with words. I want a nice slow to medium-burn of a love story to start out hopefully many lovely stories we can tell together. There are universes to be made.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have characters already kind of fleshed out a bit in my mind and some ideas for side characters and plot and backstory and such for the craves listed here, depending on what your character is like and what we decide of course on for the tone and plot. I want some elements of slice of life, but forward-driving plot at a decent pace. I write with as much depth, detail, and color as I possibly can but sometimes it will be more casual, sometimes it will be really lengthy, just depending on mood.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**If any of this sounds good to you, please don't hesitate to PM me and we can go from there. Most of the above can be worked out.**\n\n# \u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\n\n# Bonus rambling:\n\n\u2661 Usually having the male main character at least a couple of years older than the character I am playing will end up being my vibe. I like to make female characters that challenge and assert against men who might consciously or unconsciously use age as an excuse to dismiss or otherwise silence or stifle them at the beginning, or if they're not the type sometimes also perhaps to use that juxtaposition of age and character for fun because of some of these societally pre-conceived notions, etc.\n\n\u2661 Taking breaks for burnout is totally fine, I will probably take a couple over the course of say, a year, and that's why I prefer having long-term partners. Ditching though, I don't appreciate and try not to do myself. Just let me know, I get it. We're human beings with lives and mental and physical health needs. Or maybe we just aren't meshing? Don't sweat it, just tell me. I will certainly try and do the same.\n\n\u2661 I can get **very** into world, mood and character building and have in the past collaborated on playlists, character references, setting reference, mood boards, etc. with writing partners to help expand on the world based on the mood, using these things as a way to further get on the same page so we can write in both the same tone and from the closest that I think two minds can probably get when working on one world together from two totally different upbringings, sometimes writing styles, background, history, experience, mood, locations in the world, etc. There are a lot of variables, but I feel like discussing characters and setting and vibes and themes you want to include and songs that make you think of a character or a moment or a feeling related to the story and all of that can level some of those variables and bring two people to the same place creatively. It's magic when it happens, and if you've experienced it you know it, and I guess that's what I am looking for again. A little magic, no big deal. Right?\n\n\u2661 I like to tell stories that can sometimes span generations. Maybe even time and space. But most important, stories about families and characters that feel real and who come to life for us. I like having things that I write with long-term writing partners eventually be woven together in some way or another, so that it's a cohesive world, even if in one story we're dabbling in Science Fiction and then in another maybe historical fiction or slice of life or anything in-between. I love doing stuff like that and being collaborative about world building and borrowing characters and adding generations and ancestors and relatives to families as we go and as the opportunity arises no matter the genre or era we are writing in. I've yet to meet a plot line I can't at least loosely tie together.",

I\u2019m looking to do a small highschool RP, and with some romance into the mix. The world of it can be full of creatures, from nagas to avian races.\n\nIf we could, maybe a quiet girl and a punk or bad girl falling for each other, or something of the like. We can do anything you like, however. I'm open to ideas!\n\nI'd like to play this out with a longterm partner, stretching from a humble start to a blossoming relationship for our two characters.\n\nI prefer to do the RP in Reddit PMs, mostly due to I don't really have any other outlets. I can play in first or third person, whichever you prefer. I will end up writing up to one paragraph, yet I can do longer depending on the setting. No one-liners, as I will not respond.\n\nHave a good one, hope to see you soon! =D",

One day the village is raided by Vikings. Her father instructed her to hide and wait out the fight, but she\u2019s discovered after the fight is over. She put up a fight, trying to save maybe another girl or children, or a member of her family, and therefore the Vikings who found her are going to put her to death. That\u2019s when your character comes in. He likes her boldness and courage, and takes her as his wife. She\u2019s not happy about this, but knows it is this or the chopping block. Eventually they grow to love each other.\n\nWe can discuss further details in reddit pms. Looking forward to hearing from you!",

I'm okay with any combination of the two genres. \n\nI already have a few scenarios in mind, but I narrowed it down to a main plot for roleplay. If you like it, I'd love to roleplay it with you, but if you have other ideas I'd love to hear them! Here's an rundown of the plot I had in mind:\n\n-Akemi has lived next to you for a few weeks now. He Only came to school once, though dissapeared after quickly becoming the subject of harsh bullying. He's never really caught your interest before that, but the kid is somewhat mysterious. And you are decently acquainted with his sister, but strangely enough she rarely ever mentions him. She herself is an outcast; always alone, quiet, considered a 'weird kid'. And even her parents seem to be crazy religious. This family seems off to you, though it's hard to explain or find out what's wrong. Maybe approaching his sister is the closest you'll get to answers.-\n\nThough this is not the most interesting starter, there's an underlying problems and hidden secrets behind this story that make it far more interesting. If you want to try this or another horror scenario, let me know!",

I just think it adds a nice layer to the RP. I would like for us to play as celebs or models.\nAnyways here are my scenarios \n\nOne we could do is about a queen that has an affair with the stable boy. The king is abusive and wants an heir, but cannot produce it, so the queen turns to the stable boy and they start a daring affair. \n\nAnother, I move out the house and into a cabin. The cabin however is haunted, by you, and after a few misunderstandings we fall in love. \n\nWe could also do one about an apocalypse. We are two survivors that found each other and we are just trying to get through it. It can be any type of apocalypse, zombie, nuclear, weather disaster, anything! \n\nAnd finally I would love to have a high school reunion RP,  where we both play multiple characters! The bully, the slut, the nerd, the teacher etc I picture this as sort of a rom com\n\nI am looking for someone descriptive. I want to make this RP as romantic and smutty as possible.\nPlease tell me which prompt interests you and if you have any ideas of your own I would love to hear them! \nPlease message me here on Reddit to get my Kik! \nI am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+",

I'm a long-time roleplayer, always on the look-out for new partners, new scenes, and new ideas to explore, as long as they involve gay romance between a manly, rugged man (played by my partner) and a softer, delicate one (played by me).\n\nA roleplay with me will be a creative, detailed slice-of-life experience, with plenty of introductory brainstorming and worldbuilding. I'm mainly oriented towards realistic settings, but can enjoy highly creative themes such as fantasy, sci-fi or dystopian.\n\nAs an example, picture this scene:\n\n&gt;A rugged bluecollar, still in his worksuit, is sitting at the counter of a gay bar, during a Friday evening. His wife recently divorced on him, leaving with the kids, yet he still wears his wedding ring. In spite of considering himself straight, he's always felt an attraction towards men he had to suppress, but now it's different. Spurred by the hardships of this unexpected turn in his life, the man decided to come here, and now awkwardly sits, drinking a beer. Imagine the surprise in my character's face when the burly stranger will offer him a drink, explaining he's not really used to picking up gays, asking if he's supposed to approah them like he would a woman.\n\n# A final note\n\nI can share my **Discord** or link us to a **Google Doc**, where we'll be able to have an instant messaging conversation and exchange creative ideas.\n\nI'm fluent in English, but it's worth mentioning that I'm Italian and I'd be glad to roleplay in my native language if an Italian user comes by.\n\nLooking forward to your messages :3\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[*I'm an adult/18+ in real life, I'm looking for a partner who is an adult/18+ in real life, everything discussed is fantasy.*\\]",

Preferably I would like to loosely follow the plot in the games but since we all know how bad the ending was I'd also like to mix and change things into something of our own. I don't mind original characters added in nor do I mind giving some side characters more spotlight if there's some minor character you fell in love with, it's all fine by me! I would really like to include all of the crew although obviously some would have smaller roles than others. I might also be interested in post me3 plot but that would need some careful planning. I do have some ideas in mind though!\n\n As far as romance goes, I must admit I'm mostly used to mxm but I can try fxm and fxf as well. Especially if I can write Shepard. Pairings I'm mainly interested in:\n\n\n\nShepard/Garrus\n\nShepard/Thane \n\n\n\n\nI am fairly active and on good days I can do multiple replies, sometimes it's just one or two. It depends on my work but I will always let you know! So, if you're over 20 and comfortable with multiple characters please pm me!",

I have been in quite a few roleplay groups and have recently had an idea that could possibly help with some of the drama that I see in quite a few. \n\nA lot of people get jealous over relationships and that\u2019s where I have a new twist on my server. Within the story you are allowed one character and when you turn into a vampire you are \u201cmated\u201d to one person and one person only. \n\nIf you\u2019re found to be talking to multiple others then you\u2019re banned no questions asked. \n\nNow onto the story.\n\nAries Haylean was just another farmer during the rule of Caeser. That was until the assassination of him. He remembered the day well. He was just starting to return home from a hard day of work whenever he heard the screams of the villagers. Running through the fields now instead of enjoying his time with a leisurely stroll. However he was still too late. He saw the black clad figures collapse upon his family ripping the organs which had one supported the lives of those he had loved straight from their throats. Instantly being engulfed in anger he gripped the sickle and started running towards the fight however just as soon as he was about to find himself in the midst of them all went black.\n\nAwaking he put a hand to his head and even though his vision swam he saw a man sitting not too far away from him. Dressed in red he raised what appeared to a glass of wine but the viscosity of it was wrong... different somehow. He was just about to ask when the man raised an eyebrow and pointed towards the cup.\n\n\u201cOh ? This ? It\u2019s blood you silly thing.\u201d\n\nAries didn\u2019t know what to think of this man except fear. He had tried to run but the man placed a hand on his thigh and dragged him back towards him.\n\n\u201cOh no no I have a plan for you...\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in joining just let me know! It\u2019s still a work in progress but I have seen way too many discord\u2019s fall and as such would be hosting numerous public events and would have a hard admin presence making sure everyone felt comfortable where they were.",

I was wondering if I could possibly interest you in a literate, scifi GxG, based on Modern-Day Earth. \n\nFor millions of years, an ancient machine hive mind known as \u201cthe contingency\u201d was believed to be destroyed, wiped out by a defensive galaxy full of other advanced civilizations. All but one, Nekro-67, one of the Contingency\u2019s several control hubs, ejected into space during the Contingency\u2019s defeat at the young star known as \u201cBetelgeuse\u201d. Since being ejected from the Contingency citadel, Nekro had floated aimlessly in space as a lone capsule, offline as her race was slowly destroyed. \n\nBut as the years passed, the civilizations involved in the war slowly faded away with the arrow of time, and only monuments remained. But for Nekro, her reactivation was just beginning, as it drifted into the gravity influence of Earth, a blue marble of 70% ocean, and inhabited by 8 billion humans. \n\nThe capsule sensors immediately scanning life on the planet, the capsule  using its moments worth of fuel to begin a descent towards the surface, on a trajectory to crash straight into the Colorado mountains. But it didn\u2019t matter, for Nekro had only one mission. Find a suitable overmind, obey, and rebuild an empire.\n\nDo PM me if this interests you.",

If you haven\u2019t read it you should! It\u2019s very good very similar vibe to Midsommar. Anywho! Inspiration struck and now...\n\nWhat I\u2019m looking to write:\n\nAn old world European closed society horror story. pagan traditions, folksy, homespun vibes, dark and malevolent under current. \n\nI\u2019d like most explicitly unsettling scenes to happen off camera. Personally I find the dread of terror to be dulled by physical/emotional violence so if we choose to put something on scene I\u2019d like it to be impactful. \n\nI anticipate the real MC are going to be the society/town, not individual people in them\n\nI\u2019m open to writing either outsiders or people who are a part of the society. \n\nThis world/idea is still incubating so if it sounds interesting and you\u2019d like to build out the world with me, shoot me a message, poke around, ask questions! \n\nThanks!",

            "selftext": " Hey there! I\u2019m \\[REDACTED\\], one of the co-owners of Persona: Labyrinthine of Sin!\n\nOur server has recently opened up, and we are looking for new members to fill up our Persona roleplay server! Now, one may wonder to themselves that if Persona only has 7-9 protagonists who use personas, and the rest are average joes, how will this roleplay be entertaining for everyone? Well, you see, in the Labyrinthine, EVERYONE gets a Persona. There are three factions within the server, each of which has 10 slots (we will raise the slots if we gain a lot of attention).\n\nThese are the three factions for you to choose from!\n\n* **The Trailblazers:** These are essentially the main protagonists of any Persona game. While they are most likely the easiest choice to make a character for, they also start at a disadvantage since when the campaign starts, this group still does not have their Personas.\n* **The Labyrinthine Investigation Unit (AKA LIU):** This group is a branch of the \u7279\u6b8a\u4f5c\u6226\u7fa4 (Tokushusakusengun), which is essentially the Special Forces of Japan. They are composed of veteran Persona users, all of which have had their Personas for a few years at this point in the story. These individuals have worked together on other \u201csupernatural\u201d phenomenon relating to Personas and Shadows. LIU is going into the Labyrinth to learn how it was created, who exactly created, is it a danger to humanity, and if so, can it be destroyed?\n* **Faction Three (Unnamed):** This group is currently unnamed, as the members of the group will vote on a name for it before the campaign starts. This group was made by the main antagonist of the story (Nev Urey) to act as guardians of her Labyrinth. This group was intentionally composed of individuals with low morals, as Nev Urey wants them to do whatever she asks of them, be it capturing LIU members for a sacrifice, or slaughtering the Trailblazers.\n\nNow, you are probably wondering to yourself two things: Why on Earth are people going to this place, and why am I now referring to it as a campaign and not a roleplay when earlier I was calling it a roleplay? Both questions have relatively simple answers. For the first question, Nev Urey has promised The Trailblazers that there is an item at the top (she did not specify what it was, she only said they\u2019d know it when they see it) which can grant them one wish of any proportion\u2026and she told Faction Three the same thing. While Faction Three is supposed to be guarding her Labyrinth, she also promised them that if they make it to the top before The Trailblazers, she\u2019d grant them the same wish. As for the second question, this roleplay is a roleplay, but it\u2019s also a campaign! It is largely story based with a focus on EVERYONE\u2019S characters, but we have an actual combat system that we have spent quite a while creating so that way combat won\u2019t be too easy due to anyone being allowed to do whatever.\n\nIf this short introduction to the server gained your interest, I ask you to check out the server itself! You have absolutely nothing to lose by checking it out, and if you like what you see you can always stay and fill out an application!\n\n[Click here to be taken to the Labyrinthine of Sin!](https://discord.gg/7my2qcS)",

            "selftext": "Hello all! I've decided to go on a hunt for some roleplay partners. First, a bit about myself. \n\nI am a 20 year old girl who loves to create characters of all kinds and act out roleplays that are funny, romantic, and worth the time invested. While I do have my moments of business or tiredness, I am pretty free most the time. I roleplay in 3rd Person and my personal favorite genres are slice of life and/or modern fantasy mixed with romance. I'm not too picky on length but my comfort zone is 2-15+ lines depending on my level of creativity and how much the other person puts out. I do prefer LGBT roleplays although I can do straight roleplays. I prefer our characters to be able to change out on the who wears the pants role or for me to be the lesser pants wearer. Most of my characters are less masculine  or ambiguous. EST Time Zone.\nNow onto preferences for my partner. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMUSTS: \n\nMust be willing and able to have or create a decently fleshed out character. I have a character template that I use for my ocs if you need one. Character tropes are fine, although I take some issue with some but as long as they go beyond that trope and are their own person beyond 1 or 2 character traits, they're fine!\n\nMust have decent grammar and spelling. Now I know nobody's grammar or spelling is perfect, but I need to be able to understand what you're typing. \n\nMust reply at least every other day. I understand being busy and having times where you can't reply for a few days but id like to be notified if and when those things happen. I usually wait 4-7 days for someone to reply and will send the occasional 'hi' or 'hey' as a reminder. (Note: I also encourage you to be annoying to get me to reply. Sometimes I get distracted to the point of forgetting to reply or Discord won't send my reply or won't notify me when you reply. Send me reminders. If I ghost you it's never on purpose.) \n\nMUST NOT GHOST. I get being busy or even not wanting to roleplay with me. LET ME KNOW. So many people tend to ghost  when They get busy or dont want to tell me that they're not feeling me or the roleplay. Tell me. That way I know and can have a little closure. \n\nHave Discord.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEXTRA POINTS IF (you do not have to share these but it helps if you do)\n\nYou roleplay LGBT\n\nYou like multiple RPs, multiple characters to be going on at once (I LOVE polyamory)\n\nYou like talking and developing the RP as its happening\n\nYou are okay with rping as/with ocs who are mentally ill or physically disabled in some way. \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSend me a message telling me about you, what you like/don't like in a roleplay, and if you hit any of the extra points!  If you messaged me and I didn't answer I was probably busy! Feel free to Send me another message! I look forward to role-playing with you!! Please send the keyphrase \"Don't ask Don't Pas-tell\" somewhere in your message so I know you read through everything!",

            "selftext": "*^((We'll try this again and see if a second attempt proves to bear more fruit.))*\n\nGreetings, all,\n\nI am looking to partner with an individual who is comfortable working within the constraints of a fantasy-based theme of sorts.  \n\nIdeally, this venture would combine the best of several different magic-systems (*Avatar*'s 'bending,' and *D&amp;D/Harry Potter*'s spell variants), as well grand, world-based adventuring as presented in any number of *D&amp;D* campaigns; something similar to world-based 'fetch' quests such as those represented in *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,* or *The Hobbit*.\n\nBasically, the story needs some sort of forward-moving, driving force to keep it from becoming rooted in one place for too long, wherein the seeds of destruction and disinterest can fester and flourish.\n\nThe world I'm hoping to build would include its fair share of exotic and varied denizens: Elves, tieflings, and orcs, just to name a few of the otherworldly beings intertwining their existences with those of the mundane and rampantly overused in most Euro-centric works of fiction.  Because, really, *why* would you write as a bland, unmotivated Human when you could try something so much more nuanced, challenging, and-- more importantly-- *interesting*.  ;D\n\nAs with all of my previous posts, I would ask that anyone whose interests I've piqued [peruse the attached document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NB0lwdANbuL8zNsw2OgI9Mjo95koRMIbPU_pDbxMs4k/edit?usp=sharing) **prior** to contacting me.  Due to the nature of my work, and what hours I have at my disposal for personal ventures, I do not have the time, nor the patience to field flighty, partially interested applications.  I would rather devote the majority of my time to world-building and brainstorming with someone who gleans as much pleasure from writing as myself rather than fruitlessly perusing the boards, sifting through the bulk to find that one like-minded individual who is desirous of the same things.\n\nI simply know what I want, and am unwilling to settle for anything less.  I'm sure you can understand as much.\n\nWith all that being said, please don't hesitate to contact me if you are at all interested in any of the aforementioned.  I am well-aware that my request-threads can come off rather... *intimidating*, but it is an unintended byproduct of being highly motivated to create something instead of malicious weeding of those less committed to their craft.\n\nIf you've made it to the end of my rambling, thank you sincerely for taking the time to read this.  I hope to hear from you, but I wish you the best of luck in finding your own ideal partner should you find my requirements too restrictive for your liking.\n\nBest wishes to you all, and happy writing!\n\nCheers,\n\n\\-Izu.",

It would be more of a casual story, and how celestial beings exist amongst us humans. \n\nThe plot may or may not be a cliche, the good old fallen angels. I think the story could go two different ways, depending if my character is aware of her supernal roots or not. \n\nMy character stays true to the myth that angels do not have a gender - therefore she's got both male and female parts. But she still identities as a woman.\n\nMore of her personality and general backstory will be revealed depending on what kind of path the story starts at, and how the story rolls.\n\nIf you're interested, don't be shy to shoot me a PM! I'd rather do the roleplay via discord since I check it more often. But PMs are fine too.\n\nThanks for reading this far! &lt;3",

This could be following the events of the movie, or we could create our own little universe! I love to write, and I enjoy worldbuilding and story quite a lot. I'm also more than okay with playing as some other Marvel characters, such as; Frank Castle, Luke Cage, Matt Murdock, Steve Rogers, Danny Rand, Bucky Barnes, T'Challa, etc. \n\nAnother roleplay I would absolutely love is a Star Wars style roleplay, with me playing Starkiller from the Star Wars: The Force Unleashed series. I don't have any preference as to what characters I write alongside, so I'm open to anything, really.\n\nI'm based in the East coast, as such my time zone is EST but I can compromise with any time zones and usually am able to get out two replies, but most likely more. \n\n(I'd like any and all roleplays to be a balance between story and smut, and also include other NSFW themes.)",

Be able to play multiple characters. \n5. This prompt may be cross posted. \n\nHave you ever been reading and really gotten into the book?  I mean to the point where you feel as though you are an actual sentient observer within your chosen established universe and you have to choose whether to keep your knowledge of the future of the series a secret from the story's inhabitants, or try to change the story to save someone or something worth saving? It was just a few weeks ago and I started re-reading the Harry Potter series for the 9 3/4 time, and after finishing the Deathly Hallows while ugly crying (again), I fell into the deepest of sleeps. \n\n\nWhen I woke up, I was in the hospital wing of Hogwarts.  I had a bandage on my head and a very kind eyed woman looking over me.  \"Oh good heavens, you're awake!\" she smiled.  \"That was quite a hit to the head.  It was as though you literally just dropped from the sky.  You're very lucky that the train had just pulled in and there was someone there to get you here quickly.\"\n\nHer accent was undeniably English, but where was I? \"Excuse me, ma'am, but where am I?\" she seems surprised at my American (southern, at that!) accent.  \n\n\"Well, my dear, you're at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  I've never seen you before, so I assumed you were a first year.\" Her face turned slightly as she brought over some water and soup.  \"Eat up, dear.  I'm going to go let the Headmaster know that you're alright.  He'll probably want to talk to you.  In the meantime, the W.C. is to the left right there, but you should try to stay in bed.\"\n\n\"Thank you, ma'am,\" I say as my head spins and I begin to eat.  \n\n\nI finish some delicious stew and my water before falling asleep again.  When my eyes open, I see a kind, older gentleman with a beard and a pointed had sitting beside me with a book in hand.  I rub my eyes, sure that I've lost my mind.  \"Excuse me, but are you... no.. there's no way you could be, right?  This is just a dream,\" I shake my head.  \"I'm just a muggle from a muggle world where there is no tangible magic and my wand is merely a decorative item... not a real wand, right?\"\n\nThe man suddenly has a very bemused smile on his face.  \"Perhaps we should start at the beginning, and take our time so as to not overwhelm you,\" his eyes seem to have a spark in them.  \"I am Headmaster Albus Dumbledore and you are at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  You fell quite suddenly from the heavens and landed on some cobblestone, hitting your head.\"\n\n\nI begin a lengthy conversation that takes hours upon hours telling Dumbledore of my home, our world, that their entire universe exists as a story.  Everything.  I even find that my personal custom made wand is in its sheath on my waist, as though I'd been ready to cosplay.  He asks me if I can do any spells.  After emphasizing that there is no magic core in my wand, I go through the ones from the poster on my wall.  Lumos, Nox, Wingardium Leviosa, Reparo... I'm shocked at how well I appear to be doing.  I'm actually using real magic. For real.  I tell him we know of the unforgivable curses, how to summon a patronus, and events that haven't yet transpired.\n\nHe smiles and laughs.  \"Well, I think that is an excellent start.  I can't tell you what to do with your exceptional knowledge, but I can tell that you are extraordinary.  We'll tell the students that you are our first ever student from America.  We'll get you sorted and I'll send Hagrid off to get you your school supplies at my expense.  You appear to be twelve years old, based on Madame Pomfrey's assessment.  That would put you in our first year class.  There are two days left before classes begin, so we can get you oriented.\"\n\nI nod.  \"Thank you, very much.  I'm very good with animals where I'm from. I really can't wait until Norbert hatches,\" I blurt out.  Dumbledore laughs.  \n\n\"You mean the egg that Hagrid came back from Diagon Alley with?\" he winks.  \"I know pretty much everything that goes on here.  I'll be sure to inform him of your interest in creatures.  Now, what do you say we sort you?\" Dumbledore grabs the Sorting Hat from a nearby table and sits it upon my head.  For nearly thirty minutes the hat and I go back and forth about which house to put me in.\n\n\n\"You're a Slytherin.  You are everything Slytherin house exemplifies.  You know it. I know it,\" I hear the hat say.\n\n\"But I'm muggle born.  I'm a muggle for all intents and purposes.  You really think Slytherin is the best place for someone like me?\" I argue back. \n\n\"You are the most stubborn student I've ever come across!\"\n\n\"Place me as you would anyone else, but Slytherin will spin in his grave if you put me in his house.\"\n\nDumbledore seems exceedingly amused watching me go back and forth with the hat.  Though he can't hear our dialogue, he's sure something exceedingly complex is being discussed.  Thirty seven minutes after the hat was put upon my head it speaks to Dumbledore.  \"She will excel in ways beyond expectation in Slytherin, but insists she won't belong there.\"\n\nDumbledore laughs the deepest, longest belly laugh I've ever heard.  He sheds tears at the exasperation of the hat.  Finally, when he composes himself, he responds.  \"Why not give Slytherin house a try?  Try it for a week or two, and if it doesn't work out, we will move you.  You can be friends with whomever you choose, you know.  And personally, I think you would liven the dungeons up in ways never before imagined.\"\n\n\"Alright, I'll take that offer.  There you go, hat, you win,\" I giggle. \n\n\"One final thing,\" Dumbledore says with a smile.  \"What is your name? Or rather, what do you want it to be here?\"\n\n\"Kaia,\" I answer. \"Kaia Walker.\"  \n\n\n\nIf you read all of that: Congratulations!\n\nIf you enjoyed it: message me! Nerdygirlxxl on kil.\n\nIf you want to post an equally long backstory: send it as a message to me on here AND hit me on kik to let me know. \n\nYou can play canon or non-canon characters.  Personally, I see my character rejecting Malfoy and running off with the Weasley twins to cause mischief or becoming Neville's BFF and tutoring him.",

            "selftext": "I'm looking for a male character to pair with my own male character, that involves a paranormal theme. I'm female myself, and your real life gender doesn't really matter too much. I do find it easier to RP with other females most of the time, but that's not a rule.  \n\n\nBefore I get into the plot, I'll go into the boring stuff:  \n\n\n\\-18+, 21+ is even more preferred.\n\n\\- Discord only. I don't RP anywhere else these days.\n\n\\- Third person only\n\n\\- Quality over quantity. I don't want one liners, but I don't want every post to be a book, either. \n\n\\- Relatively active, and looking for someone who is also active. One post a day is the bare minimum. Things happen in real life, and that's totally fine, just let me know, please. Someone who can make a few posts a day is even better, but that's not totally necessary.\n\n\\- NSFW. This is **NOT** necessary to be in the RP, we can fade to black, ect. But it's not unwelcome. Regardless, smut will never be the focus...That should be a given by now.\n\n\\-OOC chat. I like to talk to my RP partner, weather it's related to the RP or not, so someone who also does that is welcome.\n\nI think that about covers it, so onto the RP its self:  \n\n\nI'm totally willing to collaborate and exchange ideas for this, as most of it isn't super set in stone.   \n\n\nMy character is going to be a full fledged medium. ie; can see, talk to, and interact with spirits and such.   \n\n\nYour character is totally up to you. Weather they're  a medium as well, a 'ghost hunter' or other kind of paranormal investigator type deal, or just someone who is fascinated by the idea. Maybe they're just a regular person who gets caught up in it. It's up to you, really, and I'm not going to be too particular on what you do with your character. They are your character, after all.   \nHowever, for the sake of my characters' preferences, it would be better if your character isn't the androgynous type. My character prefers the more manly type. Doesn't have to be some big burly guy, but you get my drift, hopefully.\n\nI want this to be a slice of life/romance of sorts, but obviously, given the nature of my character, things that are normal for him, aren't exactly quotidian for the average person. I have more details about my character, but won't go into all of that here. He's an older character of mine, who I've revived, redesigned, and have been wanting to use again recently.  \n\n\nSo, if you're looking for a semi-spooky, strange, and even kooky fun type of slice of life RP, and made it this far, you came to the right place.  \nDM me with some info about yourself, and we can have a chat.",

            "selftext": "Hello there! This is actually my first post on Reddit, although I have known about the site for a while. Anyhow, let's get down to business.\n\nI'm looking for some a fun and interesting MxM roleplay. I guess I may as well lay down some basic information.\n\n***A little about myself***\n\n* I am from the PST timezone\n* I'm pretty active when it comes to posting and will try to do so multiple times a day\n* I absolutely love fantasy. Be it the possible settings, the magic, or just the numerous different creatures that one can play as, I just can't help myself. I'm more than happy to do modern fantasy or even different time periods\n* I really only do MxM ships, so really sorry for those looking for FxM or FxF. This also applies to characters that identify as males since that's a whole separate situation and one that I am not personally willing to get into.\n* I am literate. When replying, my posts can vary in length from anything like one to two paragraphs, upwards of two entire posts on Discord. It really just depends how into the RP I am. \n\nAs a sidenote, I'd like to point out that while romance is always a plus in these sorts of roleplays, it is in no way required. I like having relationships between characters built up over time, not just instant having them go at it. It feels a lot more genuine when these relationships are fleshed out and given meaning instead of just two characters forced to like each other.\n\n***Things I expect from a partner***\n\n* I want someone that is also literate\n* I want someone that can write a good and compelling story, not just leaving all aspects of the plot to me\n* I'd like someone who I can volley posts with, someone who's active and has the time to have fun with these characters\n\nWhen it comes down to it, my wants are pretty basic. I just want someone who I can sit down with and have a good time with both of our characters. I have a plethora of characters, all vastly different from one another. From towering centaurs to ferocious werewolves, or even the charming demon I can play just about anything.\n\nHopefully, we can plan something out and get to know each other a bit better. If interested, feel free to leave a comment or shoot me a message, we can discuss things and exchange discord information there.",

            "selftext": "I am an experienced, advanced literate cis female writer looking for a female (NB and non-cis individuals also welcome) long-term writing partner interested in filling the male roles in the narratives we dream up and to help me create worlds and breathe life into characters that we fall irreparably in love with. I want depth and beauty and drama and writing so delicious you could die. I'm not asking for much, just that special magic that can happen rarely when two talented minds meet a blank page and tackle it together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Come wander with me through worlds of our own making.\n\n# \n\nI am going to try and keep this as brief as possible while still offering as much information as I can so you can decide whether or not you think we'd mesh well before shooting me a PM.  &lt;3 **Bolded big stuff so you can skim, though**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# \u2661 7/6/19 -  UPDATED CRAVINGS/IDEA SNIPPETS SECTION.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Also please don't comment here, PM me if you want to communicate about anything written below.**\n\n# \u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\n\n# The big compatibility stuff/my preferences:\n\n**\u2661** I have been doing RP/one on one writing in some capacity or another for **\\~19 years**. It's why I can write to what I humbly believe to be at least a **somewhat decent** level. Being able to write every single day for months on end for more years of my life than not has given me invaluable experience in character creation, development, world building, narrative, all of it.\n\n**\u2661** I mention this because I would very much prefer it if you are also on the more **advanced literate** side of literate in your writing. I ask that you are fairly experienced, with a firm grasp of spelling, grammar, and storytelling. I **don't** ask that you be perfect, I am a **better storyteller** than I am at grammar and punctuation and all that, tbh and as a warning. I'm gonna make glaring mistakes because the words were just rushing out too fast and I was blinded by the vision of the scene and the things I was trying to convey, but I do try my best.\n\nAll that to say again, we're both human, perfection isn't being sought here, but just write good, k?\n\n**\u2661** **I prefer female writing partners.** NB and non-cis individuals **of course** also welcome. Basically, as long as you weren't socialized as male, we'll likely get along. And I actually get along great with bi men as well, so you're welcome also. I'm sure that's putting all the str8 cis-dudes reading this right into their feelings, and that's fine, I get it, but this is my preference. I don't care to hear your thoughts on it. The answer is \"No, thank you.\" But best of luck to you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- **TLDR: If you're not a straight dude and you want to write the male roles in our stories, and enjoy those roles, PM me!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\u2661** I do **only** play female main characters, and I understand if that is frustrating to you, but that is also my preference. If you don't enjoy playing the main male roles, **do not PM me**. I'm not about asking anyone to do anything they don't want to do. If you don't want to...please don't.\n\n**\u2661** I type much more **casually** in direct conversation via IM/DM, I **overshare** and brainstorm ideas constantly and will flood your messages if you're away with them.\n\n**\u2661** I am **only** interested in **hetero** pairings for our mains. \n\n**\u2661** From time to time I may be interested in F/F pairings of side characters or side characters with my main, and this is about as close to \"doubling\" as I get. This is not a requirement, however. Just something I am open to if it fits the story and both parties are interested. \n\n**\u2661** I prefer **GDocs/E-mail** for the actual writing and **Discord** for ooc chatter and brainstorming. I will bow to pressure if you ONLY use discord servers and you seem like a good potential partner, but I **don't** love the character limitations on there.\n\n**\u2661** I **\\*really\\*** am not comfortable working with anyone younger than around **\\~22+** Like, I have **zero** interest and it'll be a flat **no** from me. Sorry.\n\n**\u2661** I don't know if this is a given, but I also ask that you **help** me populate the **side-characters** as needed for our world and our stories.\n\n**\u2661** I **do not** match **post length** just for the sake of it. I will always try and give as much as I possibly can in a post, but if we need to advance forward, or the post for whatever reason didn't give me a ton to work with or it's mainly dialogue, my reply will be shorter.\n\n**\u2661** **I do not like pre-made characters**. I expect that **all** characters used in our stories are made expressly for those stories.\n\n**\u2661** I write in **third person past-tense POV only**.\n\n**\u2661** I **only** use actors and models for **character references**, and I consider character references **necessary**.\n\n**\u2661** **Please** include your **NSFW** preferences in your **introductory PM**. **\u2661**\n\n**\u2661** SO yeah, just to make it a bullet point, I prefer **long-term** writing partners. We can certainly do **one-offs** for cravings, and leave and come back to stories and worlds and plots as we please, we are after all in charge, but I prefer to have one or two steady people I can turn to when I want to work on something either creatively for a few months or to satisfy a craving in the moment that may or may not turn into something long-term we work on or come back to, and to be that person for someone else as well.\n\n**\u2661** **Please don't invite me to your group role-plays**. \u2661 Thanks so much for the thought and I am flattered but I am only interested in one on one stuff for now. The most I would consider is maybe occasionally working together with a third party if you wanted to bring one in on discord someday or something like that. That could be fun, but I don't do group stuff.\n\n**\u2661** I **don't** tend to like playing **canon characters**. I will take ideas from characters and build something new around that, something similar, but still mine. I will also do this with settings, worlds, drawing from TV and movies and comics and books, etc. But I will never play a canon character and for me to play opposite one, as in you playing a canon character, would have to be a huge crave or a lot of convincing and pretense and plot that I like. It's rare, but not 100% unprecedented. (I was DYING for a Punisher RP as soon as season one on Netflix came out, for example.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Take a look at what I am interested in actually writing just below, and if you find your interest piqued further and want to delve into any of these worlds with me and create some characters, get right into it and start brainstorming and seeing if we vibe, please send me a PM.

If you think we would mesh well together, inquire about ideas I have in your introductory PM and we can discuss and I can elaborate.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The amount of \u2661's denote level of interest.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661 RDR/The Revenant/Western US in the mid to late 1800s**  \\- The overall gist is pretty simple, just delving into a love story set in the wild west, but I think this could be really fun and amazing if we slapped some good writing on it. We'd be dabbling in some historical fiction, which I love, and using OC's. I mention the specific media examples listed as reference for vibe/setting, though I am certainly not opposed to borrowing themes from any source. I'd be interested in maybe doing something with a band of outlaws a la RDR2, maybe trappers a la The Revenant. We could eventually have some homesteading, and there's a lot of room for action and drama and slice of life elements all mixed in together, and for some more robust side-characters if we choose to develop them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661 Fiona Gallagher/Shameless  (US) -** I would like to create a character who is a lot like Fiona in her situation with being responsible for her siblings and household. I'd ideally pair her with a wealthy older guy, or a Jimmy-Steve sort of guy around her age, but without all the dishonesty and secrets. If you haven't watched this show, my idea is also easily explained as it has nothing to do with the actual show and I just want to borrow the overall premise and make it our own. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\u2661\u2661\u2661 Sci-Fi** \\- I have several ideas for the many directions this could go. Something set in space or another planet will likely  be my main interest. Colonists, scientists, explorers, etc. but of course with a love story at center. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIdeas would of course need to be developed a lot more, but I truly love that kind of collaborative development of plot and characters, so that's fine by me. I prefer to leave things as more of a loose skeleton without fleshing everything as far as plot and narrative out tooooo much, because I like for the characters to kind of help to illuminate the way as we go. **Brainstorming and sharing ideas is great, plotting things to death and down to the very last detail isn't much fun for me though.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# \u2661 No matter what kind of world and characters we work in and with, I want a heavy, character-driven, unforgivably human type of story that will ultimately reward us with a beautiful narrative and characters that feel real and alive. Hopefully a friendship and/or writing partnership. Maybe the start of a whole new world we can dabble and play in at our leisure. That's always my hope.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want beauty and heartache and drama and love and yeah, I want a little magic but not in the fantasy sense of the word. I want the magic of two creative, talented minds working together for a common goal and breathing life with words. I want a nice slow to medium-burn of a love story to start out hopefully many lovely stories we can tell together. There are universes to be made.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have characters already kind of fleshed out a bit in my mind and some ideas for side characters and plot and backstory and such for the craves listed here, depending on what your character is like and what we decide of course on for the tone and plot. I want some elements of slice of life, but forward-driving plot at a decent pace. I write with as much depth, detail, and color as I possibly can but sometimes it will be more casual, sometimes it will be really lengthy, just depending on mood.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**If any of this sounds good to you, please don't hesitate to PM me and we can go from there. Most of the above can be worked out.**\n\n# \u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\n\n# Bonus rambling:\n\n\u2661 Usually having the male main character at least a couple of years older than the character I am playing will end up being my vibe. I like to make female characters that challenge and assert against men who might consciously or unconsciously use age as an excuse to dismiss or otherwise silence or stifle them at the beginning, or if they're not the type sometimes also perhaps to use that juxtaposition of age and character for fun because of some of these societally pre-conceived notions, etc.\n\n\u2661 Taking breaks for burnout is totally fine, I will probably take a couple over the course of say, a year, and that's why I prefer having long-term partners. Ditching though, I don't appreciate and try not to do myself. Just let me know, I get it. We're human beings with lives and mental and physical health needs. Or maybe we just aren't meshing? Don't sweat it, just tell me. I will certainly try and do the same.\n\n\u2661 I can get **very** into world, mood and character building and have in the past collaborated on playlists, character references, setting reference, mood boards, etc. with writing partners to help expand on the world based on the mood, using these things as a way to further get on the same page so we can write in both the same tone and from the closest that I think two minds can probably get when working on one world together from two totally different upbringings, sometimes writing styles, background, history, experience, mood, locations in the world, etc. There are a lot of variables, but I feel like discussing characters and setting and vibes and themes you want to include and songs that make you think of a character or a moment or a feeling related to the story and all of that can level some of those variables and bring two people to the same place creatively. It's magic when it happens, and if you've experienced it you know it, and I guess that's what I am looking for again. A little magic, no big deal. Right?\n\n\u2661 I like to tell stories that can sometimes span generations. Maybe even time and space. But most important, stories about families and characters that feel real and who come to life for us. I like having things that I write with long-term writing partners eventually be woven together in some way or another, so that it's a cohesive world, even if in one story we're dabbling in Science Fiction and then in another maybe historical fiction or slice of life or anything in-between. I love doing stuff like that and being collaborative about world building and borrowing characters and adding generations and ancestors and relatives to families as we go and as the opportunity arises no matter the genre or era we are writing in. I've yet to meet a plot line I can't at least loosely tie together.",

            "selftext": "Is anyone here interested in Mass effect? I find the universe and the characters in these games very compelling and would be very happy to roleplay in this world! Preferably I would like to loosely follow the plot in the games but since we all know how bad the ending was I'd also like to mix and change things into something of our own. I've got a lot of ideas about the Reapers and the ending but would rather discuss these things in private. I don't mind original characters added in nor do I mind giving some side characters more spotlight if there's some minor character you fell in love with, it's all fine by me! I would really like to include all of the crew though but obviously some would have smaller roles than others. I might also be interested in post me3 plot but that would need some careful planning. I do have some ideas in mind for that too!\n\n As far as romance goes, I must admit I'm mostly used to mxm but I can do fxm and fxf as well. Especially if I can write Shepard. Pairings I'm mainly interested in:\n\n\n\nShepard/Garrus\n\nShepard/Thane \n\n\n\nBut I can definitely do others too! Like Tali/Liara, Wrex/anyone (I'd write Wrex) EDI/Joker. Honestly I'm probably open for anything you want, the only thing I ask is that I can write Shepard against Thane or Garrus. I know, I know, it's selfish! \n\n\n\nI am fairly active and on good days I can do multiple replies, sometimes it's just one or two. It depends on my work but I will always let you know! So, if you're over 20 and comfortable with multiple characters please pm me!",

            "selftext": "Hi. I'm Mel. I work basically full time and can have erratic online presence, as I am basically married to my job and I have a child. That said, I like to think I am a worth the wait writer. I consider myself advanced literate (10+ years of writing) , and I write novellas as posts (often within 2-3 Discord posts due to their limit). I won't ask you to do the same, but I do expect at least one paragraph per post. I look past grammar mistakes as I often run into them myself because my fingers can be faster than my brain. As long as it makes sense, I'm alright with it.\n\nI live in EST, but honestly I don't care where you live. We'll figure out times to talk and write together, cause I keep weird hours too. I also really don't want to write with anyone under 21, I'm sorry. It's just a personal preference. I also don't really have limits. I will write just about every facet of nsfw, so there's no worry on that front. I will warn you that I delve into some very, very dark themes that can be viewed as disturbing. However, I will write as either gender and I'm alright with most pairings.\n\nNow, for what I'm into writing!\n\n+ Post-apocalyptic scenarios: Borderlands, Fallout, original stories... I'm here for most of it. Please be detailed on what you'd like from these scenarios, as I don't usually cling to romance for these: mostly war and conflict.\n\n+ Victorian/Edwardian: Preferably of the Steampunk variety. I have a few ideas here and some fandoms, one of the ideas being superbly dark and violent.\n\n+ Bioshock: any of the games is fine, I've played all of it. I love it. Let's do it.\n\n+ High fantasy: I don't think I have anything for this, really. But I'm open to ideas and creating a world.\n\n+ Anime: I have a few that I like. Sailor Moon, Hellsing, Dragon Ball. I could likely be persuaded to try something new.\n\n+ Final Fantasy: I love 7. I play XIV regularly. I'm interested in playing in this universe.\n\n+ Sci-Fi: bring on robots, body mods, you name it. I have a story for this, too.\n\n+ Modern Fantasy: I've been reading this cute series about a girl running a knitting shop that a group of vampires live beneath, and she gets into all sorts of shenanigans. I'd like to write in this scenario, or a slice of life fantasy would be great. (the series is called The Vampire Knitting Club, I highly recommend).\n\nNow, I will only write on Discord. I would like us to get to know each other before we really get into planning to make sure we're compatible. Don't ghost. I've never actually ghosted a person but I've had several who have to me despite going off about it being done to them. It's not hard to say you've lost interest or no longer have the time. My feelings aren't going to be hurt.\n\nAfter all that, if you're still here... Please don't hesitate to send me a a message! Let me know what you're interested in, throw a story at me. I'd love to make a world with you! And put somewhere in there that the beacons have been lit, so I know you've read this and we're on the same page. I look forward to writing with you!",

I'm pretty familiar with comics (I've read quite a bit), but I base most of my characters off of whatever show/movie they're in. I've been roleplaying for about 8 years now, and writing is one of my passions! Now, let's get down to business. :)\n\nSome characters I play (and who I would be looking for to ship them with):\n\nWanda Maximoff (Vision preferably, Steve Rogers, Stephen Strange, Loki Laufeyson, Natasha Romanoff, Carol Danvers, and maybe a couple others. I main her so she\u2019s usually my go to and preferred).\n\nNatasha Romanoff (Steve Rogers and Clint Barton). \n\nI'm a pretty simple woman, but I do have some rules:\n\n1. NO OCs! Please only contact me if you want to play a CANON character and please adhere to how the character acts and speaks. I don't want someone who plays Vision to act like a normal man. He's a robot, he's gonna be a little awkward!\n2. Please have correct grammar, punctuation, etc. and be willing to write more than one or two sentences, depending on what is happening. I'm fine with shorter responses, but only if there is a good amount of detail in it!\n3. I like to do pretty NSFW stuff, so please be a little bit older and mature. If you're not comfortable with that but still want to rp, please just tell me! I'll be fine without NSFW material.\n4. Please keep everything in 3rd person pov. Nothing bothers me more than someone writing in 1st person pov.\n\nIf you want to roleplay with me, please message me and I'll be more than happy to give you my Kik, Discord, Tumblr, email, etc.!\n\nThank you for taking your time out of your day to read this!",

To make this post short and sweet, I'll just make a list of things which should make it easier for people to see what I like.\n\nGenres I like: Medieval, Tribal, Post Apoc, Dark, Gritty, Horror, Low Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Pirates, Wild West, Superheroes, Grim-Dark (pretty much every NSFW tag), Greek, Roman, some Fandoms (Fallout, Elder Scrolls, FNAF, Warframe, Game Of Thrones, Star Wars, and Alien Vs Predator are some which quickly come to mind, admittedly, there is a lot which I like, but these are the main few).\n\nWhat I hope (though am not limited to) to do RP wise however, is play a character in someone's world, basically exploring about and doing stories whenever the character stumbles upon them or happens to fall into one. A GM/DM is who I am primarily looking for as a partner (BUT not required!). And hopefully one who has no limits, like me. And yes, I'm fine with playing female characters too.\n\nIn terms of RP, I have no limits, so any story can go with me or anything can happen in RP and i'm fine with it.\n\nSo if you're interested in a partner with no limits, i'm up for it!\n\nIf you want to ask anything, make sure of anything or anything of the like, feel free to message me or talk with me using the Reddit chat system.\n\nThough please, don't just remove me while we're setting things up or whatever else. If you have the urge, please tell me why so we can work on it or so that I'd at least be aware. :)\n\nThanks for reading!",

            "selftext": "I posted this idea before, but my friends convinced me to post it again, so here it is. I'm basically open to any rp, I mainly RP on discord. My discord is: DoctorDDandy#3939 so feel free to hit me up here or there. I hope this gets more interest then last time, please forgive me sempai uwu....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Meta*:  This idea is based off of one of my favorite enemies of Silent Hill 4:  The Ghosts: I decided to expand and kind of fuse that idea with the  undying rebirth of the fabled phoenix: This is the result:\n\nThis  character is completely unassuming, he is basically a courier, or  traveler that is looking for any reason to make a quick buck. He would  be a very basic character at first glance, and would have a very cynical  personality, preferring to keep his distance from any major events,  unless coaxed into them for reasons soon to be explained...\n\nWhen  this man is alive he posses absolutely no notable traits except for an  extreme sense of professionalism, and very little care of his own  personal well being.... His notable features only activate when he is  dead, specifically when he is killed violently:\n\nUpon  death his body will explode, rather violently, into a viscous, black  slime, with a scent of rotten meat. Out of this black stain a phantom  will form of the man will quickly rise, decayed, rotted, and featuring the  most notable traits of how he was killed, this man will rise from the  rotted goo of his body and begin to stalk and haunt whomever it was that  killed him, using what is most psychologically damaging to first weaken  the spirit of his killer, before violently ripping his killer from the  inside out. However he has a very small control over these hauntings...\n\nThe  most notable cases are those that already know of his powers, and  choose to kill him, in order to conjure his violent and destructive  spirit, in order to defeat enemies, \"for the greater good\" Although in  almost all of these cases, the character in question, will do, all in  his power, to destroy the adversary, and save the world, it always leads  in \"the heros\" demise, as the vengeful spirit, infects, weakens, and  devours, the hero of the tale. However there were a few times where  people have managed to outlast the phantom. The following events will  record what is to be expected of a typical haunting of our character:\n\n1  - 15 minutes after death: The body bursts into a very foul smelling  liquid, and coats a large area around the mans death 15 = 30 minutes: an  ear piercing drone, comparable to the sound of metal scraping metal are  heard by all, and an emancipated version of the characters corpse  arises from the viscous black liquid. 30 - 2.5 hours after death: The  corpse will animate, float, and destroy anything the the victim deems a  threat, or otherwise in need of being destroyed (This is the part most  parties that willingly kill the character benefit from, and can easily  turn the tide of a battle, as this rotted avatar cannot be killed or  destroyed)\n\n3 hours - 48 hours after  host death: The victim will now relentlessly haunt the one whom killed  it, using anything, including psychological warfare, to wear down, and  destroy the one responsible for it's demise, regardless of circumstance.\n\n50  - 78 hours after death - The phantom will begin to target any living  host nearest to it's vicinity for death, manifesting any and all hosts  within a 5 mile radius to manifest hauntings to destroy, break down, and  kill, anything alive in this 5 mile radius.\n\n\\+78  hours - the phantom will rapidly decompose into the same foul smelling  fluid that created it, and the character will arise from this fluid with  all of his clothing, and equipment, fully intact and health.\n\nI  had the idea of this character after replaying a favorite game of mine,  Silent Hill 4, where you are constantly avoiding and battling hauntings  and horrific floating nightmares through the game. I am open to  basically any RP concept you can come up with, and if you would like a  bit of eldrich in your franchise I'd love to bring it to you. This  charecter's story and personality are left vague so that it can fit in  any number of themes, it's really not about the characters life, as it  is about what happens when he dies, whether it happens randomly, or by a  hero, or villain, evoking it, this is a story of the horrors that  befall any who willingly, or unwillingly let this terror into their  lives, and what they do with this new entity. I really hope you can come  up with a story this nihilistic nightmare can fit in, and I hope to RP  with you in the future!",

I've been looking for someone - you, not her and not him, ***you*** - to roleplay with me. I've been roleplaying for quite some time, backed by my time playing TTRPGs like Pathfinder and D&amp;D 5e. \n\nI'm over 21 and I'm fine writing NSFW stuff. But I'd like the romance and the action to come before that. If it comes in an organic way, awesome. \n\nI won't lie to you. I'm not the writer that can write a tonne of paragraphs. I can definitely write like heck, but a few paragraphs are my sweet spot. I can write a lot, but not often. Hope that's okay. \n\nIf you're still interested, you should also know I'm in EST in Canada - a place that, contrary to popular belief, is really, really warm in the summer. Our igloos have melted, but I digress.\n\nWhat story would I like to RP with you?\n___\nThe story I have in mind is an action/romance in a sprawling city I've been developing. Although the world it's based in is akin to high fantasy, D&amp;D worlds, the city in question - Sol City - is one that's a bit different. Things like magitech and underground fighting are there to set it apart. \n\nBasically...think Eberron but in a city and it's not as grand. If you got a D&amp;D character in mind, that's great. I got a couple, too. It'll be D&amp;D-esque, so if you like some light dice rolling, lemme know!\n\nIf that doesn't strike your fancy, I can be down for a story in one of the following fandoms:\n\n* Marvel (MCU or 616)\n* Street Fighter\n* Overwatch \n* Huniepop (You read that right.)\n\n___\nLemme know what you're interested in and DM me your choice. If you have some questions, I'm all ears. This will be on Discord, as it is the easiest platform for me to talk to you. Plus, we can chat during days we feel burnt out. c:\n\nIf you've read *all* of this, tell me something: is a hot dog a sandwich? Later days. - T.T.",

I haven\u2019t really taken on a GM role before in a story, so please bare with me if I\u2019m slow to pick up on certain things.\n\nPlot: Within the Amestris State Military, a unit exists to deal with offences of taboo alchemy. Whether this involves detaining, or disposing of any products of this illegal alchemy, the Anti-Illicit Alchemy Force (AIAF) deals with these affairs in any ways they can. All State Alchemists are welcome to try out as trainees in this elite unit, though many drop out as the aftermath of human transmutation and chimera experiments are not easy sights to look upon. A Lieutenant-Colonel of this division (My character.) has been ordered to reluctantly take on a trainee (Your character.) to teach in order to receive a promotion. The plot will follow the cases the pair are assigned to take care of.\n\nThis plot will take place away from the main plot of the FMA and FMAB series to be its own thing.\n\nYour character\u2019s background, gender, appearance and pretty much every thing about them (Aside from being a trainee for the AIAF division.) is up to you. I\u2019m cool with most stuff, as long as it fits the setting.\n\nI can write at a multi-paragraph level, usually averaging at 3 decent paragraphs (Give or take.) for my response. I prefer to write in the third person, so if you can, fantastic.\n\nI\u2019m a pretty slow writer, so I don\u2019t mind if you take your own sweet time in writing responses. I really prefer to take a very chilled out approach to roleplaying so there\u2019s no stress for anyone involved.\n\nI have left the details here fairly brief, so feel free to ask me any questions about the RP, if you have them. I roleplay on discord, so send me your username if you\u2019d be interested. Thanks.",

            "selftext": "&gt;**Pseudonym:** Mal  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;**Age Requirements:** Must be over the age of 25, at least. If I'm honest: I prefer 30+.  I find it easier to chat OOC with people who are closer to my own age and tend to write darker themed things, even if it's a noblebright thread. I\u2019ve been around since the Yahoo! forum and AOL chat room days, and while I have found some players younger than 25 that are amazing, it\u2019s just my own personal preference.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;**Ways To Play:** I like Discord. I'm willing to discuss Google Docs or even e-mail, but Discord makes it easier to keep track of things. Ditch-friendly. I have been having trouble keeping my muse as of late. Looking for people that aren\u2019t going to flip their lid if I don\u2019t answer immediately.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;**Contact:** PM me here and we can chat before moving anywhere else.  Please include your age as a verification when you ping me. \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;**Character Preferences:** I write male characters, for the most part. I can write female characters, but am much more picky about who I write them with.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;**Roleplay Style:** Third person, paragraph style. I greatly prefer fandom to original content (as in I\u2019ll only add your OC if we have fandom characters in play) and right now can't really play anything I have to think too hard on. I don't fade to black. I enjoy writing what happens between adults. It's not the most important part of a story for me but I'm an adult, and an adult who likes to write about adult things.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;**Genre Preferences:** I like detective mysteries, noir, sci-fi (hard and soft), and fantasy. I've been (like most of Reddit, it seems) on a post-apocalyptic kick for a while now. I'm itching to kill some zombies. \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Ideas/Pairings:**  I've written a lot of fandom characters over the years. Some of the more notable ones are: Bruce Wayne (amalgam DC Universe), Joel Miller (*The Last of Us*), Spock (amalgam *Star Trek),* Sam Winchester (*Supernatural*), John Watson (BBC's *Sherlock*), James 'Logan' Howlett (amalgam Marvel Universe), Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe), Reno (*Final Fantasy VII*), Hannibal Lecter (omnibus and *Hannibal).*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;I also write Selina Kyle, Lois Lane (amalgam DC Universe), Dana Scully (*The X-Files*), Mara Jade, Leia Organa, Padm\u00e9 Amidala (*Star Wars),* Ellie (*The Last of Us*), Elisa Maza (*Gargoyles),* Miss Parker (*The Pretender),* and Elena (*Final Fantasy VII).*   \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;Characters I haven't written but might be willing to try under the right circumstances: Rick Grimes (AMC's *The Walking Dead),* Arthur Morgan (*Red Dead Redemption II*), Dean Winchester (*Supernatural*).  \n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;**Final Notes:** I'm really looking for easy going people who are strong writers (little to no grammatical or syntax errors) and want to write easy going things together. **Life comes first, writing comes second.** Please have a writing sample ready (I've got a few you can choose from) and let me know whatever I need to know about you (preferences, limits) upfront so we can make sure we're a good match.  \n&gt;",

I'm willing to RP Star Wars, sci-fi, black ops, war, and in the superhero genre, whether it's like vigilantism or superpowers, idc. Anything is great really. I have quite a few interesting plots in mind, but most of these plots might require more than 2 roleplayers. \n\nAs for my character, you could compare him to Deadpool a little bit. For the time being, he's known as Blackout. I haven't really settled on a name for him yet lol.\n\nNow I'm currently looking for any male and/or female characters that are badass, witty, or can at least put up a fight (RP-wise). The plots I have in mind really depend on the characters' ability to fight, think creatively, or have any useful skills. I might even be willing to do romance and smut with a female character, but only if the writer is +18.\n\nI guess if you're interested you could just comment down below.",

            "selftext": "Hello! I\u2019m an 18 year old Bio student looking for 18+ roleplay partners! Only because I am uncomfortable playing with minors is all! I\u2019ll list some plots and then tell you about me. \n\nPlots: \n(I do pretty much any genre from Slice of Life to Horror, but I\u2019ll put a few ideas down here in case you don\u2019t have anything specific you want to do!). \n\nSo this first one is a bit of a survival type but with a couple twists. I\u2019ve got the prompt which I can give on request, but the general idea is set in the 1930s and 40s-so the WW2 period. My idea is it\u2019ll start off as humanity is fighting a losing battle against the Axis powers (Germany, Japan and Italy). However, the Axis powers\u2019 state of the art machinery turns against them, and both sides are obliterated. From there we can play out 2+ characters surviving in the aftermath. If we want to shake things up we can add in a Time traveller, but we will see how things go! I\u2019ll probably start off with a soldier just to give you a general idea. \n\nThis idea would be more conventional. So pretty much a college sort of setting, this one would allow you to focus on character development more as there would be less action to tackle. I would probably play a rebellious/bad boy type among additional characters in this idea. I have a prompt for this too! \n\nThis one would take place in a mental facility. One character would most likely be a convicted mass murderer with a manipulative and charismatic nature. Another character could play a reporter visiting regularly or a facility attendant tasked with providing food/care to the prisoner. We could see what happens from there-maybe have the murderer escape! \n\nAbout me: \nI play any pairings if the plot will include romantic elements-from MxF to MxM, I have more experience in a male position but can play female characters just as well! As for NSFW, I can include it but I ask if it can be prevented from being the focus of a roleplay if at all possible. Please let me know your preferences when you message me! I use Discord. Finally, please feel free to give me your ideas if none of these suit you!",

            "selftext": "Hello again. My name is Joshua and I\u2019ve been roleplaying for about two and a half years or so now. An online friend of mine got me into it and now I want to branch out and meet some new people! The previous batch didn\u2019t really go so well long term. Met some cool people though!\n\nAnyways, first off, I only use discord for my platform. I always like to be friends outside the role play as well. Become friends, have some laughs and all that. Not required but it would be nice!\n\nI only do 3rd person. I can\u2019t stress this enough. When I began, My posts typically are about a paragraph or two in length, it varies on the scenario currently happening. So I would prefer someone literate as well, rather than someone that replies a sentence or so without any real contribution to the actual role play. I understand people get burnt out, but there\u2019s always brainstorming. Or taking a break and we can just chit chat. \n\nOkay, now I have a couple of ideas I wanted to try out and see if anybody is interested. The main idea of these ideas are romance, but mixed with other themes too! \n\n1). A post apocalyptic world, kind of like Fallout. My character would wander around the wasteland and our characters meet up. They can either be friends or romantic partners. Surviving together, some of the games mechanics (bug free for the role play of course!), fending off feral ghouls, raiders, and super mutants. It could be neat to try this one out.\n\n2). Witch/human. This idea I\u2019ve had for a while now, where your character would play as a witch that focuses on necromancy, a dark magic. My character somehow stumbles upon the witches lair and instead of being sacrificed, she finds him to be useful with her plans. This can potentially be a romance or simply a boss/follower relationship. \n\n3). Secret agents working a mission while keeping a low profile. This one is a bit vague, but it\u2019ll be something like that where it\u2019s a team of two working for the US government in top secret missions. This one will have beings with superpowers as well. \n\n4). Your ideas of course! I\u2019m always open to new ideas.\n\nThese are just a few ideas that I\u2019ve had lately that I wanted to give a try. They can be modified of course so the both of us can get the full experience. \n\nI look forward to hearing from you. See you soon!\n\n~Joshua",

I love immerse, large worlds and well thought out characters with depth. Hopefully You are someone who enjoys those things as well. Wall of text incoming. \n\nPlot - I have been thinking this modern day society, where werewolves live alongside humans without the humans knowledge. Our characters are either in the same pack / different packs / my character is a packless wolf. You are ideally some form of high position, perhaps an Alpha, and we find out that we are mates. How it goes from there I would love to discuss, I'm open to your ideas as well. \n\nGenre - Slice of life, romance, and since it has werewolves, I'm thinking low fantasy. \n\nWho I am - I'm just a slightly eccentric, fun to be around girl from Sweden. I enjoy gaming and art besides roleplaying, and it would be absolutely lovely to find someone that enjoys those things as well for OOC talk, as i find it important to get along out of character as well. English is not my first language, but I think I'm quite alright at it. I write in 3rd person perspective and usually write 1-2 paragraphs, but I tend to match my partners writing length. \n\nWhat I'm looking for - Someone who writes in 3rd person perspective, and who doesn't reply with just one sentence. Friendly and kind is a must, as writing with hostile and rude people makes me very uneasy.\n\nIf you are interested, shot away a pm to me! Also include your favorite animal in the title! Cheers.",

Growing up I was fascinated (pretty much obsessed lol) by LOTR and other  olden time RPG type stories and I was hoping to re-create something  like that as far as the world goes. NSFW aspects are welcome, but I\u2019m  trying for that not to be the focus. Also, I would like it to be for a  longer RP so storylines can develop, and characters can grow so the  action might not come right away. I\u2019m not a stickler about where you go  with the story and I won\u2019t get all bent out of shape like some people do  when you don\u2019t adhere to their exact style or the direction they want  to go in. Just a chill laid back RP that we both can enjoy and be proud  of.\n\nAs for the writing style I usually  write anywhere between 200-500 words at a time in the 3rd person, but  you can write in whatever style you\u2019d. I\u2019m not going to say I\u2019m the  greatest when it comes to grammar, formatting, or even writing, but I  try my best, so please try too. We don\u2019t have to be too frequent, maybe  once or twice a week or more if you\u2019re really into it. OOC conversations  are very much welcome as we can brainstorm ideas to develop characters  and bounce ideas off each other.\n\nFeel free to Message if you're interested. Cheers!! :)",

I want to be creative and have fun.\n\nBIG EDIT: I could really use a lot more writing to keep me busy right now, so here I am.\u00a0 I have a lot of time on my hands and nothing else to fill it with - at least not in a rewarding way. Translation: My muse is on. Everything else is... weird right now. Anyway...Thanks for reading my ad.\n\nCurrently Craving: Some kind of m//, slice of life, best friend drama and fluff. I have a character in mind for this that needs attention. - This is usually always true. XP! But give me any gay, modern plot and I will at least think about it. Also - werewolves. Something loosely based on WoD, Werewolf the Apocalypse would be great. Maybe something based on the idea of AFK, the Kiwi webseries. I just need things to write. \n\nOkay! I feel like I\u2019m horrible at these things, but here goes\u2026\n\nFor the purpose of the roleplay, you can call me Phina (hi!). I seem to have slowly lost all my roleplay partners \u2013 such is life, I know - but entropy is only natural, right? (No, really\u2026I\u2019ve been really lucky overall recently, but I have lost one or two partners and could really use one or two more roleplays.)\n\nAnyway! I\u2019m sure I\u2019m going to scare people off by saying this, but I love both quality and quantity. I love writing detailed stories with strong character development and relationships. For me, it\u2019s the characters that are most important. I do understand that posts tend to vary in length as the roleplay goes on \u2013 I don\u2019t want filler, but please try for at least two paragraphs every time. I will write you novels (at least four paragraphs, probably more), especially if I am inspired. If that bothers you, we are not a good match. That being said, I am very laid back once I get to know you. If you have a character that I love, I will probably be more accepting of shorter replies (no less than a paragraph) - especially if I know a lot about them already.\n\nI hate that we have to cover this at all, but all the standard rules apply. If you haven\u2019t been roleplaying long enough to know them, it\u2019s very unlikely that we will make a good match. As a big thing, please don't control my character. Even little things can be done badly so easily, taken too far or in the wrong direction. I don't want to lose creative control over my character ever. I know sometimes it can be tempting to do it to move the plot along and there are some small exceptions once two characters/the roleplay are established and flowing well, but in general, please don't. Just don't. It will completely turn me off writing with you. Fast. Talking first, at least, is important. Communication is everything.\n\nJust show me respect and I will do you the same kindness, okay? If you need to drop the roleplay, please tell me. That way, I know and I can move on (or we can create something new together). If you\u2019re going to be away -again- please tell me. Don\u2019t be afraid to tell me if something isn\u2019t working, either. Overall, I think communication is really the key thing here. I want us both to be comfortable with everything about the roleplay, and we shouldn\u2019t roleplay at all if something doesn\u2019t feel right. Other than that, just do your best to create/write a realistic and engaging character and we will be best friends - and being friends with the people you write with is generally the best.\n\nLimits\n\nBlood and Gore: None; realistic blood and gore is totally okay and a natural part of life.\n\nSwearing: None; swearing is a valid and a much needed form of expression.\n\nWe fade to black unless I know you well. Beyond that, the specifics of what I'm willing or not willing to write in the bedroom can be discussed later, once you've become a friend.\n\nTimeline\n\n*I live in the Eastern Standard time zone.\n\n*I\u2019m finished school and I don\u2019t work, so I have a lot of time on my hands, but I do spend a lot of time training for three different sports and LARP/tabletop has become a passion. I can still get pretty busy, trust me.\n\n*I will probably have time to post about once a week. However, as workload and other commitments change, it could be more often \u2013 or less often. I think the main issues now are energy levels and muse. I\u2019m finding myself needing more roleplays than I had during school because I do have both more free time and more energy. I still get busy - I still have days where I can\u2019t reply - but I would like to have more than one active, long-term roleplay at a time.\n\n*I will try my best to keep you updated on those changes. I expect you to try to do the same.\n\n*I would love a reply once a week (more often is great, too!). However, I totally understand those when life eats you whole and you have to painstakingly de-zombie-fy yourself because there is/was just too much life going on at once for you to both handle and stay sane at the same time \u2013 never mind roleplaying! Just try to warn me?\n\nImportant Notes\n\n*This roleplay will be 21 plus (I\u2019m 29 now) and over email. Or...I'm also slowly learning how to make good use of a Discord server. I may do a forum or a Google Docs roleplay if you are lucky, though\u2026or even Skype for the right person and plot.\n\n*Also! I primarily do queer roleplays. I haven\u2019t found a standard mxf roleplay fun in years. However, the full gender spectrum is more than welcome. I guess you could get me to do mxf that way\u2026lol!\u00a0 \n\n*I\u2019m queer and NB myself. (I love they pronouns. &lt;3)\n\nOn to the genres!\n\n*Sci-fi *Modern/futuristic fantasy\n\n*Gifted *Runaways\n\n*School (boarding school, arts school, high school, college)\n\n*Dystopian Society/Post-Apocalyptic Society\n\n*Anything with disabilities included in a positive way\n\n*Some modern, slice of life stuff, where we can make cute, fluffy awkwardness together; think close childhood friends that accidentally get separated by life and are reunited years later and all the feelings that could/would bring up, or a long time unspoken crush that is only brought to light when a mutual friend brings together an unlikely couple\n\n*Modern vampires, werewolves and mages\n\n* I like characters with depth. I want fluff, but I also love it when a character has a backstory chalked full of things that make them them, both good and bad. I love to see how \u00a0 \u00a0 they are feeling, what they are thinking and why. I want to see them change and grow as time goes on and they process the things that have happened to them in life. I would love a roleplay and characters that I can get invested in, one that will make me both laugh and cry. Basically, I want realistic characters that I can relate to.\n\nOdd Pairings Rich x Poor (homeless)\n\nDeaf x Hearing\n\nGifted x Gifted (or non-gifted human; think X-Men style)\n\nGay x Closeted (Childhood) Best friend x (Childhood) Best friend\n\nI\u2019m sure there are more I\u2019m forgetting\u2026but any of these can also be combined together for even more fun! I want to take the time to plot with you.\n\nNote: I don\u2019t really do fandoms, and I definitely don\u2019t play with canon characters.\n\nRandom: The friendship between Matt and Foggy in Netflix Daredevil is really well done and adorable. Too bad I never play cannon characters. &lt;3 That\u2019s the kind of bonding and character development that I live for!\n\nAlso! Something based on Sense8 would be cool. What I\u2019ve seen of it so far is awesome - though I\u2019m not sure how a roleplay could be done or how it would go. Falling Skies is also cool, as are Firefly, Orphan Black, AFK and Guardians of the Galaxy.\n\nOh! A note about my writing style: I tend to like to paint pictures with my writing, especially when inspired. I write detailed, flowy and almost poetic posts a lot. Everything has to fit together. If you like that sort of thing and have a writing style close to that, we\u2019ll be wonderful. That\u2019s a bonus in my mind.\n\nThanks for reading all this. I look forward to hearing from you!",

I'll let you create your own character and we will see where we can take the rp after we discuss and share our characters. I want you to create your own character because It makes is more interesting and unexpected than if I choose your role. I am both okay with you playing both Female and Male character. Also, you should be willing to rp as NPC's as well (so will I)\n\nThe Rp I want to try:\n\u2022 High School Roleplay\n\n\nThanks for reading and I hope you are interested in roleplaying together, please write your fav colour at the title of your message so I'll know you read it all the way through the text and not just spamming.\n\nBye~",

A complex, self-sufficient chain of guild-ruled mega districts. It floats amongst a dense fog, held by magically powered devices lining the city's edges. Since it is made of an agglomeration of different districts connected by large magical bridges, there isn't a direct way in, or out of it. Anyone that comes or leaves must be either summoned, or banished by a mage. The arcane arts play a major role in the life of nearly all of its inhabitants, and while tech in itself was never really let aside.. most innovations combine a certain amount of engineering, and spellcrafting. As a result, Lush is stuck in an era of its own, replacing most of today's convenience with magical means, yet dropping any significant tech past the medieval era in the process \\[...\\]\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you are interested, here's the invite link: [https://discord.gg/hQVRyZd](https://discord.gg/hQVRyZd)",

            "selftext": " The Graves family came out of Charleston some ten years ago.  \nThat was all most people needed to know, but of course anyone who happened to be discussing the family Graves typically included mention of their extensive wealth, as well as their ownership of a number of very nice morgues all across the Southeast. \"Graves Mortuary,\" read their signs, \"Everyone ends up in Graves.\" The older members of the Fairhope community had never been particularly fond of the senior Graves' sense of humor. He had passed away some five or six years prior to the events in this story, though, so, as one can imagine, he cared very little for the opinions of the \"common folk\" as he jokingly referred to his neighbors.  \nThe Mrs. Graves was even less popular with the locals. Cold and as standoffish as they come, they say she was a Yankee come down from New York City to marry the Mr. Graves--her senior by a good fifteen years--for his money. She rarely left the comfort and seclusion of their renovated antebellum mansion, though, so very little else was known about her. She died several years before her husband and was said to have been a great beauty in her youth. Her looks had clearly carried over to their only son, Luther.  \nLuther was his own kind of enigma. Tall and handsome and smart as a whip, he was a fixture of the little town of Fairhope despite the general consensus that he was very much an outsider. His calculated generosity warmed his neighbors to him somewhat, but his tendency toward rages and drunken benders frayed the patience he had been so careful to buy. People were careful to greet him warmly, but rarely spoke to him beyond small talk. At least until it was time for him to send out invitations to one of his famous get-togethers. Luther was known for spending lavishly on the parties he hosted in his parents' old mansion and everybody who was anybody was eager to join in the festivities. For about a week before each event, you'd have thought Luther was the most popular man in the town.  \nOn this occasion, Luther was hosting his fourth annual Graves Halloween Masquerade. The old Barrett mansion was decorated with all manner of autumnal spangles--black chandeliers in every room draped with spider webs and painted leaves, intricate centerpieces made to look like ghosts and witches, carved jack-o-lanterns in every corner. He'd even parked a Graves Mortuary hearse in the front yard with actors posing as a corpse and driver. Not a single stop was left un-pulled.  \nLuther, himself, was busily greeting guests as they entered through the intricately carved front doors. He had spared no expense on his costume--a Roman gladiator, complete with a sword and shield. The get up suited his rugged looks quite well, as many of the women noted in their whispered conversations.  \nMrs. Barnett, an old widow from a few doors down and dressed as a 1920s flapper, greeted Luther warmly as she hobbled up onto his front porch, \"Oh honey, ya outdid yourself this year.\" She beamed up at the man, clearly unaware of his social standing with the other Fairhopers.  \nLuther bowed to her and took her wrinkled hand in his, grinning broadly beneath his helmet, \"Thank you, Missus Barnett. I do try.\" His drawl was a little pronounced, given that he was already a drink or three in.  \nMrs. Barnett nodded to him, \"Is Miss Daisy going to be joining us this evening? Perhaps dressed as a Roman goddess?\"  \nLuther's grin faded ever so slightly at the mention of his \"girlfriend,\" but he recovered quickly, \"Oh she'll be along any minute, ma'am. I have a surprise for her, anyway, so she'd best hurry up.\" He winked at the old woman and pulled a little ring box out of the pouch he wore on his belt.  \nMrs. Barnett nodded approvingly and gave him an encouraging squeeze of the hand before entering his house to join the rest of the party goers.  \nLuther watched her go and let out a sharp exhale. The thought of proposing to Daisy filled him with the smallest amount of dread. But surely it was time? Surely they had reached the point in their relationship when they needed to consider the next steps? He hadn't even thought to ask the question of whether or not he even *liked* the woman, let alone if he could spend the rest of his life with her. The memories of his first marriage were still etched on the inside of his skull and he felt like a new commitment might wash away the sins of the old as well as a baptismal font. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\----------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHello! The above is a prompt I put together for a bit of a modern, Southern Gothic Fantasy. Luther here has a secret he's managed to keep from the rest of his small town, but who knows how long that will last between his tendency toward drunken benders and his on-again-off-again relationship with his emotionally abusive girlfriend, Daisy Dupree. I'll give you a hint, though--he gets a bit grumpy around the full moon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo where do you come in? Easy! You can be a childhood friend of Luther's or maybe someone newly transplanted in the small town of Fairhope; a cop, a nurse, or maybe even one of Luther's subordinates in the morgue!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few rules before we get too far into this though:\n\n\\- 21+ only\n\n\\- MxF romance only\n\n\\- Advanced Lit/Novella/Multi-para writers only\n\n\\- Google Docs for IC, Discord for OOC\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStill interested? Write a response to my prompt and send it to me over the Reddit PMs! Introduce your character and describe their relationship with Luther and the rest of the town. This will give me a good idea of your style and whether or not we'd be compatible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI look forward to hearing from you\\~",

            "selftext": "The title hero is often overused. People that take on trials for their own personal gain use it, as a way of sweeping their intentions under a thin cover. Others, use it as a title to be revered, and looked up to. Many heroes aren't the genuine article. Most of the time, they are just people, looking to set themselves aside from others.\n\nTrue heroes are often very rare, and very short lived. Well, most of them, at the very least. The primal mages of the Arcanum coast...well, they're a bit of an enigma. You could ask almost anyone in the kingdom about them, and you'd probably get a smattering of theories of what they are. Some will say primal mage is just a title, taken up by the next person in the line, others will say they're immortals, slumbering away until they're needed again. But out of all the theories, one bit of information is constant. The mage of storms was a coward, and abandoned his companions when they needed him the most.\n\nMost people sneer when that title is brought up. Even more so when people have the gall to utter \u201cStorm Raven\u201d, rather than boil it down to a simpler, more insulting title (although that was about as far as anyone could take it). What he did to earn that vilification wasn't exactly known, either. Most just left it with what they knew. Probably because it was the easier of the alternatives to accept.\n\nMost people wouldn't dare digging into his past. It would only be met with nasty looks and various other unsavory things. A few people were crazy enough to try and hunt down what happened, though.\n\nWho knew? Maybe someone would find the elusive \u201cStorm Raven\u201d slumbering, in some unmarked shrine, waiting for his companions to wake him up once more.\n\n)(\n\nAnd with that brief introduction, allow me to start this off with a brief explanation. This is, obviously, a fantasy rp, set in the country of Arcanum, aptly named because of all the magical happenings that fill the land. I'm planning on making this a rather expansive world, with plenty of lore and mysteries sprinkled in (if the above starter wasn't any indication). \n\nWith that, some ground rules. I'm looking for an 18+ partner, that can keep up with posts around 2-5 paragraphs. I am planning on some romance being included, hence the 18+ requirement. Other than that, some action and drama as well, along with three dimensional characters, all that jazz.\n\nI'm awful at these closing notes bits, so honestly, if I've caught your interest, shoot me a PM. Please add some detail in your introduction, I can't stress this enough. We can definitely work something out. Before I leave, though, I'll ask that if you do message me, put the word stormcloud in your message- it helps me know you read the entire prompt.",

I\u2019m seeking a partner that is also, of course, 18+. We can use either Discord, Kik, or anything you prefer! \u2764\ufe0f The best way to keep in touch with me though is through discord. I\u2019ve been role playing for about 12 years now sooo, I\u2019m pretty experienced. I can write several paragraphs if it\u2019s necessary... and sometimes when it\u2019s not... \ud83d\ude05\n\nCurrently, I have worn many of my plot ideas thin, so I\u2019m definitely looking for something new! You can always just shoot me a message if you wanna introduce something you are wanting, I\u2019m really open minded to most plots. I do prefer that we discuss characters and plot before we start though.\n\nI can always re-introduce some of the plots i\u2019ve done in the past if really need be, but I\u2019m hoping for something new that i haven\u2019t tried yet! \n\nI also don\u2019t have a preference in gender or anything, so females, males, all of the above... all welcome! I do have one preference though, and that\u2019s 3rd person when it comes to the writers point of view. I\u2019m just so used to it, you might be able to convince me otherwise but highly unlikely.

            "selftext": "I am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+ \n\nHello, my name is Allen, and i love history! From the ancient river valleys to the most lewd medieval rulers, i love them all. I wanted to roleplay a storyline that i came up with, and it will have a heavy historical influence.\n\nYour character: This story will center on you, a young but highly capable princess. At a time when no one imagined that a woman could rule a state, you seized the reigns if the kingdom magnificently, turning it from a small kingdom into a regional power. In the process though, you have to put down a few rebellions, and this is where my character comes in. I lead a rebel army and wreak havoc in your state as soon as i hear about your fathers death. Expecting an easy win, you defeat me and lock me away, deciding to show me mercy because i showed you a bit of chivalry.\n\nThis is when the plot gets dicey. A neighboring kingdom decides that they want what is yours, and invade the kingdom. You realize that only with my help can you defeat such a large and powerful army and unite your people. We slowly learn to respect each other, and both prove ourselves as capable leaders, maybe even becoming lovers in the process.\n\n\nThe setting: A bit more about the setting, this story will be set in a small kingdom called Galitia, and your people are called the Galitians. The capital of your kingdom is called Valle\u00e9, a rich town with a castle at its center. Its in the eastern part of the kingdom. Across your kingdom runs a river called the Laugus river, and to the west lies a castle called Eagles Nest. Controlling this castle gives you control over the west. Neighboring your kingdom is a powerful empire called the Alemanic confederacy. Your father, the now dead king, paid tribute to his empire in order to keep them from invading. Since this is medieval, know that most of the kingdom wont respect you on account of your gender. The story will start with your fathers death. The Nobles will push the country to the brink of civil war over who gets to succeed him, as he had no son, only you, his illegitimate daughter. You will take power with the help of your advisor. Some of the Nobles and knights will rebel against you, and how you deal with them is up to you.\n\nThe setup: each storyline will be a season/volume and will be roleplayed in a group chat, (just you and me) our dms will be for discussing anything outside the rp. There will also be a group for alternate storylines or character one shots just to make the universe feel bigger. This other group doesn't have to be used.\n\nThere a few plot twists that i wanna save for the actual rp, the time period can be any you would like, (i would prefer medieval Europe or the middle east) and i would be happy to discuss other matters of the rp if you like! I am also not looking for someone who wants to act like they have no idea how to run a kingdom for the sake of drama, I have had partners do that already, and my god was it annoying. If you like certain aspects of this roleplay but not others, please text me anyway, we can definitely compromise! Hope to hear from you soon!\n\nText me if interested! Thank you for taking the time to read this!",

With that I've roleplayed on many different platforms and worlds- email, vent, skype, kik, discord, SWTOR, WoW, Fallout. When responding I tend to match what my partner has done. Unless its settle a scene. Then I tend to be long winded. :) Response time can be right away or a few hours. I am a new mom so my time is spotty but I will respond or let you know it may be a little longer to fire back something. But I always keep an open line of\u00a0communication. I ask you do the same!\n\nAs the title suggests I am looking for a partner to start a long term roleplay adventure inside the world of Final Fantasy XIV. I recently joined the game and wow, I am in love with it! I would love to grow my blind Au Ra girl inside this world. I have a few ideas but I love building with my partner so we both are happy with the direction of the roleplay.\u00a0\n\nAllow me to say that you do not have to play the game. It's a plus if you do of course! But I am looking for discord roleplay mainly.\u00a0\n\nIf this interest you feel free to PM me here!\u00a0\n\nHope to hear from you!

            "selftext": "Okinogawa High School is a newly built school. It was built only fifteen years ago. In that time, though, they have already built up elite status in both athletic accomplishments and academic efficiency. The school overall has a high average for test scores, and both basketball teams, volleyball, kendo, and baseball teams have already won national championship games. The school itself is a typical Japanese Highschool. It is four stories tall, the first floor holding faculty offices, the gym, cafeteria, etc. The second floor holding the first-year classrooms, third holding the second-year classroom, and the fourth being for third-years. The gym and athletic facilities are top-notch and one of the best in the nation. Okinogawa High School is set on the western side of the (fictional) city of Okinogawa. Okinogawa is located on the northern coast of the Chubu region of Japan, and is generously located near the beach and the beautiful Okinogawa Forest. The city of Okinogawa, while no where close to being the size of Tokyo, is still packed with plenty of things to do. It is also a really safe place to live with low crime-rates, something that the mayor is very proud to boast. Okinogawa was also a major part in world war two, with the military setting up a base that has now been converted into a museum dedicated as a memorial to those who fought in the war. The weather in Okinogawa is sunny only really during the summer and spring. In the fall, there is a lot of rainfall, and the area gets loads of snow every winter, sometimes even blizzards.\n\nHello!

            "selftext": "So, I am currently wanting an old genre/au of mine. The Hunger Games! When I was younger, I always started writings but never finished them, especially this genre. Now that I'm older, it's time to go back to my roots of where it all began, 5th grade year and I really thought I could survive. Anyways, the plot!\n\nThe Capitol has caught word of a possible rebellion/uprising against the tradition of the games ever since the 74th, where they allowed two winners rather than none.\n\nPerson A and B are are given the mission to go into the 75th Hunger Games and uncover the plot, report back to the Capitol, and try to stop it. \n\nHow is the uprising taking place? The plot is being conspired between the victors from the outer lying districts. The quell's main twist is that they are able to volunteer for the games among other things.\n\nI don't care how you identify, therefore the \"A\", but we can work out plot holes if you do not wish to play a female.\n\n\nI am an 18 year old full time college student, and I work about 30-40 hours a week. I am mostly active at night but I try my best respond when I can. \n\nI also like to talk OOC to plan and socialize. It's easier to RP when you have a connection with the other person.\n\nWe can work out the rest of the plot. I RP through Discord only (for organization sake). \n\n1. I request that you're active enough to respond at least once a day. Though, I know that life gets in the way and that's okay. Just communicate if you're going to be taking a longer break, or if you don't want to continue\n\n2. This is not necessarily a romance plot (due to the nature of the scenario) but if you want to, I'm definitely down to work it into the plot!\n\n3. Above point in mind, I ask that anyone who response is 18+ for legal reasons and just my comfortability.\n\n4. I ask that you have good grammar and match my length. Certain scenes don't need much if the characters are talking fluidly back and forth.\n\nSend me a PM with the word \"throwback\" if you're interested and thanks for reading (:",

I'm in my early 30's and would prefer to write with someone nearish to my age, but this isn't entirely set in stone as long as things remain drama free and full of fun writing. I love face claims, IC chatting/memery, etc.\n\nAbove all, I'd love to write an original female character against Robin in some type of alternate Stranger Things verse, but I'm also open to two female oc's. If they're two oc's though, I would love to have them be a part of the actual gang somehow.\n\nAs for slice of life, I'd love to write something involving a slightly forbidden romance such as co-workers, parents of kids who are friends, or women who met at church.\n\nPlease feel free to PM me, and I am also open to hearing your ideas as well!",

            "selftext": " Ello there, hope your day has gone well! 24 F but I play male characters. Your actual gender IRL doesn't matter, but I prefer MxM RP, so I'd like someone who can play as a male character. I don't care about time zones, but I am EST. Yes, I do work but I am able to work on replies during my downtime or on my days off. Also, this will be RP on Discord.\n\nLooking for someone who is:\n\n\\-Semi-lit who can \\*at least\\* type a paragraph (more would be great) and respond at least once every 1-2 days\n\n\\-Is okay with heavy themes, (such are blood)\n\n\\-ERP is optional, but I would love to add it into the story, just not it be the main part of it\n\n\\-Already has a name, age, and picture of their OC(s) ready to present to me\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe can discuss other plots or ideas you have in mind as well, but I have one in mind that I'm interested in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would like to play a character who is in law enforcement, like a detective, and I would like my role play partner to play as a criminal (Or it can be the other way around if you'd wish to be the one in law). If I'm to be a detective, somehow we would meet and become friends. Eventually, I just so happen to be working on a case that you were involved in. We get close, hang out, whatever else and I eventually open up and slip out about a certain crime that has been tricky to him and give vague details that you figure out to be because of you. Romance got in the way of your decision to kill me off, and from there it's up to free-form. You could even be possibly continuing to commit crime behind my back and try to hide the fact or try to turn me in to the dark side of things and become a criminal myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you are interested, please comment or DM me.",

            "selftext": "\"To have blossom on a day like this...\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"The gods write a sick comedy boy...\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey had been breaking for hours. Petals against the empty azure. Dancing low and high. Doomed spirits. Each and every one would come crashing down to dirt and mud. To end. To rot. The cloudless sky carried the two voices far. Across red seas and once-animated forms. Across faded memories. Across what the monks and scholars would call 'Tranquillity'. 'Harmony'. 'Peace'. And of course, death.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"...You think we'll find any?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Any what..? Oh! Perhaps. There ought to be one or two...\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTheir steps were just as audible as the words, albeit aslo subtle. Ghostly. A mockingly creeping danger. The death by a thousand cuts. Only the na\u00efve would call such a thing mere torture. It was nightmare. They did their best to avoid the bodies. The still. Even with total focus such a thing would have been difficult; it had been a big battle. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cR-really? But some might have already got away, right?\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cHmm\u2026 Unlikely. It takes time for a demon to get back on its feet. Especially out away from normal-folk.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t we just burn it anyway? The whole field? That would wake them up! It beats just checking the corpses like this and taking them back\u2026\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cIdiot! And have your life taken instead? Fire cant kill 'em anyway. Besides, this way we get first pick of off the bodies.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cBut the stench alone is- Wait!\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe was right, the stench of the thing was nigh unbearable. But one could argue cooking flesh was little better than sitting flesh, at least for the first few days. The other speaker also recited truths. Dying so recently would mean muscles still had to weave themselves back together. Nerves had to be stitched slowly. He was correct about fire too. It was one of the worst ways to die, if the smoke didn\u2019t take mercy upon you, but even in charred dust, one\u2019s life went on. They were visible now, having shuffled their bored forms into the corner of the eye. One was tall, the other shorter, and junior too by perhaps a decade. The simple garb of peasant infantry. One walked with a spear, using the pole as a staff-walking stick. The other, the young, clutched the hilt of his sword tightly, knuckles white, eyes wide.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFear drowned the little man.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cThat one there. It moved didn\u2019t it? I-its eyes! J-just now. A-and look at the colour! It isn\u2019t pale at al-\u201c\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cQuiet! A-are you sure?\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cOf course im sure!\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe older passed the spear to his companion, eyes locking with mine. He too, shivering. \u201cGods your'e right.. S-So\u2026 we kill it\u2026 again\u2026 and take it back to the capital\u2026\u201d He swallowed low, shaky hands wavering in the spring breeze. Blossom stroked the tip of his nose and was promptly smacked away instinctively as if it were a fly or mosquito. \u201cWe\u2019re rich men! The bounty\u2026 My family wont have to work again!\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe approached. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother death. How many now?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut this fate\u2026 this future. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTorture without end.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would scream if I could move my mouth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe young man turned to mist, something thin hitting him fast through the side of the head. In one ear, out the other, the skull shattering like glass. It caused the body to flip before landing, the force of the projectile scattering the ruined thing like petals in the wind. The older turned before being caught in the side, rending him as a woodsman fells a tree, splinters of bone erupting from the immediately fatal wound. He collapsed like playing cards. His legs one way, the torso the other. Half Split.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA third voice. Out of view. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cYou too?\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe sound of a blood cleaned off a blade.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cImmortal?\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\---\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am looking for a partner to roleplay with on discord for a (low?) fantasy rp about a character who can not permanently die. Instead, they return from death, their body slowly regenerating. I would ask you to write in past tense for the stark majority of your writing, only including present tense sparingly. I would prefer you to write in third person, but ive had some awesome roleplays with first person writers and wouldnt mind trying out your style!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease understand, the above text is not necessarily what your character is thinking. The 'Third Voice' Is also not necessarily your character. Its just a bit of writing to give you an idea of the atmosphere im aiming for and explain the concept. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy initial idea for a setting was one more similar to feudal japan than conventional medieval fantasy (Hence the blossom), but after thought, this idea could really work in any old fantasy setting, even historical fantasy. I still think a Japanese 'samurai' like atmosphere would be the best, but Ill happily discuss other ideas with you, even if you dont want to actually roleplay but just world build. Your character could also be from any background. This could be the first time they are killed and they discover their immortality, or the 1000th, having become totally disillusioned with life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I take a GM style of roleplaying, taking control of setting and most characters, providing a story which ultimately your character stars in. This allows you to experience the plot, meet new characters and learn about them as your own character does. It means I can continually surprise you with twists and offer fun clues and foreshadowing to ongoing mysteries. I will never speak for your character or describe their action. All that is on you. Its your character. I understand that this style is not for everyone, as there are some who enjoy plotting stories out beforehand, so no hard feelings if you aren\u2019t so keen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRomance is by no means a necessity for this role play, but it is always quite fun. I always think its best to wait and see what happens organically regardless.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI normally write 200-500 a response, one or two responses a day. I don\u2019t expect a partner to match me out of obligation, but I would like at least over 100 words. A lot can be said about even the smallest of actions or sentences.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you have any questions, please ask in the comments below so others might read them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope to hear from you soon.",

            "selftext": "Hello!\n\nI\u2019d like to play as a teenage witch named Mochi Moonsong, and you as her human best friend and varsity baseball star, Lime Goldwood. I have art references and biographies for both which I will share upon chatting. This roleplay will take place in a modern bougie Okinawa fantasy era; the world aesthetic is pastels, beach, and Japanese influenced American culture. Witches, mages, and warlocks live amongst humans. They do not necessarily live together in harmony in some bigoted areas; many humans illegally form underground organizations to hunt the magic. \n\nI\u2019d like to conduct this roleplay in third person, descriptive, and literate paragraph styles. \n\nSo a little background for the scenario I\u2019d like to roleplay: \n\nMochi and Lime have known each other since the age of 5, since their parents had moved into the same beachside neighborhood as well as shared the same building that housed their new two separate family-owned shops. Mochi\u2019s mother is a single parent who runs a sweets shop and Lime\u2019s parents own a bakery, though they rival as all local businesses do. Both teens work afternoon shifts in their parent\u2019s shops, and when there are no customers they often spend time chatting on the patio overlooking the ocean. \n\nNow some darker stuff: There had been a tip off - an anonymous man had been snooping around the Moonsong\u2019s residence to reaffirm their paranoia about the witchcraft that accumulated inside. This paranoid stranger was filled with fear of the unknown, a common attribute that the ignorant masses acquire. Anti witch and mage organizations could be found to contact over dark places on the internet, and that\u2019s exactly how the Unseen were tipped. The Unseen are as their name insinuates, a group of anti magic mercenaries who cleanly wipe out their targets with little to no trace. Authorities have banned anti magic organizations from gathering, but as all evil does, they persist. \n\nI have a starter written that regards a scenario where Mochi and Lime are hunted by the Unseen. Lime is not a direct target, him being human and all, but since he associates with a witch therefore he is to be hunted as well. I\u2019d like there to be a balance of fun action and romantic flirting, but I\u2019d like to keep it low on the nsfw content. \n\n\nI have and primarily use kik, please message me for more info!",

I often don't put too much about myself here because If you're truly interested I often prefer you ask me yourself!\n\nWhat I'm looking for is a partner that is willing, and excited to make our own little coherent universe! Meaning something akin to how Marvel does their movies; All tied in the same universe, characters able to weave between eachother's stories, and even team up much like the Avengers! I would absolutely love to have our own Infinity Saga!\n\nAll of this being said, I don't mind adult themes at all. Though when it comes to romance, I can't write male-on-female too well. So, if you're going to play a male character just keep in mind I wouldn't want a romance arc.\n\nI'm very friendly and approachable, but I dislike writers who can't atleast give me two para's a reply. If you are someone who isn't able to hit that criteria, or isn't sure, then It would be best for you to move on. \u2665 PM me if interested! I'll give you my Discord tag and we can discuss all sorts of lovely stuff.",

Fine, fine. \n\nMy name is - well, just refer to me as Kath. It's not my actual name, but it'll do. I'm a literate roleplayer capable of writing about 1-5 paragraphs at a time(though I usually do more if I'm inspired or doing a starter), and I reply rather quickly. It usually only takes me about fifteen minutes if I'm not busy - though, most people cannot do that. I'd just appreciate if you could be at least a little punctual! \n\nI'm high energy and I love coming up with AUs - and I'm an artist, so I often enjoy making art of our characters! I do it quite often, so expect lots of art if we roleplay.  \n\nI have a specific character I'd like to use - I'll put a few images of her below. She's a villain named 'Bluebird'...basically a human that can morph into a bluebird. She also has a few other abilities such as weighing close to nothing, having nails that can cut through steel, being as nimble as...well, a bluebird, and of course, flying. She has three different forms - the first being the normal human form, the only peculiar thing being having wings. The second form happens every once in a while when turning into a bluebird or when interrupted while changing any forms. It's basically a half-bird half-woman thing with the intelligence of a peanut and the anger of a bull. The third form is, of course, a bluebird.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/1jofr7z\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/GgUU4qD\n\nI'm looking to play against a superhero - canon or not. For canon, I highly prefer someone from the Marvel universe (my favorite, of course, being good 'ol SpiderMan). If you wanna play an original, though, that's fine, too! I just gotta know a bit about them so I can think up a plot.\n\nIf this interests you, send me a PM with a bit about yourself and who'd you like to play! Plus which medium of roleplay you'd like to use. I don't use Discord, sorry!",

My characters\u2019 lives in the mid/late 80s and modern day are pretty fleshed out, but there\u2019s a history gap in the 90s (taking place in NYC) that I\u2019d love to explore.   \n  \n\nI\u2019m most interested in writing my death mage, Hector, who is in that awkward stage between being completely dependent on his mentor, and being able to be out on his own. I also write the other members of his cabal as side characters, and have a few vampires I write as well that Hector associates with.   \n  \n\nHector ghost hunts, listens to darkwave, and is addicted to his newfound internet connection: messy Geocities websites filled with articles in mysterious code, occult secrets exchanged in IRC, online markets to exchange magical goods. An easy way to have an in with his cabal is an exchange of services \u2013 what can your character offer them, and what can they give your character in return?  \n  \n\nHector is gay so any romantic rendezvouses must be M/M (strong preference for vampires), but he can of course find friends/allies of any gender. Hector is trained in death magic so it\u2019s possible that I might write graphic gore \u2013 if you\u2019re not comfortable with horror elements then he might not be the character for you to write against. 18+ partners only, please.   \n  \n\nI have face claims, pinterest boards, soundtracks, etc for all my main characters (I am deeply involved and love my characters; there\u2019s no need to fear me flaking or losing interest). I love chatting about our characters, and am certainly open to making friends as well!   \n  \n\nI write in 3rd person past tense with RP partners, usually 2-5 paragraphs each post depending on the scene. I post solo writing on LiveJournal (my characters\u2019 writing goes back to 2008 on there) but realize it\u2019s an old platform that most don\u2019t use anymore. I\u2019m willing to write in google docs, hangouts, email, discord, what have you.   \n  \n\nThanks for reading! I can send links to writing samples in a PM. Stay spooky, friends \ud83d\udc80",

I also have a like for pretty much most genres so i\u2019m open to doing most ideas that come my way! I\u2019m also open to NSFW themes but only if they don\u2019t take the main focus!! \n\nI currently don\u2019t have any ideas in mind so we would have to either come up with something together or I can take some ideas that you already have in mind ( or contribute to any basic throwaway ideas you may have ) \n\nHope to hear from you soon!",

However, I will also roleplay male and female characters if needed. \n2. You must be 18+, and preferably 20+. I would feel uncomfortable writing with anyone much younger than me.\n3. I am okay with dark or adult themes.\n4. OC and canon characters are okay.\n5. Short posts, single paragraph. Im not picky about literacy level, but no text typing.\n6. Third person pov\n\nFandoms (in order of favorites):\n1. Harry Potter\n2. Percy Jackson and surrounding universe\n3. Supernatural\n4.

            "selftext": "HELLO! I've had a giant itch lately and that itch is making me do some MHA roleplay. This roleplay will be a timeskip roleplay either set several years into the future after Class 1-A have all been pros for years OR a timeskip to just after they graduated from U.A. high.\n\nI'm a massive My Hero Academia fan so I'll be playing a ton of characters! Here are my rules/notes for the RP:\n\n* If you plan on playing a canon character, I require you to be caught up to the manga! If you are playing an OC, this is unnecessary.\n* Due to the nature of the RP, spoilers will be included from time to time!\n* I do NOT mind you playing a character (specifically an OC) with a strong quirk. But you have to be smart about it. Are they making bad use of their strong quirk? Are they MASTERS of their quirk? Give them some drawbacks.\n\nOkay that's all I can think of for that part. Now to what I am looking for in a partner:\n\n* 18+ in age! Dark themes can and will occur in this roleplay. Happens all the time in the anime/manga!\n* Literate.\n* Minimum one paragraph per response. The more the merrier!\n* 2-3 responses per day. Same thing goes here, even more and I'll be a happy roleplayer! I understand life gets in the way so if you can't meet the requirement don't worry! I'll understand.\n* Lately I have been doing a lot of low effort RP's (which isn't necessarily a bad thing, some people enjoy short replies and such) so I'll be scouting out for higher tier roleplayers this time around. This doesn't mean you have to be a literary genius of the new millennia, but I am looking for passion and effort put into posts, even if they are on the shorter side of things. I want someone to suck me into the roleplay!\n\nThat's just about everything! If you're interested please send my a DM and we'll flesh things out from there :\\^)",

My name is Nikolas and I've created this small idea that I would love to play out with a descriptive female on Discord! Here is my idea.\n\nIn the tales of the old, there were prophecy's that told of a person who would tear open the sky. This person would be blessed with magical abilities unlike any other, they would destroy the evil that plauged the lands. This evil is known as the cult of the Kosmos. Their purpose is to prepare the world for the revival of an ancient evil god who would soon take his rule again. \n\nThis is a very very short and non detailed version of the actual story. Basically it's about my character who was transported to this world which holds all sorts of different things then earth. Magic, creature's, different races. I have a strong idea on where to start if anyone is interested, I just want to write a nice, dark, emotional story. So please come prepared to play multiple characters and write dark themes!  This will be done on discord!",

Most abandoned the call of darkness, and returned to normal life. But some few still harbour a lingering hatred towards the shaky peace between the races, even until now.\n\n375 years ago, the rise of the Dark Lord brought the Great War to a halt, after each kingdom was ravaged by his corruption. But after having undergone war for too long, the three kingdoms \u2014 The High Elves, the Xerathians, and the Tristians \u2014 united under a single banner, and fought off this rising evil.\n\nAnd they were successful.\n\nThe Dark Lord was slain, and his remnants were crystallised in enchanted ice, known as Byfrost. For generations, the world was in a state of reform, and peace. But now, a mysterious cult has arisen from the shadows, and it is their goal to find the crystallised remnants of the Dark Lord, and converge their very beings, sacrifice their lives, to bring back the evil darkness.\n\nBut to know the danger, one must know their enemy. And right now, none except for the mysterious \u2018G\u2019 knows what this cult\u2019s name is. It would seem his riddle would confuse almost everyone who reads it.

Also, please be able to write in the third person and write 4+ lines per reply. Finally, I am looking for these to be mostly plot based.

Riley was born and raised in a small town in Virginia, along with her little sister, Grace. When she was 17, the family decided to take a Christmas vacation, but a while after they got on the road, a drunk driver t-boned the car, killing her mother and sister. Unable to deal with the terrible loss, Riley resorted to not speaking. It was her way of bottling up her emotions and not letting others in. Her father became an alcoholic, and was eventually put in jail for abusing her when she was 19. Riley decided to move out of Virginia and up to New York for a fresh start. (Your character will be a male close to my character's age (18+) who lives in the apartment building mine is moving into.)\n2. She had finally done it. Charlie had been working up the courage to go through with this plan for a month now, and had finally worked up the nerve to go through with it. Though it may not have needed much bravery for most, it took a lot for her to convince herself to do it. Charlie had been going to a local coffee shop, one (y/c) went to nearly every day. Today, when (y/c) had gone to use the bathroom, Charlie rushed over, placed a sticky note on their cup of coffee, then immediately ran outside to her car and drove away. On the sticky note was her phone number and a small heart, but no name. Once she got back to her apartment, she picked up one of her many books and began to read in an attempt to distract herself. \n3. Sam and y/c had childhood friends since third grade, despite being very different. Y/c came from a very rich family. He had an easy life and was generally very comfortable. Sam, on the other hand, was the opposite. Her family was quite poor, and had barely been scraping by since she was born. However, the pair enjoyed each other's company and remained friends until college. They both went to the local college, as most people in the small city did. It was soon into their freshman year that they started to drift apart. Y/c joined a frat and began hanging out with the more popular rich kids, leaving Sam behind. While y/c was out partying, she was struggling to make ends meet, and desperately trying to find a job in order to help pay her tuition and support her aging mother. Y/c always knew Sam had feelings for him, but never acted on them as she was too shy. He never made any attempt either, as he knew his snobby father would never approve of him being with someone of a lower class. One night, y/c and his friends were drinking and partying, when they began making bets. A few of the guys knew that y/c was friends with Sam and like his father, didn't approve, as she was nowhere near their status financially. Y/c had just lost a bet, and was fairly drunk, so his friends decided that his punishment for losing was that he had to invite Sam over and kiss her. Y/c knew she liked him, so it would be easy. \n4. Maggie Fletcher had never grown up in civilization. Ever since she was a baby, she had been stuck on a small island across the sea from England where she was born. Maggie and her parents had been the sole survivors of a ship that had crashed on the island, leaving them stranded and alone. The family was forced to learn how to survive on the island, eating fish and fruit, and boiling water to cleanse it of bacteria. Maggie grew up watching and learning these techniques from her parents, until they were attacked by a black panther, leaving her to survive on her own at the age of 7. She had now grown into a young woman of 19, living and fighting in the wild all by herself. That is, until an English ship landed on the shores of the island.\n5.

It's just the details I want to have. I mean, nobody can describe the expressions, thoughts, feelings, and actions of a character within four NORMAL sentences. \n\nI do most genres, I'm very flexible in general. But college or highschool... Why go to school in spare time? I just don't get it. Even other time periods, if we both want! But school? \n\nI do all pairings and play both female and male roles. Now where we talk about characters! I do put effort into my characters. I try to express a certain something with them. I don't expect my partner to have a Big Smoke kinda level character (if you want to know, I'll tell you why he's so goodly written) ready for use, but at least something logically correct. An iconic example is two personality traits cancelling each other - shy and aggressive for instance. Seriously, what degree of effort does it take to create a decent amount of meaningful words?\n\nNow, where most things are cleared, have a nice day!",

            "selftext": "First off, all characters that I want to roleplay are going to be 18+. I have to make that super clear before I continue.\n\nSo I am looking for a female partner to dive into the world of college sororities and fraternities. So you should have a little bit of background on those topics to roleplay with me but if you don\u2019t just ask! We can do a little crash course.\n\nI want this to be set at a massive American university where the Greek System of Sororities and Fraternities dominates campus. The drama between groups, the process to get into the groups the days-in-days-out functions of the organizations.\n\nWe have so many options from the top sorority full of the prettiest girls on campus to the sorority know for the girls that always are down for fun, to the fraternity full of athletes, the one full of nerds, the frat known for drug-use.\n\nOne role I had in mind\u2026 you play a freshman girl coming onto campus. She\u2019s a legacy in the top sorority meaning that her mom was in that sorority when she went to college. I play the president of the top fraternity on campus. First off, pledges aren\u2019t supposed to date anyone in a greek group.. Second off, my character might he dating the president of your sorority! Imagine the drama as our characters get to know each other!\n\nThat\u2019s just one idea. We can discuss more options. This is clearly going to be long-term. I can chat on here or on Discord. Let me know!\n\nI have years and years of playing experience. I look for longer posts to get us started and then typically do paragraph responses as we get into the play.\n\nThe way I see it, details are what matter most here. Since we can't physically see or touch one another, I need to be able to feel you through your writing - and you'll certainly feel the same from me.\n\nI hope you message me back letting me know you are interested. We need to talk about a few things in this role before we get going. I love using photographs for faceclaims, outfits, settings, etc.\n\nHope to hear from you soon! Xx Daniel",
