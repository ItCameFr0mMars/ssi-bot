            "selftext": "Hello everyone :) I hope this is okay to post this here. I never thought I'd do this but if it's not okay then I can take it down.\n\nA month ago I managed to meet an amazing person and we seemed to get along very well both OOC and IC. We are the same age (she actually turns 24 today and I turn 25 an exact month from now) and live literally a state away and are in the same timezone.\n\nWe were doing two Fallout 4 based RP's (we were doubling she was Maxson for my OC and I was MacCready for hers. We even toyed with the idea of our OC's getting together for a little bit. Tripling if you wanna call it that).\n\nAnyway three days in all contact just stopped. I still have her on Discord but admittedly I'm hesitant on sharing that kind of information for their protection. However it says shes been offline but if I remember they had it marked so they always appeared that way. I'm honestly a bit concerned about them. I've asked if everything is alright but theres no way of knowing if they read them or not. And I'm not sure if they have a reddit but it's a big place so hopefully something happens.\n\nI hope I didnt do anything wrong and if so I'm sorry. :( I'd just like to know what happened is all. Get some closure I guess.",

Presently     I'm seeking  to write assertive female characters with  weaknesses and     secrets, and  I'm seeking anyone who's able to write a  male   counterpart   to such a  person. Preferably someone with similar    confidence and   assertiveness. I  do enjoy romance and NSFW elements in    my stories, so please be prepared  to do that. But this isn't the    only thing I'd enjoy   having in our  stories. We could dabble with    darker elements, angst,   crime, action,  whatever.\n\nThird   person past tense, please. I'm a very experienced writer that enjoys    writing   poetry and  prose, so I can ensure I deliver no run-on    sentences,   appropriate  character development, proficient use of    English. In terms   of length,  quality over quantity, always.\n\nI'm in the GMT+1 timezone, but I'm not overly fussy about what time zone you're in.\n\nPlease   be happy to use FCs. These play a massive role in my enthusiasm for a   story. I'll make specific requests, if that's alright, and try to   satisfy your interests also.\n\nPlease drop a line if interested. I'll happily share my Discord with you.\n\nCarpe Diem\\~",

A land forcefully taken over by a former military general has left the kingdom and it's towns in a state of disarray. Corruption and crime riddle the land both on the surface and beneath it. Even where it seems peaceful, deep within the roots of every nation corruption runs deep. Set in this world, its' to your character to pick what they wish to do. A land full of opportunity, whether to take advantage of the many in need, or to provide them with the help so desperately seek.\n\n\u00a0\n\n## What is Antium?\n\nSo, let's break down to what Antium itself really is! Antium is a place for those who are looking for a controlled roleplay with an enjoyable story, player connection, and adventure across the large area that is The Antium Empire. Now, of course, there are restrictions that keep the server running well and ensure that characters do not go overboard with their powers and abilities, stray away from edge-lords, and there are a few things that tie into the lore of the server itself. Things like a set list of magical affinities one can obtain, but do not worry these are mere guidelines and magic is not solely limited to this set list and you could just speak to one of our staff about more! \u00a0\n\n## What makes it unique?\n\nSo, what exactly makes us different? What makes our community and roleplay experience something different from other servers? Well, we run off a custom lore and background. This is meant to mean that no other server holds such an environment. Though, in the case of Antium's uniqueness, it entails that no other server will contain the lore we have, the aspects we do, or the set land and its social environment and dangers the way Antium is. This server is set for a more larger-scale roleplay hence due to it's larger map and variety of channels, this means the more the merrier, but this has not broken roleplay down and there are locations to act as hubs for characters to rest back in and converse with one another which will help stray from boredom of being alone in the vast lands!\n\n\u00a0\n\n## What are the 'requirements'?\n\nSo, what are the requirements? We ask that be able to speak English fluently and have a proper understanding of what serious roleplay is! This isn't a place either to go make a PC that can turn into a 76 headed snake that can spit out goblins and giants. There is, of course, a bit of reading to be done when coming into the roleplay in the information provided, but it ensures you know everything you need to! \u00a0\n\n## Tl;Dr\n\nAntium is a new fantasy roleplaying community that provides a unique lore and background for characters to enjoy, along with a friendly community of players within the Discord. While new and small, we hope to build up a playerbase that will allow for the best experience and a large diversity among the characters. The roleplay is set for a more large-scale environment, but roleplay contains hubs as to prevent boredom from character failing to be near one another. It's the perfect place if you're looking for a new active server to get into that holds a unique sense and feel to it! We hope to see some more new faces coming to our community!\n\nDiscord Link: [https://discord.gg/EEbjSyj](https://discord.gg/EEbjSyj)",

As for what I\u2019m looking for, I\u2019m not clear on what I\u2019m looking for plot-wise, but I can tell you this: \n\nI love romance, and it\u2019s a definite must, whether it\u2019s FxF or MxF, and I always play female. I\u2019m into drama, action, dark themes, supernatural, slice of life, horror, adventure, and pretty much all of the above. My imagination has troubles when it comes to fantasy and magic, though. \n\nI\u2019m looking for something original that we create together! \n\nLet me also mention this: I\u2019m not looking for a sex-based roleplay, but enjoy including it into the story as it fits, with an appropriate build. \n\nMy preference for style is 1st person, but I can do 3rd as well. I don\u2019t care about post length, and think a paragraph is just fine. I cannot find 2+ paragraphs fun, as I feel like it hinders the partners\u2019 abilities to move the story along. Although, when starting a new roleplay I can definitely see where length is necessary. It\u2019s just easier to bounce off of replies when they\u2019re shorter, especially with dialogue. \n\nIf you have any prompts, plots, or ideas you\u2019d like to discuss or roleplay, send me a message so we can get to creating something together. I hope you took time to read this, I tried to keep it short, so if you have any further comments/questions, message me! Thanks, Bailey.",

There is a rumor going around the empire that the new emperor is the most beautiful person to have graced the earth's ground. With skin as pale as snow and eyes as big and bright as the moon itself, he was truly magnificent. He walks and talks with such grace and honor, making both men and women swoon at the sight of him. \n\nHis new personal bodyguard had just been hired. Been picked out as the best in all the land he was tasked to follow the beautiful wherever he may walk. The only problem for the bodyguard was, that the rumor about the emperor was true, and he found it hard not to be drawn into his moonlight eyes.",

            "selftext": "In a scenario inspired by the Q series, the ever busy SEES, the adventurous Investigation Team, and the notorious Phantom Thieves are all mysteriously whisked away from their point in time to a mysterious, unknown location. When the three groups unite, they discover there is something the three of them must do in order to return to their place in time, all the while a mysterious entity watches. With each group having their own reasons to get back home as soon as possible, the 27 persona users combine their efforts to work together and get to know each other throughout their stay in this new realm.\n\nThis is a roleplay hosted by a good friend of mine. This project will involve 27 players in one big scenario. There is a Discord link below to a temporary server to see which and what players are interested. You will only need to know the character you wish to play, and will not need to know the lore or plot of the games. This means that we wish that you play your character in the mindset of your character, and take this semi-serious. We want you to have fun, but also follow a basic storyline. Further questions and explanations can be discussed in the temporary Discord server. We will welcome new roleplayers and people who are interested.  \n\nCurrently, there are only three more slots left to fill, so hurry and take your spot! The three we need are: Ken Amada from Persona 3, and Chie Satonaka and Rise Kujikawa from Persona 4. We look forward to meeting you all!\n\nhttps://discord.gg/sZ3YqqB",

Everything in my life seemed to fall apart. My work struggled, my relationships struggled, and most relatable ... my writing, and the friends and partners I had made along the way, ceased to exist in the world(s) that were built from the ground up.\n\nAs time has marched forward, things have gotten better (dramatically) and I would desperately like to get into role-playing again, however, I fear that I am too rusty to be at the same skill level that I once was. If you are willing to take a chance, I would be sincerely grateful! While I might not be perfect or be able to write multi-paragraph / novella style at the moment, I would like to get better and get back to there eventually. At the moment, the more realistic expectation is that I will probably write closer to 2 - 3 paragraphs per response.\n\nA little bit about me ...\n\n* I am 18+ and am a sucker for romance (SFW / NSFW) in my plots.\n* I enjoy the following genres:\n   * Fantasy\n   * Science Fiction\n   * Slice of Life\n   * Fandom (original characters only)\n      * Star Wars\n      * Harry Potter\n* I only use 3rd person.\n* I only use Discord (and sometimes Google Docs) as my writing medium.\n\nUmmmmm ... I'm not sure what else to write ...\n\nI hope to hear from some of you soon! :)",

While they struggle to figure out what has happened to them, and how to get their town back to normal, the teens have to establish some sort of order and form alliances to survive. But that's not the only thing they have to worry about. They still have to figure out how they got here, and why this place looks exactly like home but without the parents..

They took the technology from the hive race, and weaponized it. By the stars, they managed to turn gravity into a weapon, making small holes in space, to tear through any and all hostile ships that'd come close.\n\nEven as the swarm killed more and more of them off, they stubbornly resisted. They learned how to manipulate hyperspace technology, just by tearing what they could out of destroyed swarm ships. Even as their planet burned, they persevered.\n\nEven after countless years of a seemingly endless war, after countless holes in space, they kept fighting. They learned how to manipulate the swarm.\n\nThey learned how to make them kill themselves.\n\nHumanity, in a last ditch effort, built a giant relay, mimicking the distress call of a swarm queen. That call, drove ship after ship to their deaths, until the race had, essentially, killed itself.\n\nBefore this inevitable extinction, however, humanity built one last ship. One last way off their ruined planet. The force of that ship ripping through hyperspace was what ended up cracking their homeworld, leaving it empty, and barren.\n\nOnce word spread about the heroic race, countless civilizations offered them new homes. Moons, asteroid belts, entire planets, for humanity to start anew on.\n\nBut each and every time, they declined. Instead, they asked for ships to ferry their race across the cosmos. They wandered, for years, after years. Of course, anywhere they ended up with a intelligent race, they were welcome.\n\nThey offered technology and goods, in exchange for information. Always information. Maps. Star charts, scans of solar systems. Even rumors.\n\nMost would ask what they searched so desperately for, instead of finding a place to settle. The leaders would simply answer \"what remains of home. Our Ark.\"\n\n)(\n\nHelllllo, everyone! This is my current pride and joy, my blurb that I hope will become a spacefaring epic. But, before I go into that, you should know something about me. I'm a 20 something male, with plenty of writing experience. I enjoy a bit of romance in my stories, but it's not exactly required. Action and mystery are welcome, as well. NSFW themes are just fine with me, in mild doses. As for my writing style, I write in third person, past tense, with about 1-3 paragraphs per response. \n\nWith all of that out of the way, I hope you enjoyed my prompt! Please, by all means, shoot me a message, and we can discuss any questions you have! But please, introduce yourself! I dislike having to find a way to reply to \"hey I was interested in your prompt\" messages. Anywho, I think that's all from me. Hope to see those messages!",

            "selftext": " Hello,\n\nNice to meet you! Please call me Kat or Whiskers. Like the title states, I am a female searching for a 1x1 experience with someone over 18 (must be female), preferably over Discord. I have nearly a decade of roleplaying under my belt, and I enjoy getting to know my partners outside of our roleplays. I feel that I am a creative and helpful partner who always tries to match lengths! I usually go for 2 to 4 paragraphs.\n\nFor this RP, I would love to build a fun fantasy world (dragons, magick, kings, elves!) with my partner and have a plot that involves a witch interacting with an adventurer of sorts. The witch can be any gender and played by either of us, same with the adventurer. We can hash out the details in greater detail once you contact me, but I would love to get our characters into some trouble and include dark fantasy elements to the plot. I would also love to include romance - maybe a slowburn? - between our two characters, and I prefer MxM or FxM. I have little to no limits and love to push my characters in every sense of the word.\n\nIf what I've said sounds appealing to you, please drop me a PM or comment in this thread. Thanks!",

Therefore, I'd like all characters and players to be over 21. \n2. I'd prefer this to take place over Discord but email is alright too. \n3. I'm happy with some NSFW themes, so long as they happen organically. Violence, gore, darker themes, that's all fine with me. \n4. I write in third person past tense. I can write present tense if you'd prefer but it will always be third person and I ask the same of you. Additionally, I don't mind how much you write, as long as you give me something coherent to reply to.\n5. I'd like the two of us to come up with a plot before we begin. Even if it's just a bare-bones idea that we can expand upon as we go, I find that better than going in dark. \n6. Last thing - I live in the UK and I work full time, so bear that in mind regarding response times. If I know I've got an especially busy week coming up, or I'll be away for a few days, I'll let you know.\n\nOnto ideas! If I've specified a pairing, my preferred character is in italics. If neither is italic, I'm happy to play either.\n\n**Arranged Marriage.** This could be modern day, a historical setting of our choosing, we could incorporate fantasy into it too. \n\n**Cops:** cop x *victim*, criminal x *cop,* cop x cop.\n\n**Medieval (could also be med. fant):** royal x common, *royal* x bandit, royal x royal, something Robin Hood/Maid Marian adjacent.\n\n**Superheros:** *superhero* x villian, superhero x *sidekick*, villian x *superhero's sidekick.*\n\n**Supernatural creatures:** *angel* x demon, vampire x creature x *human.*\n\n**Fandoms. Either canon x canon or oc x oc. I don't really fancy canon x oc, sorry.**\n\nThe Adventure Zone Balance. Canon characters I can play: Lup, Taako, Julia, Lucretia.\n\nBuffy the Vampire Slayer. *oc slayer* x oc watcher, *oc slayer* x human, *oc slayer* x vampire. Canon characters I can play: Buffy.\n\nGame of Thrones/ASoIaF. Canons or OC. Canon characters I can play: Sansa, Arya, Brienne, Cersei.\n\nHarry Potter. Something within the Ministry of Magic might be interesting but I'd rather not do something set at Hogwarts. Original characters only for this one, please.\n\nStar Wars. I'm only familiar with the original triology and the new films, but we could do something broadly based around the rebellion, or something on a smaller scale like rival smugglers etc. Canon characters I can play: Leia, Rey.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for the long post! Thank you for reading if you've made it this far. When you message me, please say in your first message what you're interested in. \n\nHope to hear from some of you soon!",

We\u2019re a group of friends looking for creative, inspiring new players to come and join our world, and contribute to the activity of the server as well as its ongoing story!\n\nWe\u2019re a group that welcomes all types of backgrounds for all types of characters, so long as it doesn't infringe with any lore already in the either the Server's established canon, or the canon of the Fallout games themselves. Our server contains just about every location and faction featured in a Fallout game, as well as some entirely new ones! All creativity is very much welcome; we even have a chat where players can contribute lore of their own to the world. We have no limit on word-count, so there\u2019s little pressure to keep up with your fellow members. In fact, there are little restrictions on writing style in general, save that we only ask that you keep your posts in third-person.\n\nFallout: Fault and Blame takes place six years following the Battle of Hoover Dam, with lore created and updated by our members to match the state of the wasteland during that time. We\u2019re always actively seeking new members to contribute to the lore with their ideas, so don't be afraid to let your creativity run wild! We also give players the option to play as either their own **original characters**, or **canon characters/NPCs** from the games themselves. We also allow your own, **personalised factions** to be brought together, via lore-submissions!\n\nCome check us out! We hope to hear from you soon.\n\n\\-[https://discord.gg/bQFfnM2](https://discord.gg/bQFfnM2)",

All known civilizations have been wiped out, No Elves, no Humans... and, worse of all, no Dwarves.\n\nA powerful demon, known as Et\u00e4g Urem with armies filled with goblins, ogres, orcs, and all kinds of evil abominations destroyed the civilized world as we know it.\n\nA single dwarf, Or maybe a human? Maybe even an Elf... or maybe a group of different races deciding to put differences aside? They had escaped the terrible destiny that took the world. This last group of survivors is the beacon of the civilized world. With pickaxes, rum and ale, some seeds, and a little of food, they embark toward the last hope they have: all the way to the north where the forces of evil don't approach; even they are not that stupid... The North has filled with all kinds of dangerous fauna, angels, megabeasts... The dwarves know this, and they had embarked there in search of a new home... A civilization where everyone must work together to thrive and survive. Prepare to defeat the powerful demon! Or die trying...\n\nSo far, the group has settled down in the Borealis Forest, a forest where every single night does have northern lights. And rumors that a settlement is being created as the last resistance against Et\u00e4g Urem. And the few survivors are starting to think this could be their last hope. Death is around this settlement... but, what other hope there is?\n\nAnd remember... LOSING is FUN\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is a Discord server with a simple dice system and a friendly community, I want to focus deeply on Settlement development and internal drama. And use this as experience to improve as Gamemaster, so if you join, don't be scared when you find something unfair and you want me to change it! And... it's kinda NSFW due... certain person.\n\n[https://discord.gg/xmnnWw7](https://discord.gg/xmnnWw7)",

            "selftext": " ***Are you interested?*** Well. I'm glad you are. I'm mostly looking for partners who enjoy a long term story with interesting hooks and concepts. I tend to write around a paragraph average, with some variation to speed up dialogue and add extra detail where it's needed. Please be mindful that sometimes we can get flooded with replies and all I ask is that you remain patient, I do my absolute hardest to reply to everyone. Interesting openers are greatly encouraged and preferred! Best way to get in touch will be through Reddit's messaging system, there we can bring it over to Discord. I do have a KIK on the back-burner.\n\nAs for story, I'll list a few below as a baseline! However, don't think of these as necessary, I am more than happy to discuss alternative settings if you're really itching for something special. If you have any extras you'd like to tack onto these below, awesome! I always welcome twists and turns to keep things fresh.\n\n* **Noir Nights** \\- 1948, Set during the booming american economy just 3 years after the end of the second world war. Organized crime is at an all time high inside cities and black markets are steadily gaining more illegal items to sell. At the height of this madness, a woman is accepted into the police detective sphere and was assigned under a reluctant and quite intolerant police investigator. Before they can settle their issues between each other, a homicide spree launches them into a case against local mobsters.\n* **Ghostly Encounter** \\- A modern house that sits atop very old foundations is plagued by the former building\u2019s ghost. Everything is normal for a few weeks after moving in, until slowly the ghosts activity spirals upwards into either utter chaos or purposeful jabs against the homeowner.\n* **Total Apocalypse** \\- You guessed it, it\u2019s a typical post-apocalypse scenario. Nuclear, Viral, Mysterious; Any way you want. Typically, I enjoy mixing Apocalyptic scenarios with another genre IE: Romance and Apocalypse or Slice of Life and Apocalypse as it tends to yield more interesting and better playable results than just a standard run of the mill story. This is the only one of the options that I'd suggest having some kind of idea you want before contacting me.\n\nOn top of those story prompts, I'll also list a few of my favourite settings from other places such as video games, history, comics etc. As of now I have zero plots and ideas for these 5 below, but you are absolutely welcome to ask and strike up a conversation on them if you so choose. Baring in mind however, set up may take a little more time as we would need to sort out a plot for them!:\n\n**Doctor Who**\n\n**Fallout**\n\n**The Elder Scrolls**\n\n**Cyberpunk**\n\n**Half-Life 2**\n\nAlso, If you're looking at this through search after a few days, weeks or months have passed I'm still around and this profile is a permanent fixture, so there is no time limit! I will edit this again in strikeout if that changes ASAP.\n\nOther than that, I hope to see some of you soon! Have a lovely day, evening or night!",

            "selftext": "Ok, it\u2019s time for a...really weird request for a really weird idea I *just* had. But first, the usual disclaimers:\n\nI am 18+ and while I doubt there will be a *lot* of NSFW in this RP (or even any...you\u2019ll see), I would prefer my partners be over 18 as well, just for comfort\u2019s sake.\n\nI am a highly experienced writer and RPer (25+ years RPing). I don\u2019t need someone that\u2019s been at this as long as I have, and I\u2019m not looking for the next Hemmingway, but I would like someone who can keep up with me. Please only message me if you consider yourself a highly literate partner with an intimate familiarity with the basics of language. Nothing puts me out of an RPing experience like someone who can\u2019t even write in complete sentences.\u00a0\n\nI am female and prefer male partners. *However*, with this RP, I would be willing to entertain a female partner as well. The important thing is for my partner to be highly literate (I say again in reiteration) and familiar with the source material.\n\nRomance is a must. Like I said above, NSFW content would be a bit...odd...in this RP, so it\u2019s not required, but I absolutely want to have our characters develop feelings for each other.\n\nI am looking for someone who is very familiar with the lore of the game Hollow Knight, or is willing to learn. I\u2019m currently on a deep dive in the game\u2019s lore...but that being said, I am far from intimately familiar with it right now (otherwise I wouldn\u2019t be researching it!), but by the time I get any interest in this, I\u2019ll at least have the foundation to start building something. I\u2019d at least like a partner who\u2019s played the game, perhaps knows a bit about the lore, and is willing to learn more and theorycraft for the RP. There will naturally be some gaps...but let\u2019s fill them with well-informed guesses! \n\nOk, so my idea, if you couldn\u2019t guess, is this: our characters are bugs in Hollow Nest before the fall of the kingdom.\n\n...and that\u2019s it!\n\nOk, obviously it\u2019s not *it*. Who are we? What\u2019s our life? What happens to us when things start going sideways? How do we escape Hollow Nest? There\u2019s a lot to be discussed before the start of this RP, so make sure you\u2019re coming at me with a willingness to brainstorm along with that aforementioned familiarity with the game\u2019s lore...or at least a desire to learn more about it. If the RP goes well, I could see to the climax of the first arc leading to our characters needing to escape the kingdom and maybe being \u201ccalled back\u201d like the Knight and Hornet and Quirrel and having to deal with their loss of memories, perhaps even of each other, and have to become reacquainted.\n\nSo that\u2019s it. That\u2019s my weird request! Feel free to message me here if you\u2019re interested and think we\u2019d be a good match.",

The differences aren't that huge, just that Spock and McCoy are bonded through a Vulcan soulmate ritual, and I wrote a backstory for McCoy, pre-2009 film/post TOS.

            "selftext": "\nI stumbled upon this subreddit on my hunt for like minded authors eager to share the creative process of both world and character building. I am currently working and have a life outside of my sordid affair with writing so the time between responses can vary. That being said writing these stories is my main creative outlet for voicing my emotions and thoughts. \n\nMy preferred writing style is third person past tense and I tend to write multiple paragraphs. That being said I do prefer quality over quantity as I would much rather have the visceral detailed thoughts and feelings of a character than meaningless fluff. When it comes to Genres I tend to be flexible as long as the plot grips me and I can clearly see a skeleton for a fantastic story. That being said I shall make a short bullet point list of my more experienced genres.\n\n\u2022Medieval Fantasy (Low and High)\n\u2022Modern Slice of Life\n\u2022Dystopian Future\n\u2022Science Fiction\n\u2022Post Apocalyptic\n\nI enjoy writing stories with darker and more mature depictions of life and it's many pitfalls. I noticed in my reading of various posts that it is customary to specify one's view on possible NSFW scenes. My view is that I can both write those scenes or fade to black for my partners preference. That brings me to my next point I am not here for SMUT stories. I am here to write gripping stories with action, drama, and the occasional slow burning romance. I want to watch and write for characters who change and develop over time in direct reaction to the trials and tribulations they face on their journey towards the destination.\n\nWhen it comes to romance I do have a preference for hetero pairings as I have the most experience in that department. That being said I am more than happy to double up as I love writing multiple characters. \n\nIn regards to fandoms I tend to keep my distance. I love certain worlds and would love to write stories in them but my past experiences have made me wary. I don't like having my narrative freedom restricted by someone else's rules or regulations. I tend to only do fandom if it's an alternate universe and we play OC's with occasional canon cameos or references.\n\nNow comes the part of the Ad where I describe a compatible partner. I have no experience requirement as I am willing to work with both novice and veteran writers. I would ask that you have the passion for story telling and a love for building worlds and characters. I am a talkative person especially about story and character ideas so communication is a must. My parent's taught me that you get what you put in so if I am putting in a hundred percent then I'd like the same courtesy. I would like for them to most importantly be kind.\n\nIf this gripped you or made your creative spark flicker please message me privately. Tell me a little bit about yourself, what in the Ad really grabbed your attention, and what types of stories you enjoy writing. I'll be sure to get back to you as soon as possible.\n\nThanks for taking the time out of your day to read the ramblings of a young aspiring author. I wish all of you the best of luck in your searches for a fantastic partner. \n\nTo my future partner I look forward to reading your message and our journey forward creating brilliant and beautiful stories.",

Stories like Sleeping Beauty, Swan Princess, Snow White etc. I want to make darker, more interesting. Perhaps the Happy ending never does come, and if it does it doesn\u2019t happen for a while. It\u2019s a really interesting idea that can be messed with at a bunch of different angles, even something done during modern or Victorian time.\n\n\nResponses should be a paragraph or more. I tend to get lengthy with my responses which can be really fun if the partner is doing that as well!\n\nI am usually on 24/7 most of the time (PST.) However I only require my partners to at least post once a day, and if something comes up in life? Don\u2019t worry about it, just don\u2019t forget to tell me.\n\nLastly I just want to thank you again for reading! As I said I do like using discord, so send me a reply, and don\u2019t be shy!

I apologize that I just posted recently and am now posting once more. \n\nMy last posts I have been looking for partners for 3rd person, long responses, and all that shabang. Well now I\u2019ve been wanting to role playing with someone that can do a role play where we don\u2019t have to be so serious. \n\nSometimes it can be draining responding with long responses, detailing the scenes and all that. I\u2019m looking for one person where we can do a simple role play in either 1st or 3rd person where the replies are a few sentences or a paragraph long. \n\nA little info about me. I reside in California and in the PST time zone. I enjoy talking to people and work where I\u2019m able to be on my phone often so I can reply multiple times a day. \n\nNow anyways! I have a few ideas on what role plays we can do but I\u2019m always open to ideas. \n\n1). Office romance. One of our characters is a new worker and the other takes a liking to them. Something like this and of course we can discuss more details if we select this one!\n\n2). School place romance. College just began and our characters have the same class. One day for school work one of them has trouble and ask the other character for help and they begin talking more and so on. You know where it goes. Slow build up is always nice. \n\n3). Your idea. I\u2019m always open to ideas as I\u2019m down for anything. Except historical types and fandom ones. \n\nFeel free to contact me for my Discord since I only use discord for role playing. Thank you for reading and I hope to hear from you soon. \n\n~Josh",

But what if magic *isn't* there? What if only  less the one percent of all living beings possessed magic?\n\nThis is the world you find yourself in. Kingdoms are set in eternal conflict, unending struggles between the earth, disease, and deep set in corruption. There are no leaders here: only tyrants. Eair itself is ancient, but the history falls through everyones fingers, for who would have time to record time in such a dangerous backdrop? History is almost all steeped in myth and legend, nothing is set in stone and everything is up to interpretation. \n\nThis is where you find yourself. \n\n-------------\n\nThis a small little introduction that helps you understand what kind of world you'll be put into if you let me have your reigns. It's not 100% roleplay, and will have certain d&amp;d type mechanics. Nothing super involved, and it'll mostly take the form of your HP, and some bwhind the scenes dice roles on my end so thay things aren't entirely up to me.\n\nIf you respond I can give you background on some of the kingdoms and such that you'll be able to start off in, and we'll talk more about your preferences for the roleplay. We can also have me play as a sort of companion, if you'd like. \n\nExpect plenty of combat, exploration, socializing, and even some survival mechanics if you'd like.\n\nWe can roleplay via messages, chat, or Kik.\nHope to talk to you soon!

I don't really care what gender you are, but I prefer to do GirlxBoy and I will only play female characters. I'm sorry, I just don't like playing male characters. I do way better at female characters. \n\nI'd rather you be 18+ and your characters 18+ too, so if anything mature occurs in the roleplay then it's no problem! \n\nI love interesting plots, but always like a sprinkle of romance because it's my favorite subject to write about even if it's a slow burn. I also like some of the cliches being thrown in, drama, star-crossed lover's, bickering lover's, love and hate etc! I don't mind fantasy, super natural elements, real life, slice of life and more. I have some few ideas in my head but willing to tweak them. \n\nI also can do SOME fandoms. Mostly anime and TV shows, and some games. I can name them in private and maybe one of them match up and can make a plot based on that. If anyone knows mystic messenger by chance and want to roleplay as one of those characters for me, that would be so lovely. Yet I know probably no one knows what I'm talking about, whoops. \n\nOh, I'm also 20 and a female, as a side note. I will be as active as I can be, I have a job and sometimes just life gets busy so I won't be on all the time. But I will be as active as possible and tell you when I'm busy. \n\nSorry this is a confusing mess, if you have anymore questions and/ you're interested,my discord is plasticrosepetals#3281",

            "selftext": "I'm sure that most of you taking a look at this prompt *may* not know what either are, or what I could possibly be looking for, so I'll do my best to explain it.\n\nBully was a video game developed by Rockstar Vancouver that took place in a rather awful American Boarding School named Bullworth Academy. As the name suggests you can bully people, but really the game focused around the idea of the protagonist, Jimmy Hopkins, taking over the different \"cliques\" of the school. The Jocks, the Nerds, the Preps etc... It was an amazing game really, with a lot of humor and content that wouldn't exactly belong in today's society as a whole, but it was a lot of *fun.*\n\nTeppu on the other hand is an utterly *fantastic* female MMA manga that chronicles the innate fighting talent and pure sadism of Natsuo Ishido as she trains to become an MMA fighter. Why? Because the wide, beaming smile the cheery and skilled leader of the recently formed MMA club made Natsuo just wanna wipe it off her face. Quite the protagonist wouldn't you say?\n\nWell, what am I doing just infodumping you with stuff that doesn't really matter? I would like to play a sort of crossover AU between Teppu and Bully, with you as the central character. Obviously how much of each we include is totally up to you. We could focus more on the school drama of Bully or focus on the fighting, which doesn't have to be MMA by the way! The Bully games allowed for boxing minigames alongside the regular fist fights. \n\nFor this roleplay I would *really* like for you to play a female protagonist because I think it would be a nice switcheroo. I've always wanted a female protagonist for a Bully sequel and while a sequel will either never come or never live up to expectations, I can at least dream can't I? I don't care what gender you are in real life, just as long as you can play an interesting female protagonist!\n\nEverything else can be discussed in DMs, I hope to at least interest a few of you!",

Said fandoms are (in order of interest from \"I am dying to do it\" to \"it would be fun, with the right ideas backing it\"):\n1. Dragon Age\n2. Harry Potter/Fantastic Beasts Trilogy\n3. Fire Emblem (Conquest or Awakening)\n4. Mass Effect\n5. Fallout 3 (or just an original RP in the Fallout world)\n6. Marvel\n7. DC\n\nOf course, I do need to offer a bit more detail. Here are some of my rules/preferences:\n1. Please be literate. I usually write at least 2 meaty paragraphs, usually more, and I would like a partner who can do the same. Not only that, the better the grammar and detail, the more I want to continue.\n2. Romance is a huge plus for me. For some of them, I prefer to play the \"playable character\" (Hawke in DA, Shepard in ME, etc.), but I am also extremely comfortable with OCs and fully cannon characters. \n3. If you do go with a cannon character, please try to play them accurately. As for Ocs... Like I said, I am completely fine with OCs, but they do have to fit in the world. Don't try to put a medieval character in Mass Effect.\n4. I tend to try to become friends with my RP partners; I hope that is alright.\n5. Please be patient with me, as I am often busy.\n6. I am fine with adult topics, just run it by me first. \n7. I am comfortable with all F (me) xM, MxM, and FxF. Very rarely do I do FxM(me) unless it's for doubling, but exceptions can happen.\n\nI am sure there is far more I could put, but this does really cover the gist. If you are interested, please comment or shoot me a message! :)",

I am an 18+ trans male and am hoping my partner will be 18+ as well. I do have a life outside of rping and do like talking ooc with my partner. I can and will throw memes and headcanons about our characters at you all day. \n\nI am in CST but I have a lot of free time on my hands due to being off of school but once college starts up again, that might change a bit. I've been rping for years, can't give an exact number cause it's been awhile. My requirements might seem picky but it's only because I've been doing this for awhile. I prefer 3rd person past tense when writing. Also, I **do not write smut** it's a preference and I hope my partner will understand that. Outside of that, I'm open to pretty much any other genre or theme. I **double up** and want my partner to do the same. \n\nI prefer **Discord** over any other form of communication. Email and Kik just never work for me and I'm not a fan of using them. I also don't have a limit on how much you should write, I just ask for **no one liners**, I would like something to work with and keep the story rolling. \n\nNow, onto the fandoms! There's quite a few I'm interested in/craving, \\*\\*\\* marks the ones I'm most interested in doing.\n\n* DC (Comics, Animation, TV)\n* Marvel (MCU, Spiderverse) \\*\\*\\*\n* Riverdale\n* Stranger Things\n* Star Trek\n* Detroit: Become Human \\*\\*\\*\n* Uncharted \\*\\*\\*\n* Until Dawn \\*\\*\\*\n* Jurassic Park/World\n\nSome of these I have loose plots or ideas for, and if you have any ideas, I'd love to hear them! \n\nPM if you're interested and I hope to hear from you soon!",

            "selftext": "* for male characters, not necessarily male partners. \n\nI'm going to make this as short and sweet as I can. I'm looking for a roleplay with some basis of romance (go figure). Whether it's set in a fantasy, modern, postapocalyptic setting, I'm all for it. Depending on the setting and nature of the plot I prefer a higher content of action/adventure.\n\nIn terms of romance, I'm a big fan of slow builds. It's important to me that characters face hardships together, that they have moments of intimacy that strengthen their bond, or maybe their love is frowned upon due to their respective homes or species. I want us to root for our duo, to put them through the ringer and watch them rise to the top (or crumble to their knees).\n\nIn modern settings, however, I'm happy to have an ooey gooey romance-heavy roleplay where we have fun doing whatever we want.\n\nI'm hoping that my future partners will be willing to participate in the plot building and be happy to do so. It's tiring pulling all the weight, we've all been there, so let's make this easier on all of us and help each other out.\n\nI'm expecting para-style replies. I don't need a novel, but definitely more than two meaty paragraphs. There is usually more going on in a world than your character breathing and thinking about how the sun is shining particularly bright that day - fill me in on the other details! \n\nI am all for restarting a roleplay or changing a setting if my or my partner isn't feeling the story. There's no pressure at all. \n\nHere's a word bank of themes I typically enioy:\n\naction - creatures - romance - angst - zombies - politics - superpowers - gangs - sports - combat - pets - bonds - forbidden love - magic - species - drama - adventure - suspense - lore - myths - god/dess - class - best friends - platonic - heartbreak - medieval - nuclear fallout - companions - oaths - assassins - pirates - royalty - camps - science - heroes/villains - resurrection - reincarnation - soulmates - weapons - desolate places - monsters",

            "selftext": "**Plot**\nThis roleplay will focus greatly on the contrast between instability due to enviroment/choices and instability due to mental illnesses. One character (I'll call them Gold, for the sake of organization and simplicity) has been a patient at Brunswick Hospital, a long term mental health facility, for about 2 months when the other character (cue Silver) arrives. Gold will be the one more described as unstable due to the world around them; they had a hard life, and that life has left them unstable. All of their life, they have been in and out of mental hospitals, and most doctors that deal with them eventually make the same statement about them. \"You're this way because you chose to be. Because this is all you know, and you find change scary.\"\n\nOn the flipside, is Silver. Silver is extremely unwell due to rather severe mental disorders. They have a loving family, a decent job, and good friends, but it doesn't change the fact that they are horribly unstable. They managed to mask it for most of their life, at least well enough to avoid hospitilization, but when they fully snap, they are legally forced to go to Brunswick. \n\nThis roleplay will focus on their dynamics and how they grow together. Eventually, they will be discharged, of course, and it will then focus on how they manage to stay in contact OR how they drift apart and meet again years later. \n\n**Rules**\n1. I want my partner to be 18+. I'm sorry, but with the mature themes that will be brought up, I am not comfortable working with a minor. \n2. I am fine with FxF, MxM, but it would be a bit tricky to do FxM due to gender seperation. If you have an idea for how to manuveur that, however, I'll definitely listen.\n3. I tend to write a minimum of 2 meaty paragraphs, and I would prefer someone who can do the same. Not only should there be decent length, but please also use proper grammar and spelling.\n4. I try to become friends with my RP partners. I hope that isn't an issue. \n5. As said, romance is perfectly fine, but if you would rather the relationship be platonic, that's fine. \n6. While I would prefer to play Silver, I can play Gold. \n7. I will not put up with improper representation of real disorders. This should be handled maturely and wisely. This isn't just the chance to play a poor victim character that constantly needs attention and reassurance. \n8. Please no Mary Sue's/Gary Lu's. I like fleshed out characters with a lot of heart. \n9. This RP can take place either here or on Discord. \n\n**A Short Farwell**\nI know I probably seem rather stuffy here, but I swear that I'm not. If you decide you would like to try this out, just shoot me a message. Have an amazing day! :)",

            "selftext": "eyo rp peoples. I write exclusively past tense 3rd person. I\u2019ve dabbled in other forms but I don\u2019t enjoy them as much. I tend to match my partner in writing amount but I am comfortable with multi para+. I like verbose rps just as must a 2-4 para ones. My intros tend to go longer. I don\u2019t mind errors as we all make them, but give your posts a skim before sending it. I like e-mail or G-docs or discord for the rp. For chatting with people discord is the only platform. A little bit of PMs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don\u2019t mind any gender pairing, I don\u2019t mind doubling and always tend to play smaller characters as things develop. My female characters are probably a little stronger than my male ones but I don\u2019t have a strong preference to which I play. Any sort of romance is usually a secondary aspect to an rp for me, not the driving force. World, plot, development. I like these things more than trying to make characters love each other. With that said, I do enjoy romance and I\u2019m no limits, let me know how you deal with those scenes ahead of time so I know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor time periods I\u2019ve don't often stray far from Modern, medieval, and varying degrees of future. I enjoy fantasy as much as I enjoy not having it. Slice of life, dystopia, utopia, post apocalyptic. I\u2019m pretty much open to any sort of theme to start building a plot and/or world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am interested in doing some OC work with someone in modern fantasy or Hard Sci-fi. I am open to other things but those are what I am mainly interested in. I have plenty of energy to build up some ideas with someone. I'm eager to get some rp action going.\n\nTo finish off I will say that I\u2019m capable of a response a day, maybe sometimes slower, or faster. But that is my usual turn around. 1 week is the longest I accept for partners. I don\u2019t use RL face claims, or RL people for character photos. Usually I do written description for characters, or use illustrations. I think that is about it. Well at the least it is all that comes to mind. DM any questions.",

The plan would be that this roleplay would start in Phase 1, highlighting how the members of the band learned how to actually live/function together, as well as how their bonds start to form. Of course, there will be time skips and the like, allowing us to focus on all of the phases as time goes on. \n\nThere are, of course, some rules that I think you should see. I don't really feel super comfortable with roleplaying with anyone under the age of 18, especially when anything more mature comes up. Of course, that can't be avoided see the kind of character that Murdoc is. Also, please try to play the character you pick accurately. Otherwise, it really kills the flow. As for how much you should write, I would prefer a minimum of two meaty, detail filled paragraphs. Of course, the roles will be Murdoc, Russel, 2D, and Noodle (who I will be playing). If you are interested in joining, please comment below!\n\nIf you prefer 1x 1 roleplays, I have absolutely no complaints. I most likely will continue to want to play Noodle, and the rules mentioned in the paragraph above still stand. We can work on building a plot privately, so just shoot me a message. :)",

            "selftext": "Hey all! I've been tossing this idea around for awhile. It's sort of fluffy but also moreso a power dynamic/ comradery thing. A zombie apocalypse where the ground zero patient acts moreso like a survivor than a shambler.  They group up with a survivor after a very large fight, perhaps even parting ways for a bit. But interest gets the both of them, after all. For the survivor, the undead is sentient. For the undead, the survivor hadn't outright killed them. \n\nI'm a pretty busy person on weekdays but my weekend schedules are clear. If the above doesn't interest you im pretty heavy into action/power dynamic tropes and my favorite genres are videogame IPs, alongside that I thoroughly enjoy Western, cyberpunk and dystopian. \n\nI'm over 18 and would hope for you to be as well, and please message me what type of stories or ideas you'd love to throw into the pot to see if we'd be a good match or not. \n\nThanks and have a great day!",

            "selftext": "Why hello there fellow fantasy enthusiast! Are you tired of doing fandom roleplays and would love to do a roleplay where the basic groundwork has been laid? Where we bounce ideas off each other and make the best roleplay our beautiful minds can make? Where we defy the CELESTIAL BEING?! Okay, maybe not so much that last part. If the rest interests you, maybe I can get your attention a bit further for you to check out this roleplay I\u2019ve envisioned? I\u2019ll try to keep it short while going over the basic stuff. I have much more detailed information already typed up, if this small dose interests you!\n\n**Basic Information**\n\nThe continent of Jormungand has 4 kingdoms, 3 of which have been in a decade long war. The kingdoms of Ygdamir, Vul\u2019Snar, and Illysiel have been in a gruesome struggle for power. The last kingdom, Tulsvane, has always stayed locked behind its walls and looked down upon the other nations. The nations have no specific race associated with them, but other frequent sole races compared to others. Two other realms exist in the universe, one ruled by celestial beings. The other ruled by demonic beings. These places are mainly thought of as rumors or old folklore by the general populace. They can only be entered through portals summoned by their respective residents. There are people who worship one or the other, but are generally seen as lunatics. These cultists believe it is possible to summon a being from the outer realms, pushing for this to be the answer to win the war.\n\n**Starting plot**\n\nIn the recent months, Ygdamir forces have been pushing Vul\u2019Snar back into their own kingdom. Recently they have been threatening the whole kingdom itself. The king of Vul\u2019Snar has gone missing the past week, as the remaining officials try their best to come up with a plan to help push back Ygdamir forces and save their kingdom. Having their resources and soldiers basically depleted their best plan was to hope the unforgiving terrain could hold them back a little longer until the king appeared again. That was, until the Ygdamir forces began to take shape through the sandstorm. As soon as the troops graced the horizon, the sky darkened and a giant red summoning circle could be seen above the King\u2019s castle. Once it appeared, the whole kingdom basically stood still. The people of the kingdom and the soldiers of Ygdamir all waited with baited breath. What they didn\u2019t know, was it just so happened to be their final breath. A giant  demonic being appeared above the castle, with a scythe bloodied and etched with souls of the lost in one hand. His other hand held the King himself. The being wore just a dark black robe, with a hood that darkened it\u2019s face leaving only his glowing red eyes to be seen. Through the still air, you could hear the king\u2019s cries. \u2018This isn\u2019t what I wanted!\u2019 His voice full of pure terror. \u2018This wasn\u2019t the-\u2018 and with his final words the being crushed his body into a mist of visceral bloody mist.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nHopefully the plot and setting help give you an idea of what to expect in the roleplay. Of course this is just a small sample, if you\u2019re still interested after this bit let\u2019s work on this together. Past this is a few things about my character, your character, and what to be expected from my partner.\n\nMy character is a Half Elf, Half Human royal assassin for the Illysiel crown. Using stealth and lightning speed to help take down opposition. \n\nYour character can be most anything you heart desires. Race /Magic power doesn\u2019t have many restrictions. You don\u2019t even have to be same kingdom as me, it\u2019s up to you! We can discuss this in more detail.\n\n-I can reply multiple times a day, and although it\u2019s not necessary, I would like someone who can reply at least a few times a day. \n\n-OOC is recommended and suggested! I love  getting to know the person outside the roleplay. It\u2019s not fully necessary though.\n\n-I\u2019m laid back and easy going with this stuff, please ask any questions and make any suggestions. I cannot stress this enough!\n\n-NSFW/Romance is alright, but would require build up and make sense.",

            "selftext": "Hello to all that is reading this post! If you are searching for a new roleplay partner, let me give you some tips why I should be the one! I have been roleplaying for about 4-5 years now! I live in the United States and my timezone is EST. \n\n\u2022I would like our characters to be 18 and older, please. I also do not mind roleplaying with males or females. I do not have a problem with Mxf, FXF, and MXF.\n\n\u2022I have a lot of free time on my hand currently since I am off of school for the summer. That means my posts will be literate and description! I will write about 3 and more paragraphs. That is not a problem with me. \n\n\u2022I have no problem with roleplaying in 1st or 3rd perspective. That is not an issue for me. I am experienced in both. So if you a preference, please let me know! \n\n\u2022A few things that I do ask is that if you are not finding the roleplay enjoyable, please tell me. I do ask that you do not ghost. I also would very much appreciate it if you did not roleplay actions of mu character. I will not do the same to you. Thank you for understanding. \n\n\u2022I would love to hear your ideas and try them out. They can be anything and I will be more than happy to hear out what you would like to do! \n\n\u2022I will happily list the genres that I enjoy roleplaying about and I have some ideas brewing for all of them! If you have any questions, please ask them! \n\n\u2022Fantasy\n\n\u2022Video Games\n\n\u2022Romance\n\n\u2022Slice Of Life\n\n\u2022War\n\n\u2022Zombie Apocalypse\n\n\u2022Medieval \n\n\u2022Demons/Angels \n\n\u2022TV Shows",

            "selftext": "The first snowfall of the season was quite a strong one, covering the frozen forest with a layer of white fluff. Sparkling flurries fell faster as the winds picked up. For the most part, the forest was empty... except for a man trudging through the nasty winter storm.\n\nLindo, the soldier sent to start the fight against an unknown evil was caught in the thick of the storm in the forest. His metal armor clashed and clanged with creeks here and there as it began to freeze over. His breathing became sharp as he took his two last steps before falling to his knees, the armor on the verge of being frozen solid from the hours of walking through the snowstorm. \n\n\"Is this why they sent me... to get rid of me? I'll just be another soldier lost in his travels.\" He told himself as he felt the frostbite eat away at his tips, the rest of the body to follow. \n\n\"I cant... I mustn't...\" In a last attempt to find a place for refuge during the storm, he reached back with his weak hands and pulled his sword out. He stabbed it into the ground to pull himself up with the support he had. Even with his optimism, it would take a miracle to save him from the storm, as the suit had begun to freeze over completely and the frost was reaching and creeping onto his skin.\n\n_______________\n\nHey everyone, Chris here!\n\nI was thinking I write up a little prompt based of a Fantasy setting and a snowfall. I then made it a little crazy with my character, the [handsome elven soldier named Lindo](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/41/c2/bf/41c2bf0a43091843967f9e6092fe15ca.png) being close to death. \n\nSomehow someway, a beauty will come and save him. Is it a guardian of the forest that sees Lindo and rushes to help him? Or maybe a fellow adventurer with her own story? Perhaps she has plans to rob or kills Lindo but he is able to change her mind? The choice is yours and we can definately discuss it if you have more ideas.\n\nId love for this RP to be a nice mix between a burning romance and an action adventure story against this unknown evil. The frozen forest is just where we will start and we can definately discuss what this evil is, be it a creeping infection/ corruption of the Land or a Dark Lord Emerging.\n\nI am only looking for partners that are 18+. Please let me know if you are interested in incorporating some NSFW or smut into our RP with the romance. It wouldnt just be for the sake of doing it but it would make sense with the tension building and stuff. \n\nI dont believe there is anything else i really left out of this post but there probably is. If you need anything else from me, just send me a lovely red or orange envalope and i can definately answer it. I hope to have a very fun and interesting RP with you guys! And as always, all my other prompts are open to RPing too so you can just go through my post history! Thanks for reading!\n\n-Chris",

            "selftext": "Hey all,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend and I recently joined a cyberpunk/sci-fi/space western RP forum, and we were hoping to find a few other people to write with! The board itself has a lot of awesome detailed lore, but there\u2019s a whole bunch of creative freedom and we fully plan on making up elaborate plots/quests/worlds/etc and letting our imaginations run wild. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo give a general rundown of what the two of us are currently planning, my character is a super bold and crude android (only this way because of machine learning and picking up traits from her previous owner) that, laughably, runs around wearing 1950s housewife clothing since her model is, well, basically a maid bot (that now has a few hacky upgrades from a combat model that allow her to\u2026 kinda sorta shoot guns and sometimes everyone around her). My friend has a hacker/smuggler dude that has his own ship, and as of now, the two of them are in a partnership of convenience and aimlessly traveling the galaxy. In this RP, androids also have to be wiped every 2 or so years or else they get a bit uhh\u2026 overloaded with conflicting info and start to go a bit psychotic, so we have a few fun things planned with that as well.  We have a few other characters that we plan on porting over to this rp as well, and they include people like a pirate/bandit leader with his own crew of thieves, a morally grey bounty hunter, and a self-proclaimed entertainment overload that has his own floating space fortress full of morally corrupt goodness. And that's not even all of them!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSO, where do you come in?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHonestly, anything goes! Ideally we want to explore a lot of sci-fi/cyberpunk elements like artificial intelligence, body modifications and the implications of tech becoming such an important facet of life, crime and megacorps having control over everything, etc, but we also want to do a lot of world-building and character development, and that involves a lot of fun, silly quests too. Ideally, this means that we\u2019d have some other people on board the ship and having a part in the shenanigans. I\u2019ve always wanted to write out some crazy space opera, but that\u2019s not as fun with just two people. :D\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, if you\u2019re at all interested, feel free to DM me and I can give you a link to the rp forum (sorry, no discord or 1x1!). We haven\u2019t started writing anything yet, but we both would absolutely love to have some more characters to write with. We\u2019re both \u2018literate\u2019 (my responses vary from 400 ish words to 1200, depending on what I\u2019m writing, and they give detailed responses as well), and ultimately, I think both of our writing styles really put character development at the forefront. Not only do I want to build a kickass world with fun stories, but I want to come out with characters that make me feel something, too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso note: neither of us have really written smut and don\u2019t really plan on it unless it\u2019s essential to the storyline/characters. We won\u2019t be writing sex just for the sake of sex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlright, done with my rambling. If there\u2019s any interest, please reach out. :)",

I'm open to any variation of the myth and their love story, even exploring darker themes or modern settings.\n\nA little about me: I'm 26, female, from the States. I've been roleplaying on and off for about 10 years now. I work full time, but I send my replies fairly often, though some days are better than others. Discord is my preferred platform for roleplaying. Adult themes are encouraged, though I don't like making the entire story about that.\n\nFeel free to message me with some of your ideas for where to take the plot and any other things you'd like to incorporate and we can go from there!",

Please, even if you think you cant do it, please, I beg you, message me. There is always that chance it could work out.\n\nFirst and foremost, I would really enjoy a Male partner, however, unfortunately, not a lot of males tend to jump to this kind of roleplay in a heart beat. But I also would enjoy a a female playing a Male. I just want that feeling of classic authenticity. I do ask that you be patient with me and not seek lewd scenes all the time. Usually, I enjoy building up to that moment. That precious moment and that built up lust is released. I love that. Anyway, I do ask for someone with a high vocabulary and someone who is literate. Technically, no less that 6 lines. Someone who is mysterious and confusing at first. I hunger for that moment when my character finally realizes that she is loved by your character after many hard obstacles. Things like arguments, disagreements and snide comments. \n\nMy story takes place in 1950s to 1960s London. The setting would be the old Royal Performance Theater. A place where plays are performed and given a standing ovation. Unfortunately in our story, the director is an older, own sex loving man that is an alcoholic that has no idea what he's writing anymore. However, my character is the cliche, poor London girl  doing whatever it takes to make money to survive. You character is the hero, the man that takes this young girl under his wing so she can move up in ranks in hopes of bringing the same environment back to the theater. Together they work together to give the theater the same appreciation they had gotten years ago. Your character is a famous actor who exceeds expectations when portraying his character. Stubborn, arrogant and very mysterious he is. He is also a playwright that does his own work privately.  \n\nLet's write a story! Message me for my Kik details and we can get started!!!

I\u2019d like this to be long term, slow burn romance and with plenty of drama. Here is a little starter for anyone interested. This is just a prompt, I\u2019d love to make it more unique and specific with my partner!\n\nElementals exist, no longer were they a myth or a legend but a well-known group of individuals who could control a single element whether it be Fire, Water, Earth, Wind, Lightning, Darkness or Light. As the population of elementals increased a school was formed to train and allow these individuals to harness their abilities. Every year new students would arrive and enter a trial to see where they stood, a mock fight between two elementals that would let showcase the new generations power and ingenuity for all to see.\n\n\nThat is where this story will start, or rather on the train ride towards the school. So basically Y/C would meet Duke on the train and they would talk. Duke is an Elemental but is special, unlike most who can only harness one element he has the ability to harness Darkness as well as use Ice instead of water when needed. It would be awesome if your character could harness Light in addition to their main element. They would eventually find out that they are destined to be around one another whether it be as friends or more. Duke and Y/C would end up facing each other in the initial trial fight to see where they are placed and things would unfurl from there. \n\nI am completely open to any changes or suggestions you have, actually I love when my partner chips in and makes it unique with me.\n\nHope to hear from you, thank you for reading this far!",

I'm 30y/o roleplaying veteran, and I've been rping since I was 15 or so- first on Neopets, and then on various internet forums and internet mediums. Maybe you knew me, even. Maybe not.\n\nI've been away from this sort of thing for a while, but now I'm back, and looking to maybe give this whole thing a go again! I usually write in first person past tense (I looked at her, she looked at me, etc) but I can stretch to third person or present tense if I absolutely need to.\n\nI consider myself 'literate', and can write several paragraphs per post or reply or whatever; I prefer to keep things at 3-5 per pop, so events can keep moving swiftly, and we don't get bogged down in unnecessary filler details that do nothing whatsoever to drive the plot along.\n\nI'm willing to give most genres a go, but I prefer slice of life stuff, modern day fantasy, medieval fantasy, Victorian fantasy, science fiction (see a pattern here?), pretty much any kind of fantasy. Low or high doesn't matter, but I prefer things to be in some way not the norm at all, even if it might seem normal for the characters.\n\nSpeaking of, I prefer to play my own gender, but I can play female if it's necessary to the plot. I prefer to focus on two characters, bringing in others when needed, but I'm open to other alternative ideas too.\n\nI prefer the slow-burn romantic kinds of plots, with lots of character development, gratuitous adorableness, and lashings of angst and emotional turmoil. I'm not a huge fan of gore for gore's sake, but if it makes sense in context, I'm all for it.\n\nI have a few ideas floating round, and some more in my head that haven't yet been written anywhere. At the moment, I've got a few everyday ideas, a couple or three involving people with superpowers, a couple of Fantasy things, and some miscellaneous stuff, too.\n\nI'm around most of the time, and can reply pretty regularly, and will often match whatever I'm given in terms of quality, length, etc.\n\nI prefer to use Discord or something similar, but if you're only able - or willing- to use Reddit PMs or emails, then I can work with that too. Please don't send me messages on Reddit chat- I don't use it, and I will totally miss your messages.\n\nI look forward to hearing from whomsoever this might interest!",

I have quite a few plots but I have just about played them to death, so I'm ready for something new. I am interested in fantasy, horror, science fiction, anything like that, but if you have a good slice-of-life plot, I'd be willing to try that, too!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few things you need to know:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I only roleplay in third person and prefer you do, too. First person is really distracting for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-I will ONLY roleplay if you are over 21. I don't always get mature with my roleplaying, but I like the option to do so, and I don't feel comfortable with roleplaying with anyone under 21.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Minimum from me is going to be four paragraphs. I prefer you to be able to do the same.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-I work in a VERY SLOW office. I am around all the time and, because of this, I am extremely active. You will usually get a post out of me 1-2 times an hour, depending on what I am doing at work. I prefer you to be able to at least somewhat be close to my activity level.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-I do not mind roleplaying more mature themes but any romance is SECONDARY to plot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-I typically roleplay mxf. I prefer to play female. I've never done fxf before, but I'd be willing to give it a try!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-I only roleplay over discord. PM me for more info!",

            "selftext": "Hello, there! After having watched Code Geass again, I found myself interested not entirely in the Geass itself, but in the world, it takes place in. I found Britania and the conflict with Japan/the rest of the world to be a great setting for an RP, and more so, the royal Britanian family. I really enjoyed Princess Euphemia and Suzaku's romance arch to be really adorable and interesting too. I was hoping to do something similar to this, but perhaps different? I really wanted to have a character as a royal Britanian Prince, perhaps assigned to Area 11? I'm not entirely sure what to do about the other OC, but there are certainly a lot of choices. Perhaps the character would play is an 11 with the power of Geass or perhaps they too are a soldier with the Britanian army.   \n\n\n \n\nA few things about me:\n\n* I am 22 (I don't RP with people below the age of 18 due to the mature themes).\n* I am in the EST timezone.\n* I am a Police Officer, so sometimes my time gets very limited (not that other jobs don't) since I work about from 5 to 6 to 7 days a week, not including doubles I sometimes pull.\n* I prefer romance to be a part of the story, but if you don't want it to be, that's totally fine, just let me know beforehand. I like to talk in OOC and plot a lot, so please let me know if you don't want to.\n* I like a lot of drama in my RPs since I feel it keeps the story interesting.\n* I would prefer to RP on discord, but if you have an option you would like to try, I am totally fine with that.\n* I'm pretty easy going, so if you have more to add to the plot or the basic narrative I typed above, please don't hesitate to let me know.\n* I try to keep my posts around 1 - 3 paragraphs, but I can definitely post more if it warrants it.\n* I like to post music with my posts sometimes if I feel there is a need for a dramatic feel in a post. If you don't like that, please let me know beforehand.\n* If this at all interests you, please feel free to shoot me a PM and I'll get you my discord ASAP. Thanks for reading!",

            "selftext": "Hey there, once more. My name is Joshua and I\u2019ve been roleplaying for about two and a half years or so now. An online friend of mine got me into it and now I want to branch out and meet some new people! The previous batch didn\u2019t really go so well long term. Met some cool people though! \n\nAnyways, first off, I *only use discord* for my platform. I always like to be friends outside the role play as well. Become friends, have some laughs and all that. Not required but it would be nice!\n\n*I only do 3rd person*. I can\u2019t stress this enough. When I began, My posts typically are about a paragraph or two in length, it varies on the scenario currently happening. So I would prefer someone literate as well, rather than someone that replies a sentence or so without any real contribution to the actual role play. I understand people get burnt out, but there\u2019s always brainstorming. Or taking a break and we can just chit chat. \n\n*I\u2019m looking for someone that is serious*. I\u2019ve noticed some people reply and when we brainstorm, say that work has come up and poof, they\u2019re gone. I know things happen in life, but have some courtesy. Replies shouldn\u2019t be essays long, unless it\u2019s an introduction, intro to a character, and stuff like that. I feel that having super long responses makes the story progress slower. The most fun role plays I\u2019ve ever done was a few sentences to a paragraph or two long per response. \n\nOkay, now I have a couple of ideas I wanted to try out and see if anybody is interested. The main idea of these ideas are romance, but mixed with other themes too! \n\n1). A simple romance. Whether our characters are friends, or same class in school, or coworkers in the same office, they talk to each other and eventually fall for another. This one can include drama, romance, action, adventure, the list goes on. I\u2019m even down to add some supernatural settings to this! It\u2019s heavily customizable. \n\n2). Saving the world. This one has to do more with super powers. This one is more action oriented, but can also include some romance. A battle could be coming up to where our characters would have to help save the world from either an invasion or from other humans. If this interested you we can brainstorm further but that\u2019s all I got for now. \n\n3). The pregnant friend. This one is something new that kind of peaked my interest from another thread I read here a while ago. A friend gets pregnant from boyfriend, but wasn\u2019t to keen on staying so he left. She feels lonely and then begins talking to my character. She doesn\u2019t reveal she\u2019s pregnant at first and begins going out with him. He wonders why she doesn\u2019t order alcoholic drinks but brushed it off. She then drops the bomb a few dates in and awaits his reaction. \n\n4). Your ideas of course! I\u2019m always open to new ideas.\n\nThese are just a few ideas that I\u2019ve had lately that I wanted to give a try. They can be modified of course so the both of us can get the full experience. \n\nAll I\u2019m asking is for serious inquiries please. I know ghosting sucks, so don\u2019t do it. \n\nI look forward to hearing from you. See you soon!\n\n~Joshua",

            "selftext": "Welcome to the worlds of Rampion. https://discord.gg/4Rg6QYp\n\nOctober 3087 AD. Risen Age, 431. The beginning of a new academic semester for Rampion, a university for special talents willing to use their abilities for Mitsuki Industries, and free Concordian space.\n\nAn uncertain status quo holds the powers that be in check. The annual competition of The Games\u2014 something like an olympic contest designed for intergalactic Kazhi combatants\u2014 has gone comfortably well for some time, now. However, new powers and new technologies threaten to upset the peace between galactic nations, and even the politically neutral could be caught in the undertow. The Castellan Hearts raid actively with expansionist intent, while always maintaining a capitalist diplomacy with major powers. The Royals, with a new, somewhat unpopular monarch in power, have an enormous stake\u2014 but their integrity is called into question. A new, ominous threat may engulf the galaxy in darkness, as Kazhis suddenly become prey to ultra-conservative terrorists and enigmatic predators. The Hyphy clan ascertains itself to prevent the exposure of the innocent to wholesale slaughter, but as the status quo drifts from the favor of the Kazhi and peace, will those who cannot protect themselves be forced to look elsewhere\u2014 or perish? With galactic contenders finding themselves armed with greater weapons, booming populaces, and an unimaginable demand for Limen (the lifeblood and source of power for Kazhis), now more than ever is the time for the old to prepare their young and future generations for these uncertain times, and if things continue as they are, for outright war.\n\nWhat will your role be in this story? Time to find out...\n\nAbout our server: Our discord server is a community roleplay, with an elaborate story, dnd-style missions (custom sci-fi stats and rolling included), alien races, and more. There's a lot of freedom to explore in this server, and lot of stuff to do. We're friendly to casual rp-ers and more serious writers alike, with tiered sections putting those with similar roleplaying preferences together (e.g. literate/dark themes vs casual rp/lighthearted themes) while still allowing everyone to interact. We currently boast a server population near 30, with nearly half of our members being active almost every day. In addition to roleplay we offer a friendly community for writing, worldbuilding, making friends, and more. Missions, daily prompts, and memes (so many memes) ensure that you always have something to do in our server.",

            "selftext": "*Station Serenity was founded in the 2400s, following an era of technological breakthroughs with mechanized warfare. Mechas, bipedal assault weapons, became the norm in battlefields and were quickly adopted in sports as well. As can be expected, this technological advancement brought much strife, the mechs beginning to be used by terrorists, political enemies, and criminal cartels around the entire United Front Space. Due to this, the United Front placed strict regulations on who can own a mech, limiting them to military personnel only, nearly killing Mech Sports in the matter of a year. Two major companies, Lockenstif, and Ferenhid, both big-league mech production companies, thought of a brilliant idea: making a haven, free of the United Front's regulation, on the Outer Rims, forming their own Satellite Station and creating their own government. With their mass amount of wealth, this was a rather easy ordeal, and the birth of technological wonder, the birth of Station Serenity, heralded in a new era.*\n\nAstraeus is a Mech Roleplay that features its own, custom-made dice rolling system!

            "selftext": "Howdy! You\u2019ve likely heard this millions of times before but I recently created a new roleplay server set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). \n\n    This server, although not bearing a standard plot created by its owners, instead of more of a sandbox. Server members can create their own unique storylines with each other, and the server in general will have its own larger plot event that everyone can participate in. Server-wide storylines can be plotted as well as individual storylines, requests for roleplay have a designated channel and tips and tricks that may help some with writing will be provided and updated every now and then. \n\n    Not the first time I\u2019ve made a server like this so you e likely heard of this already. I wanted to give yet another shot at it, so if you\u2019re interested, feel free to join and take a look!\n\n   Due to the server being relatively new, not much content has been added yet roleplay-wise but will be added in time to accommodate future members, don\u2019t worry (\u00ac\u203f\u00ac).\n\nhttps://discord.gg/hHRNeea",

            "selftext": "Hi there! I'm new here and to reddit so please be patient if I don't format this correctly. Quickly browsing though tells me there's not too much of a hard and fast format though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm looking for a new female RP partner, hopefully something long-term. I am fairly experienced with 16+ years of RP under my belt, so I am more on the advanced side of literate so you need to be at least solidly literate. I am 31 years old so please be older than around like 24, I just don't care to write with anyone younger than that. I am in the Central timezone and have a lot of availability for the next couple of months. We all have lives of course and I understand that and just ask my RP partner communicate when they can about schedule and post-ETA and thoughts on the story.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat I'm in the mood for:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Slice of life romance. Modern or maybe in a specific decade even. I have tons of pairings and settings we could build off of for this. My favorite slice of life combines the different facets of love and life with a dash of action, a shake of drama, a pinch of conflict. I don't like flat one-dimensional characters or stories. They might start that way, or meek, but character development is super important to me so trust me, they'll always get there.\n\n\\- Willing to combine these facets with sci-fi, a post-apocalyptic setting maybe, cyberpunk (Bladerunner comes to mind) and even add in more action for these genres if we mix them in. I also like peaceful, quiet stuff like farming and homesteading and stuff like A Quiet Place. Similarly it is also fun to disrupt that peace, and fight to reclaim it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe basics about you and me, I guess?\n\n\\- I am only interested in female writing partners who prefer to play male main characters.\n\n\\- I only play female main characters in mxf pairings. I play any gender for side characters as needed.\n\n\\- I roleplay in Google Docs, but I prefer discord for ooc chatter.\n\n\\- I do like for there to be ooc chatter so we can share ideas and get to know eachother a bit.\n\n\\- I write anywhere from 3-10+ paragraphs per post, depending on what the scene or your post calls for.\n\n\\- My style is 3rd person past-tense.\n\n\\- Yes to NSFW stuff as long as it's not the central theme. Love and character development are usually the central themes in my stuff.\n\n\\- No anime, school/university or anything canon. VERY rarely will I do fantasy, and GoT was the only \"medieval-ish\" inspiration I drew from and that got ruined so I'm out on Medieval stuff too. No ty.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you have a sample, I'd love to see it when you PM me! No pressure if you don't.",

            "selftext": "Hello!\n\nSo I had an idea for a historical roleplay. Now it can take place in a few different times and places. But the premise is basically the same. All these people were real. But of course things can be changed for the roleplay.\n\nAs American troops began to ship out to Europe for WW2 their leaders knew they would need something to eliviate their boredom and keep them entertain. And so many were equipped with a radio. Not for military purpose. But to simply entertain to foot soldier. However it didn't take long for the enemy to use this against them. \n\nWW2 \nAxis Sally\n\nBased from Berlin, born in America she would feed lies about the war, the state of America back home and how the fronts were going.\n\nTokyo Rose \nBased out of Tokyo Japan much like her German counterpart she would feed misinformation in order to demoralize the troops. However unlike her German counterpart she would grow dissolisiouned with the Japanese war effort and secretly hoped for an American win.\n\n\nKorean war:\nSally Seoul\n\nBroadcasting from recently occupied Seoul, Sally would lack the musical and material equipment and tracks that the ones before her had. Relying only on her voice to sow mistrust and hopelessness in her enemies. \n\nVietnam War:\nHanoi Hannah \n\nThe one that would become famous. That every Vietnam vet remembers. Her silky soft voice would intimidate and scare many American troops and would also become a source of news for them. More is known about her having learned English at an early age. And while she is fascinated by the West..she truly despises the US involvement in Vietnam.\n\n\n\n\nThese are the most famous different radio hosts that have tried to sow fear in to the hearts of soldiers. And I would like to try a roleplay where I would play just one of those soldiers. Who is later captured and eventually brought to you. Now, who will turn who.. what will happen beyond that I leave up in the air as each story deserves to be different.",

Perhaps you grew up here and got used to the long winters and dark nights. It is a region consisting of 8 major islands, all scattered about but forming one connected society. Pok\u00e9mon that can\u2019t be found in any other region wander the terrain of this place and there is still a lot of research required in order to understand these new creatures.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDespite Sunpo seeming like a perfect location to most outsiders, it is also a region with its own challenges. A corporation known as Team Abyss has been on the rise ever since researchers discovered wild Pok\u00e9mon de-evolving to previous states around the region. It is still unclear what Abyss wants but both the league and official researchers believe that it has something to do with the mythical eight legged horse Pok\u00e9mon that has been spotted only a handful of times in Sunpo.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe look forward to seeing you over at our server!

Sorry!\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0Must be able to reply at least a few times each week. I don't need you to tell me your schedule or when you're going somewhere, but just need you to be able to commit to the movement of the story.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0Must be literate! I don't need every reply to have multiple paragraphs (not that I don't love it) but I do expect correct grammar and at least a few sentences.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0Must be nice! We don't have to be friends, but I am chatty soo...\n\n\ud83d\udcf7If we are going to be doing a Fandom story, please be upfront in telling me how complete your knowledge is of the subject. I like to be sort of detail oriented.\n\n**Guidelines :**\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0Off the bat, I don't play straight guys in romantic situations. The only time I will play a straight guy is if the character is fully needed, or romance isn't involved. Every time I try to play one, they turn into a jerk.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0Playing more than one character is fine. I will also double up if you want me to play a certain character, as long as I think I can play them.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0I love romance. I just do, I'm sappy like that. This being said, I don't like stories where they just automatically are in love. This has a few exceptions, but most likely won't happen unless the story idea is really good.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0I'm also interested in like family style stories, as far as non-romance goes.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0I like to add real life themes into my stories. This is one, because I like drama, and two, because perfect stories in perfect worlds are no fun.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0My only triggers are only triggers when portrayed incorrectly. These are mental health issues, invisible diseases, and suicide. I will call you out on these things and stop the story if they are misrepresented.

How are you going to live your new life?\n\nWe\u2019ve got over a dozen different unique factions to choose from, all with their own structures and roles, including (but not limited to) international police, military, secret agencies, an immortal cult, bounty hunters, smugglers, pirates, freedom fighters, and a bunch of idiots in a spaceship\n\nThe Rift is heavily influenced by Science Fiction, but caters to fans of Historical Fiction as well. We\u2019ve even got our own future events set out for characters from a future timeline.\n\nOur RP doesn\u2019t lock you down in one place, either. If you want to have multiple different RPs going on with the same character in several places, there\u2019s a system in place to allow you to do so easily!\n\nWe\u2019re not just a group RP. Most of our stories happen between partners, so if you\u2019re uncomfortable roleplaying in a group, you won\u2019t have to! Of course, if groups are your thing, that\u2019s always an option!\n\nYou can read more about the Rift here https://sites.google.com/view/therift/home\n\nOr, if you want to join the server directly https://discord.gg/NRbTPHk",

            "selftext": "***Howdy y'all! &lt;3***\n\nHope you all are having a nice day/night at the time of reading this! I'm posting here today to hopefully find some partners! Before I jump into what I'm looking for, I'd like to tell you all a little bit about myself so you all can see whether we will be compatible or not!\n\nI'm a 20 year old female full-time college student from the West Coast of the United States. I'm currently on my summer break, which means I have a lot of free time! I love anime and video games, along with going out with friends. Recently, I went to Anime Expo for the first time and it was a lot of fun! I've also gotten into my first mmo, Final Fantasy 14 which also been great fun!\n\nI've been roleplaying for around 6 years now, starting off on Instagram and Kik with dedicated RP accounts. Over the years, I've dabbled in multiple genres and settings, now having done just about everything! My favorite types of roleplays are ones with action and romance, as I enjoy exploring a developing relationship between characters. Some other genres/settings I've enjoyed are horror, slice of life, fantasy, modern, and cyberpunk. My usual response length varies from 1-3 paragraphs.\n\nSince that's out of the way, now we can talk about what I'm looking for! Obviously with the title, I'm looking for partners for a longterm Romance/Action RP based an existing fandom. To clarify, I'd like the RP to have romance as a central part of it, but the overall focus will be on a story we can come up with together. I'm open to coming up with an original story set within a universe, coming up with an entirely new AU, or having a crossover between fandoms. Listed below are the characters I want to play the most:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***NieR -***  **Kain\u00e9** \n\n***NieR Automata - YoRHa Model 2B***\n\n***Goblin Slayer - High Elf Archer***\n\n***SAO - Sinon (Shino Asada)***\n\n***FFVI - Terra Branford, Celes Chere***\n\n***FFVII - Tifa Lockhart, Yuffie Kisaragi, Jessie***\n\n***FFVIII - Quistis Trepe, Selphie Tilmitt***\n\n***FFXIII - Lightning Farron***\n\n***FFXIV - WoL (OC),*** **Y'shtola Rhul, Lyse Hext, Jessie Jaye** \n\n***FFXV - Iris Amicitia, Aranea Highwind***\n\n***Metroid - Samus Aran***\n\n***Attack on Titan - Mikasa Ackermann, Annie Leonhart***\n\n***Dead or Alive - Kasumi, Mila, Kokoro***\n\n***Evangelion - Asuka Langley Shikinami***\n\n***Kill la Kill - Ryuko Matoi, Satsuki Kiryuin***\n\n***Resident Evil - Jill Valentine, Claire Redfield, Ada Wong***\n\n***Rainbow Six Siege - Ela Bosak,*** **Monika \"IQ\" Weiss** \n\n***Overwatch - Elizabeth Caledonia \"Calamity\" Ashe, Hana Song (D.va),*** ***Angela Ziegler*** (***Mercy)***\n\n***League of Legends - Akali (KDA)***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPhew! Long list but I figure its better to have a full list instead of leaving anyone out. For my partners, feel free to pick another character from the same series, come up with an OC, or pick someone from a different series to play as! I'm open to all pairings, just ask! In addition, I'm open to playing OCs in some fandoms, such as FFXV and Resident Evil. You can also ask about different fandoms not listed, such as Silent Hill or Gundam! I'm also open to adult and lewd scenes, but I would like it if it didn't take up the whole RP. \n\nIf you made it to the end of this post, congrats! I know it is a lot but I didn't want to leave anything out! If you would like to RP with me, please PM on here with a little bit about yourself, the character you would like me to play or the fandom you would like to do, along with your Discord username. To make sure you read through everything, **please also include your favorite movie of 2019 so far or I will be ignoring your message!** Hope to hear from you all soon!",

I like to think I am good enough when it comes to writing, and I enjoy finding new partners to play with. Hopefully I will be able to find someone with similar interests, so without further ado, here's some info:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* looking to roleplay over **Discord**\n* looking for a **male or female** roleplayer (ALWAYS over 18, preferably older, closer to my age) who is comfortable with roleplaying males\n* I enjoy **long(er) posts** \\- this of course depends on the situation within the roleplay itself, but I am an avid reader. Chances you will write TOO much are minimal. That being said, a long post doesn't always equal a good one. As long as you give me something to work with (and vice versa), and manage to do so in a few sentences, we're good!\n* **genres** \\- I am currently looking to do some slice of life, modern, modern with paranormal elements, or dystopian. Fantasy is fine by me, too.\n* **fandoms** \\- don't dabble in those. I enjoy being inspired by certain ones, but I never roleplay as an established character from any universe.\n* **romance** \\- this is a must. I enjoy romantic aspects a lot, but I also enjoy build up and common sense. Romance can be the main point of the roleplay, but I'm perfectly fine with it being a nice addition to it.\n* **adult content -** I don't shy away from it at all. Enjoy it, even. Once again, build up and common sense are included in the package.\n* **posting schedule** \\- I am, most likely, dealing with a different timezone than the majority here. I don't mind slower pace, as long as we communicate.\n* that being said, **OOC chat** \\- I *love* getting to know my partners. It makes the story more fun, and keeps the whole experience light and enjoyable. While I won't force anyone to chat with me, know that I am always happy to write and make friends.\n* on the topic of **communication**  \\- please know what you're looking for and don't hesitate to tell me. A good roleplay is only fun when both people get something from it, and we don't sit in each other's heads to know what the other person wants.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for your time! If you're interested, contact me via reddit. You can leave your Discord tag there, or we can discuss things here first. Please don't use the reddit chat system, I am known to not check it regularly enough.",

I've got full a decade of experience under my belt. I write multiple paragraphs per response, usually three or four for an average, but length can be negotiated. No one liners or text talk, I require literate roleplays, otherwise I lose interest.\n\nI'm here looking for someone to do a Deltarune roleplay with, with my preference for the character I play as being Susie. Deltarune would be preferred for the setting, but I can work with Undertale and it's AUs as well. I'm open to discussing potential plots and genres with whoever responds, just shoot me a message or leave a comment, and I'll get to you.\n\nI would prefer to roleplay on Discord, if possible.",

We\u2019ve even got our own future events set out for characters from a future timeline.\n\nOur RP doesn\u2019t lock you down in one place, either.

They are the reason that the neon lights, holographic billboards, and towering skyscrapers continue to exist. They are the reason none can threaten the Land of the Neon Sun's place in the world. They are the reason this country is invincible.\r\n\r\nThe most highly regarded in society are the Samurai. No matter whether they be clad in suits, gi and hakama, or sophisticated battle armor and cybernetics, they all are known by the two blades they carry. Whether they be a member of the Families, or serving one of the Clans that exist outside their influence, they are the most privileged. Though public opinion of them varies, for there are those among their ranks both pure and wicked, few dared to stand against a Samurai. To do so was to invite death.\r\n\r\n**UNDER**\r\n\r\nBut times have changed. The Samurai grew too complacent, too sure of their place in society. Two years ago, a powerful, influential, and highly-skilled Samurai was struck down by a Commoner in bright city-light. The truth of the Samurai was written in the crimson that leaked out of him. The Samurai were Man. And no Man is invincible.\r\n\r\nThe Families tried to tighten their hold over the country, but they had forever lost that mystical quality they once had. Many still fear the Samurai, but there are now those who see them for the humans they are, who see them for the red fluid they bleed when cut. Civil unrest has started to take root within the great walls of the country. Commoners, tired of being treated as worms beneath the blade, have begun to fight back against the Samurai. Some insult them as they pass, some close their store doors to them, and some challenge them to duels in the middle of the city streets.\r\n\r\nThe revolution is not here, but you can see it in the distance. The Age of Samurai is coming to an end. But there are those who fear the Neon Sun will set with it. Passed down in tales from parent to child, grandparent to grandchild, is the memory of what the nation was like before the Samurai. It's a fading memory, but it's still there. Faint, vague murmurings of a great, Eldritch horror that existed before it was sealed away under the city's streets paved in neon.\r\n\r\n**THE NEON SUN**\r\n\r\nTake a drag. Take a drink. Take a shot of LOVE+ if that's your poison. Look out from your condo balcony. Look out from the ground-floor window of your ramshackle rental unit. Look out from the tinted window of your car that's had its passenger seat ripped out to make room for a bug-infested mattress. You've been here all your life, but what have you made of it? Are you a Samurai? Perhaps a Ronin, exiled and shamed by your Clan. Or maybe you're just a Commoner, longing for the end of the Samurai or to join their ranks.\r\n\r\nThis world is moving with or without you. A new century is dawning, whether you help to shape it or not. Pull up your boots. Screw in your artificial arm. Get going. The Land of the Neon Sun is a place that swallows men whole, but there are still those who emerge from its depths victorious.\r\n\r\n---\n\r\nThis is a Cyberpunk RP with heavy Japanese and Eastern influences, taking place in a far future. I'll be acting as the GM, and you as the player. I will control the world and characters around you as you try to make your way towards greatness, or to whatever goal your character has for themselves.\r\n\r\nWhat I've laid out is just a taste, an idea of the world your character will inhabit. Everything is open to further discussion, and we can agree to add and change things to this world as well. If you're interested, shoot me a message and we'll start discussing the RP. I prefer Discord to RP and talk on, but I might be convinced to use other applications instead. Since I'll be acting as the GM, I'll be a bit limited as to how many RPs I can take on, sorry! Anyway, I hope to hear from a few of you, and I hope we can make a story together that's really something special!",

            "selftext": "Hello!\n\nSo I had an idea for a historical roleplay. Now it can take place in a few different times and places. But the premise is basically the same.\n\nAs American troops began to ship out to Europe for WW2 their leaders knew they would need something to eliviate their boredom and keep them entertain. And so many were equipped with a radio. Not for military purpose. But to simply entertain to foot soldier. However it didn't take long for the enemy to use this against them. \n\nWW2 \nAxis Sally\n\nBased from Berlin, born in America she would feed lies about the war, the state of America back home and how the fronts were going.\n\nTokyo Rose \nBased out of Tokyo Japan much like her German counterpart she would feed misinformation in order to demoralize the troops. However unlike her German counterpart she would grow dissolisiouned with the Japanese war effort and secretly hoped for an American win.\n\n\nKorean war:\nSally Seoul\n\nBroadcasting from recently occupied Seoul, Sally would lack the musical and material equipment and tracks that the ones before her had. Relying only on her voice to sow mistrust and hopelessness in her enemies. \n\nVietnam War:\nHanoi Hannah \n\nThe one that would become famous. That every Vietnam vet remembers. Her silky soft voice would intimidate and scare many American troops and would also become a source of news for them. More is known about her having learned English at an early age. And while she is fascinated by the West..she truly despises the US involvement in Vietnam.\n\n\n\n\nThese are the most famous different radio hosts that have tried to sow fear in to the hearts of soldiers. And I would like to try a roleplay where I would play just one of those soldiers. Who is later captured and eventually brought to you. Now, who will turn who.. what will happen beyond that I leave up in the air as each story deserves to be different.",

            "selftext": "Hello there! \nI'm female, 20, in the PNW timezone but I can be flexible. I'm very versatile when it comes to my roleplays. I love falling in love with characters - making playlists, moodboards, stories, etc. for the characters or couples. If you aren't comfortable with specific themes, please let me know. I have a preference for intense plots and characters which means it usually involves adult themes, gore, or NSFW situations. If you aren't comfortable with something, let me know so I can adjust. I don't expect paragraphs or book length for every reply. I prefer to see you put effort into your response. Don't get me excited for the roleplay and then skip out last minute just as we are starting. I prefer to control my own character how I please. I go back and forth between 3rd or 1st point of view depending on the character or situation. Let me know if you have a preference.\n\nWhat I'm interested in roleplaying - \nDetroit: Become Human, Wentworth, Skins, Euphoria, Degrassi, The Society, Sherlock, American Gods, Umbrella Academy, The OA, Lucifer, Misifts, Preacher, Legends of Tomorrow, Gotham, Agents of Shield, Daredevil, Punisher, Peaky Blinders, Vikings, Sense8, The Vampire Diaries &amp; The Originals, Marvel, DC, Mythology, Time Travel, Occult &amp; Supernatural, Superpowers, Horror, Crime, Thriller, Mafia, Serial Killers, Criminals. I have a preference for dark backstories, intense characters, and thrilling plots. \n\nI can roleplay over google docs or reddit, but I would prefer to roleplay over discord or tumblr! \nIf you are interested, please let me know!! Thank you.",

I have to inform I only do OC's and I don't do fandom roleplays. I like having freedom to come up with worlds and characters of my own. This being said, I also like long-term roleplays with \"constant\" change to the plot. This can also include adding new characters and removing others from the story-line. I'm all about keeping it interesting, which brings me to the next point.  \n\n\nI am a drama queen. I get *very* easily bored, so I like to keep things exciting and dramatic at most times. Not that it has to be one long action scene, but I'm not too much into playing through every single meal our characters have, or describe an entire night of sleep. I love being descriptive, but it's troubling for me to describe things that simple without being repetitive or really weird.   \n\n\nI think that's the most basic things, if you're somewhat interested, shoot me a message and we can figure out if we're compatible.

            "selftext": "To anyone whom may be viewing, welcome. \n\nI am on the search for a Star Wars themed role-play with an emphasis of including the character Darth Maul. However, I am also seeking to dwell into the popular genre of romance with action, drama and suspense. \n\n* For a little background Maul has always been one of my favorite sith villains in the entire franchise and his ever expanding character development has intrigued me from the very beginning. As I\u2019m sure...we all have that one character that clicks for us.\n\nThis role would take place either during the Clone Wars or Rebels (take note of the title) universe. My character would be a female human Jedi spending her days thriving and surviving in the time of war. With that being said I am looking for a partner who would be willing to play Maul. (I also wouldn\u2019t mind playing as a canon character if you\u2019d prefer). \n\nThe plot is a simple one in which this female Jedi and Sith have developed an understanding for each other that has blossomed into something forbidden. They have spent many years keeping a low profile on their shared relation but things always almost prove to be difficult for the pair. With the brink of War and Mauls death it seems as though the two would never come face to face again. \n\nIn the years before the New Hope a Galactic Empire has risen, hunting down the last of the Jedi while new rebellions form. With this female Jedi missing and a well alive Maul thirsting for vengeance perhaps the two will meet again? \n\nThis is a rough idea and I would love to come up with a more complex plot if necessary. I want to thank everyone who has read this far. \n\nNow a little bit about me...\n* I have been role-playing for about 5+ years.\n* I prefer third person but will do first.\n* I tend to write multiple paragraphs and would prefer my partner do the same. However, one is just fine if that is more comfortable. (Let me know your preference).\n\nIf anyone is interested go ahead and reply to this post or send over a PM. Either is fine by me! I would be happy to answer and address any questions or concerns you may have. We can also discuss where to role-play! \n\nHope everyone is having a splendid day. Happy role-playing!",

If this is something that appeals to you, don't be afraid to reach out for more details. We have around 16 people so far and are always open to new people.\n\nThe Island of Dr. Moreau (or the Island of Lost Souls as the discord server is known) is based upon H.G. Well's original novel but with a few twists (including a reversal of the central idea) and a modern setting. Design your own human character, and see how they thrive and struggle against a mad doctor and his genetic experimentation on a remote Pacific island. Needless to say, lots of changes are coming.\n\nDuke it out with Epoch Pharmaceuticals' gallery of unstable scientists and scheming corporate suits. Forge new friendships and rivalries with the other islanders. Prepare yourself for an eventual final confrontation with Doctor Moreau himself. The choice is yours, should you choose to journey to the Island of Lost Souls.\n\nPM me if interested.",
