Anyway, I'm looking for a cool writing partner. You've just gotta be up for anything and understand that creative freedom and open communication are important for teamwork and collaboration!\n\nI enjoy dark themes. Psychological Horror, Supernatural, Paranormal, Thriller. All of it! I prefer character-focused writing and playing multiple characters throughout. It's also more fun with high-stakes and unpredictability. These are people and people die. Let's get attached, so it hurts. (Obviously, we should discuss the deaths of our characters beforehand, unless we decide to kill our own character, then surprise!) We should be exploring human behavior and emotions, delving into wicked storytelling!\n\nLet me know if you're interested! I'd love to get to know you as much as you'd like, and discuss plots and writing styles. I write mature content, so I only write with other adults.",

I have 3+ years of roleplay experience, so I am definitely capable of a variety of styles and genres to roleplay in, though most of my roleplays are slice-of-life romance roleplays, MxM to be precise. I am not comfortable doing a romance roleplay with a female character, though if you yourself are female and you wish to roleplay as male, that is completely fine.\n\nI love to talk outside of the roleplay as well, and I have to be blunt about it; I have an eccentric personality, and my favourite type of humour can be viewed as offensive by some, you are hereby warned. If you are incapable of handling offensive jokes or comments you are not the person I am looking for. I do not set out to offend, it is just that my humour and certain opinions are sometimes viewed as offensive by more sensitive people. Now then, for the roleplay, I have set up some basic rules that you must be able to oblige.\n\n* AT LEAST 5 full sentences per response\n* Third-person\n* Past tense\n* Grammatically correct\n* At least one response per day\n* Be committed to Roleplay! I don't want to roleplay for a month only to be ghosted when you just don't feel like it anymore (sorry if that sounds blunt but I do not want to be invested in a roleplay again only to be ghosted and having to find someone else again) \n\nI really hope that I have piqued your interest and you are willing to roleplay with me. I use discord as my roleplaying platform, so you will have to give me your discord username through PM if you wish to roleplay with me.\n\nP.S, I am on top!",

            "selftext": " \n\nEveryone knows about the X-Men or something of a similar nature. People gifted with incredible powers due to a defect in their genes. Well, it turns out that truth, like in many cases, is far stranger than fiction. Not only do these genes exist, but most people have them. People go every day with these genes and never activate them. Of course, they're not like we see in the comics and movies, they don't activate when most convenient in order to save the hero\u2019s life. If that were the case, thousands if not millions of people would have been saved by their own genetics. No, these genes have to be activated through advanced medical procedures, only recently discovered and costing nearly millions just for one patient. All of this information was, and still is, kept under wraps since the \u201960s. After the first discovery of the gene, the original carrier was promptly examined, a human guinea pig if you will. Soon, another person was taken, then another, then another. Most, if not all of those studied contained a very similar gene that didn\u2019t seem to correlate to what we knew before like hair color or things of that nature. They were far more. Ever since then, a group of scientists known solely as The Organization worked tirelessly to find out just how to unlock the true potential behind this gene and bring forth the next step in human evolution. The organization works directly with the U.S government as an off the books group sworn to secrecy.\n\nAfter a very tightly monitored and rough selection process, they\u2019ve agreed to give up their lives in order to treat and care for these mutants, abandoning friends and family alike. This group has basically destroyed all trace of themselves, even managing to drop off the grid entirely, in order to pursue these scientific endeavors. Their goal is to advance human genetics, to create something better than a standard human. At the same time, they also wish to record the results of such endeavors, how the subjects respond to their new changes, what they\u2019re capable of. The endgame planned for these mutants is up in the air, no one truly knowing what the facility plans to use them for should these tests be a resounding success.\n\nWill you be the next subject? Or, will you stand by the facility and work tirelessly to advance mankind to its fullest potential? If interested, feel free to check out the server [here!](https://discord.gg/dcPwBRY) and see just what fun you can get into!",

            "selftext": "New to the RP side of Reddit but not to roleplaying. \n\nI've been rping for close to 15 years now and this is the first time I've made a post looking for a partner so I apologize in advance if this is a convoluted mess. \n\nI'm a 21+ very laid back F looking for a few chill long term writing/rp buddies. I've recently found myself with a lot of free time and a strong desire to start actively rping again. I'm semi-lit/literate, but I generally post match whoever I am rping with. With that said, I really enjoy reading people's writing and at least a paragraph is preferable. \n\nI'm not usually very comfortable writing as Canon chars so I ask that any rps we pursue be OCs. I am all for playing in an already established world though. \n\nGenres I'd like to get into currently are Horror, Zombie, Slice of Life, and Modern. Fandoms would be Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, Sword of Truth, honestly just ask and I'll probably be up for it. \n\nI am also hoping to find someone decently versed in DnD to do a Fantasy based rp with. I'm set to start my first DnD game and I'm nervous about the voice rping that will be expected from me. I'd love to find someone who wants to rp with the OC I've made so I can find her voice and get more comfortable with it. \n\nMy only limit is I don't want pure smut, if it furthers the story great! But sometimes it feels like people try to steer strictly for bedroom scenes and I would really like a partner that is focused on building relationships (Friendships, Romances, Family bonds, etc) and the world around our characters. I'm comfortable with dark, violent, gory, and overall scary themes.  I'm also quite ok with happy, sunshine, and unicorn storylines. \n\nI know this is incredibly vague and unhelpful but if I've peaked anyone's interest please feel free to message! I'm looking forward to building a world with someone!",

(Please let me know what you're comfortable writing!)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u2665  I need a collaborative partner who is willing to work on the setting, scene, NPCs, etc. with me! I hate putting all the energy into the story and not getting the same in return.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u2665  I'd love to write with someone who is down for the long haul! I get extremely emotionally invested in stories. OOC is cool and if we end up being friends, that's a plus for me!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u2665 I ask you respect me/my characters and I'll do the same for you!   \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u2665 No self-inserts, please! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's some **plots/ideas** I had, or some that have worked with other rps I've done!\n\n|[F0x](https://toyhou.se/4428994.f0x-sci-fi-) (replicant), Female, Science Fiction|Her[\u00a0**revelation**](https://toyhou.se/~literature/23731.revelation) about her identity leads her to run off into some bad business.

Now, I'm not an expert on any of that stuff, which is why we can create our world with our own rules! Now, here's all you should know about me:\n\nI use Discord, past tense and 3rd person. I love dark themes, twists and lots of details to make it more realistic! I can reply at least once a day if the roleplay is to my liking, along with lengthy paragraphs. I'm looking to challenge myself to write even more, so you shouldn't be afraid of lenght and details.\n\nAll that said, we can discuss ideas we can try out with OCs, but if you're familiar with the show Lucifer, I'd love to try something using its characters! Even if it's only Lucifer, if you know the show, would love to try something. That said, it's not necessary to be a fandom roleplay! We can try anything. \n\nI don't have any specific ideas, just vague ones, but I do have a knack for playing as the bad guy, so expect me to take up the role of a demon/fallen angel/the devil etc depending on the plot.\n\nThat's about it, send me a message if you're interested or maybe check out the rest of my ads and tell me if any idea appeals to you. All I ask of you is that you're under 30 and have a passion for roleplaying! Still, if you do PM me, also mention your favourite number so that I know you read all of this (thank you for doing so) and have a great day!",

            "selftext": "# A New Tale Awaits You! Join The One Piece Odyssey RPG!\n\nThe Pirate King, Noland Sal, died 30 years ago. He started an age of piracy known as the Great Age\u2014one that was truly greater than any before it. The Four Emperors of the seas were crowned, the navy grew faster and stronger than ever before, and the Warlords were formulated in response to the growing imbalance in the world. Despite nearly an entire era of piracy passing before you were even able to walk,  the power that resides in Noland Sal's dying inscription still resonates deeply within the adventurers of tomorrow. Set sail, dream big, and flourish with great resolve\u2014might it be as a marine, a pirate, a revolutionary, or even a world government agent\u2014your journey starts in the Blue Sea. The One Piece is still out there, and time will continue to run its course. It is up to you to use your time on the seas in a manner that fits your intentions.\n\nA new age and a new tale await you\u2014whether your adversaries are prepared for it or not.\n\nOne Piece Odyssey RPG: Tale of the Seas is an immersive roleplay that takes multiple aspects from the famous Dungeon and Dragons franchise. Start with up to two professions that have unique skill paths, roll for various situations, choose the race of your dreams, and so much more!\n\nThis roleplay has various elements, including:\n\n* A full-fledged economy system, complete with taxes, an integrated shop, black market dealings, business ventures, trade, etc.\n* A detailed character creation process that goes step-by-step with stellar descriptions.\n* Templates to submit various things, including entire structures, weapons, and inventions.\n* Entirely hand-crafted lore that still feels very One Piece-like.\n* Completely original characters with no hint of the latter being from the canonical storyline.\n* A devil fruit system that brings light to the rarity of the delicacy.\n* A roleplaying guide that has more than 120 pages, alongside lore with more than 25. (Complete with an outline for both, so do not worry about constant scrolling!)\n* Simple stats with skills to go with them\u2014alongside an easy to understand combat system that incorporates both logic and probability into many circumstances (hence the DnD inspiration.)\n* Events that reward effort, activity, and skill over anything else.\n* A fully-functioning newspaper that is updated every week with the greatest feats in that time period\u2014including a bounty section where the most notable wanted posters are posted.\n* A completely interactive storyline that is based on your actions.\n\nAlthough we are young, we hope to grow and become a memorable variant of the many One Piece roleplays out there. If you are hesitant to possibly do something out of your roleplaying comfort zone, just give us a try! A lot of work has gone into the development of this server, and we will try our best not to disappoint!\n\nNote: We prefer to have detail-driven roleplayers who will give great effort in their posts, portray emotion, and give their character's personality. If you are a new roleplayer and wish to join, please be open to criticism if we do not find you up to par with our standards. We are willing to help young, inexperienced individuals grow as writers\u2014as long as they are willing to listen and learn as well. Alongside that, it should be noted that this is a One Piece roleplay at heart, and the addition of \"odyssey\" simply means that this will be going on for quite some time.\n\nThank you so much for reading! I hope you find us interesting. The documents that are mentioned above will be available in the discord\u2014please make sure your account is older than 3 days or you will not be able to join until then.\n\nDiscord Link: [https://discord.gg/csC9GcX](https://discord.gg/csC9GcX)\n\n*PLEASE NOTE: We have NOT started yet, this is a great time to join!*",

You loved your video games and you spent countless hours in MMOs and various online games to the point that it effected your grades in your senior year. You don\u2019t know how it happened but while screwing around and prioritizing fun most of your life you found yourself working in a gas station for minimum wage.\n\nYour life was slowly sinking into despair and the reality escape that is video games is becoming less and less effective as you start accumulating debt. Just when your life was about to fall apart something that will change your life forever happened.\n\nYou always loved shows where people would go inside games and have another chance at life but who would have imagined your own life becoming a game. A life where your success and your future depends on how well you can kill monsters.\n\nThe rules if the game that is your life now was simple:\n1-Upon making a request from someone you will be transported into a dungeon. Clearing the dungeon will mean that your request will be granted by that person.\n2-The bigger the request the harder the dungeon. Something like saying \u201cshut up\u201d will create an E ranked dungeon. And it scales up to S ranked dungeons for much larger requests.\n3-you will level up and gain strength as you kill monsters but all your powers will only work in dungeons.\n4-Although they are rare, drop items are the only thing that can be brought back to the real world meaning it could improve your life directly.\n5-Dungeons will be created from the persons personality, so requesting from good people will result in easier dungeons.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nHello there r/Roleplay!

During Cyberpunk 2020, Night City is said to have a population of more than five million inhabitants. However, this number has considerably grown in 2077. The population is now reaching six and a half million. \n\nFollowing an economic collapse sometime during the early 21st century, the United States is forced to rely on large corporations to survive. These corporations deal in a wide range of areas, such as weapons, robotics, cybernetics, pharmaceuticals, communications and biotechnology, and many of these companies operate above the law. \n\nWill you be a corporate billionaire, a corrupt cop, a tech-savvy hacker or a nomad? Will you focus more on style or survival? Do you fight the system or *create* the system? \n\nThere are endless opportunities, but just remember: *Nobody ever leaves Night City... Except in a body bag.*\n\n**Keep in mind that this is NOT directly connected to any specific cyberpunk game. (Not 2013/2020/2077). However it is set in that world.**\n\n\ud83d\udca5This is a literate RP \n\ud83d\udca518+ Only \n\nhttps://discord.gg/6xEcRAy",

            "selftext": " \n\nNew Year\u2019s Eve: the night of the year we vow to never forget, or be intoxicated enough to never remember in the first place. However, for some like Katherine, all she\u2019d like to do is forget. She\u2019d begged to stay in, perhaps watch one of the theatrical television productions and call it a night. What could be better than starting a new year with a good night\u2019s sleep?\n\nApparently, this party. Annabelle practically forced her into going. Her best friend tended to be quite the opposite of her. Where Anna enjoyed large crowds and endless opportunities to socialise, Kate wanted the complete opposite. The two friends even appeared radically different. Anna\u2019s hair was a dark chestnut brown that curled down her back, Kate\u2019s was a straight blond. Anna\u2019s hazel eyes felt warm, where Kate\u2019s blues were hesitant, sometimes chilling. Kate was tall; Anna was not. Katherine was a world-famous singer; Anna was, err, not. \n\nAnd yet, the short, rambunctious Anna got Kate to begin curling her hair into loose waves and threw dress after dress at her. She settled on a silk black gown, braiding a few loose strands of her hair back and pinning them up. Off the two girls went to have radically different nights. They started out together, drinking at the open bar, before Anna\u2019s attention was drawn away and she was pulled to dance. Kate still hung onto her gin and tonic, but headed towards the elevator instead. \n\nShe called the elevator and when it arrived, she stepped in and turned around to press the button to return to the lobby when she made eye contact, across the hall, with a stranger. The contact was held, although the door would shut any minute now...\n\nHi! I will be playing Katherine Comer, as described above. You can make your character to be whoever you\u2019d like, but they\u2019re at the party for /some/ reason, whatever it may be. For this roleplay, I\u2019m open to it going in any direction you\u2019d like. Whether it be a light-hearted slow-burn romance, an action-packed mystery, or something darker, I\u2019m all ears. However, it won\u2019t be completely smut or NSFW. Story is very important to me and collaboratively forming it with my partner. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested at all or have any questions, don\u2019t hesitate to message me. I\u2019m currently in the EST, although I am European but will not be returning to that time zone until a later date. Cheers xx",

Like, let's chat a bit and see how compatible we are. It's always way nicer like that in my opinion. \n\nI'm a girl from Finland and I'm looking someone to write a roleplay with, I don't have the most experience and I might make some grammatical mistakes here and there, but I promise that I'm always trying my best.\nI'm also fine with any kind of pairings, fxm, fxf, mxm, just tell me which one you prefer!\nI'm open to about any kind of genre, but my absolute favorites have to be romance and fantasy. I also am completely okay with smut and all that, but I hate it if it's the main part of the roleplay. Please let's build an actual story and have the sex as a side thing.\n\nI write in third person, past tense and with my own oc's.\nI'm open to any kind of suggestions for a plot that we could write, but I also have one or two of my own.\n\nI also prefer writing in Discord.

I prefer to play female against a male - though, I can be coaxed into doing MxM. I do often play male side characters z I don't fine them hard to play, I'm just more comfortable with playing female.\n\n-I usually write 5-8 paragraphs for the starter, though tend to gravitate towards 1-4 paragraphs for later replies.\n\n-I do a lot of art! I'll most likely do some for us, if I enjoy our roleplay! I'm also really friendly OOC and love finding songs/making playlists for our characters, coming up with AUs, ETC.\n\n-I can reply multiple times a day - I'm a fast writer. \n\n\nSo, here are some requirements. \n\n-Please tell me if you're gonna be gone for a while - I don't wanna think you're dead or something.\n\n-Please be at least a tad active. I only require a minimum of one post a day unless you're busy.\n\n-Please be ready to play a male! I'm not the most comfortable with FxF or FxM (with me playing the guy).\n\n-Please use somewhat correct grammar, punctuation and spelling! \n\n-Please be around the same literacy level. \n\n\nNow, onto some genres I'm into.\n\nCanon and OC welcome! I'm not good with canon, so I'll stick to OC.\n\n-Superheroes! I'm really into developing this villain gal I have. If you wanna play literally any Marvel character I'll die for you - but OCs are welcome!\n\n-Historyish plots. I have a plot thing where a modern gal enters history through a book - usually I use it for western plots, though it can be used for anything!\n\n-Fantasy! I have a few dragons I can use for that kinda plot.\n\nI'm open to anything, though!\n\nIf interested, send me a PM with some info about you, what plot you're looking for, and maybe a writing example! I'll send my Discord info if I'm interested!",

I often don't put too much about myself here because If you're truly interested I often prefer you ask me yourself!\n\nI'm looking for a partner interested in playing stories that have a Cyberpunk aesthetic or backdrop. Think Blade Runner, Deus Ex, etc. I like stories that involve crime in massive cities, where it feels like they're just a tiny drop in the pond. I want to play either an android of some type (Think Ghost in the Shell, human brain with robot body). This character could either be a female or male (Looking to perhaps experiment as playing a feminine-appearing guy!) or play a Rookie-Cop who is filled with naivety for making the world a better place and fighting the good fight.\\~\n\nI actually would like sex to be a big part of the story; Whether it be the giant neon women who are naked and advertising robots for pleasure, or strip clubs, etc. I also want sex at some point to either be a thing that happens to between our characters, or various moments of hesitant arousal. \n\nWith that being said, I prefer the feminine-genders, but am willing to to play across anyone on a good story!\n\nI'm very friendly and approachable, but I dislike writers who can't atleast give me two para's a reply. If you are someone who isn't able to hit that criteria, or isn't sure, then It would be best for you to move on. \u2665 PM me if interested!

            "selftext": "Hello! I\u2019m back from an extended hiatus with a renewed itch for RP! Before I get to the plots, a bit about myself and what I\u2019m looking for down below.\n\nI\u2019m an experienced roleplayer with 5~6 years experience. I typically write 3+ paragraphs per post and write in third person perspective and in the past tense. I exclusively use Discord as a platform to RP on since it\u2019s easier for notifications and organization.\n\nI ask that a potential RP buddy has as much experience as myself and is collaborative in the writing process. I\u2019m open to romance and smut as long as it\u2019s not the entire focus and it\u2019s not forced. That being said, I\u2019d prefer that you be 21+. I\u2019m also open to dark themes and the like however we ought to go over limits to know boundaries.\n\nWith that out of the way, onto my current cravings:\n\n- True Crime: Two detectives are made partners to help solve a string of grisly and violent murders throughout the city. Between dealing with all sorts of criminals and balancing their personal problems, can they find their killer before their leads go cold?\n\n\n- Homecoming: A man haunted by his past returns to his hometown after receiving news of a tragic death in his family. Upon arrival, he sees that things have only went from bad to worse for the town, but stays to try set things right with himself and his family and friends.\n\n\n- Under Western Skies: Set in the old west, an outlaw tries to settle down and escape his history of violence. It\u2019s not long until his life is thrown back into turmoil and danger when his past catches up with him.\n\nThose are the main plots I\u2019ve been wanting to do for a while. I kept them a bit vague so there\u2019s room for us to modify them to fit whatever story/pairings we really want to tell. If you think I might be the perfect fit for writing a different role in one of your ideas, feel free to reach out! Hope to hear from you!",

            "selftext": "In this world there are hundreds of kingdoms and nations, yet none in all of its history has there been one as expansive and fearsome as the Elysian Empire. Two centuries ago, this kingdom set itself upon a violent warpath, conquering and absorbing all bordering lands. Their expansion increased exponentially and at current day, they control a third of all known land in the world. Their warmongering casts a looming shadow over all others who have not yet seen Elysian banners raised in their castle halls.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nScholars have labored over Elysian history, pondering as to how one kingdom could grow so large without experiencing collapse, and one primary cause points toward their complete disposal of old tradition. Where some kingdoms would burn magic wielders at the stake, the Empire would see mages in every battalion, using their spells to shift the tide of battle at a moment's notice. Other kingdoms would discriminate against \"demi\" races; dwarves, elves, orcs, and others still face persecution in many kingdoms, but the Empire sees all who would serve it as equal. Where many kingdoms would never allow a woman to pick up a spear, the Elysians would come to find its armies nearly double by giving every healthy woman the opportunity to fight for the Empire just as a man could. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhere the Empire succeeds in matters of equality, it also employs methods of brutal efficiency in its conquests. When an enemy kingdom falls to the Empire, the entire royal line is slaughtered, from the monarch down to the last baby. Any noble family that steps out of line is given the same treatment, until one arrives that is too frightened to ever dare stand up to their new rulers. Noble families are picked over, with children taken as wards to become imperial knights or to be married to imperial nobles, spreading Elysian blood in order to assimilate the population over the course of generations.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBeing the princess of a proud kingdom, you had read the stories time and again. Even so, you never once imagined that such a horror could befall your land.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUntil it did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYour kingdom was a strong one, lasting just over a year against the militarily superior Empire. Even so, your land fell the same as all the others. Your father lost his life, with his male heirs either dead or unaccounted for after the fighting ended. You were locked in a tower within your castle, each day expecting your death to come. That is what became of all ruling families who fell to the Empire. Two weeks passed, each day bringing no answers, only a silent imperial knight to bring you meals. It was only early this morning that you were informed that you will not be executed. Instead, you are to marry one of the Emperor's sons, and rule your home alongside him. Furthermore, you have just learned that your wedding is tonight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHey everyone, I hope you like the concept. As you can see, I already have a great deal written about my character's home, but intentionally left the details vague regarding your character. We can work on it together or you can come up with the details on your own. So, this is meant to be a (hopefully long term) romantic roleplay with drama, political intrigue, and probably a bit of action along the way. I will be playing the Imperial Prince whereas you, of course, will be playing the Princess. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI encourage you to give her whatever sort of personality you think would be most interesting. Frightened damsel in distress? Headstrong warrior princess? Something in between? Whatever you want! If you would rather play a guy and be a prince, I would have no issue playing a princess instead. The prompt works either way. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am happy to write in either first or third person. My replies tend to be a few paragraphs on average but change depending on what the story calls for at the time. I do tend to employ a large cast of supporting characters in my roleplays to make the world feel more 'alive', but the prince I am playing will always be the main character. If you are interested in this prompt, please DM me. I would love to discuss this more with you.",

            "selftext": "LITERATE ONLY, SPOILER WARNING FOR DBS: BROLY\n\nI need someone, male or female, to play Cheelai for a Broly x Cheelai Roleplay. This will take place after the events of the movie where Broly, Cheelai, and Lemo head to Earth to start a better life. Broly has adapted to a more modern society, so he isn't the same sort of wild barely tamable beast he usually is. He's much more civilized now, though he still has a lot to learn.  \n\n\nStarter: Broly flew over West City, bags of groceries in his hands. He had been living on Earth for about one year now, and it had been three years since he and his father had arrived with Frieza. Those moments still haunted him to his core. The death of his father, the berserk uncontrollable power he had tapped into, not to mention the absolutely humiliating way he lost. Still though, there was one thing...no, one person who made it all worth it. Cheelai had given him a chance when nobody else would, and for that he was grateful. No, in fact he was much more than just grateful. He had feelings for her that were...odd, to say the least. Growing up on Vampa there weren't many things he had grown attached to, save for his father and Bah, the latter of whom's ear stayed wrapped around his waist. As he spotted the house down in the woods that he lived at, he landed at the door and ducked down in order to fit through it. \"I'm home...\" He said, looking around the house. Lemo had decided to go back to the Frieza Force, so it was just him and Cheelai at this point. He wasn't happy about being left by one of his friends, but Kakarot made Lemo promise to visit so it was fine by him. Kakarot had shown Broly such respect after all he had done, and this confused him quite a bit at first. Nevertheless, he was happy to call Kakarot his friend. As he heard soft footsteps approaching he reached into the bag and took out a piece of broccoli he had bought, then took the end off a mop and covered the broccoli head with it in order to simulate her hair. After this he jammed his finger into it and made a rather weird looking smiley face, his way of \"Drawing\" her. He wasn't used to showing affection, and at least this was better than his last attempt. He blew up an entire field trying to write her name in the ground with energy blasts, so at least this didn't involve any major destruction. As she approached him he swiftly held it out in front of her, keeping his same serious expression with a bit of a pink glow added to his cheeks. \"For...you.",

            "selftext": "Hi there! Are you a boy or girl above the age of 16? Are you fascinated with ancient cultures and civilizations? Do you want to involve yourself in and help build a casual and low-stress roleplay community? Then First Cohort is for you! First Cohort follows the story of of Legio X Victoria, a fictional Roman Legion during the reign of Emperor Trajan, 98 CE - 117 CE. Your character can come from any culture in the Old World as long as you provide a reason for them being in Rome.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce you've created your character, you'll be officially welcomed into the Legion's first cohort, or its Auxiliary divisions. From there, you'll be able to take on missions and challenges to improve your renown and earn a name for yourself. Through hard work and dedication, you may one day be able to reach the officer class, and command soldiers of your own! Take heed, though, for the ancient world is full of mysterious perils, and the Legion always has foes to fight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf this sounds like a roleplay you'd be interested in, feel free to send me a message! If I like the cut of your jib, I'll send you a link to the Discord server, and you can get started on your character! The community is still quite small, so I'll only be letting in a few people for now, until a solid foundation has been built. I hope you make the cut! Roma Invicta!",

I'm interested in one on one context mainly with group roleplays also possible via Discord. I write about the acting business (from a true to life standpoint, I'm an actor in RL remaining anonymous). I do write real people but with a strong AU twist on their back stories, much as if their lives were an actually scripted tv show with its intricate characteristics and plot points.\n\nCurrently I portray Cole Sprouse, from ''Riverdale'' fame. I'm looking for all kinds of connections. Friends, family, LI. I'm down to mix things up a bit. I already have a pre-established storyline dealing with drugs, and bad parenting overall. I will be happy to send more info to those that would be into this sort of thing.\n\nAlso I have a specific Roleplayer profile for Cole. I'm down to write there, or Google Docs, or Discord.\n\nLook forward to discussing something ;)",

I also recently got a new app that shows when people request to chat with me. So if you sent one before I\u2019m sorry the other app wouldn\u2019t show it.\n\nSo I usually post exactly what I want but this time I want to leave the template open. I\u2019m a 19 year old male and I\u2019m looking for a partner to become friends with and not just write with. So if you\u2019re looking for only roleplay sorry!\n\nI\u2019ve been writing for about a decade and I can easily manipulate how much I do or don\u2019t write based off of how you write so don\u2019t be discouraged and think \u201cWell I can only write a paragraph in first person.\u201d That\u2019s completely fine! I\u2019m just searching for someone to grow with an be compatible with.\n\nI\u2019m fine with smut but I want it to make sense in the story. I don\u2019t want to rush anything because that makes longterms a lot more gratifying. If you\u2019re interested just let me know!",

            "selftext": "So it's been several months since I started roleplaying since I loved writing collabs with others years ago and I was dying to do some writing while I was in the military just a year ago, and so far my experiences have usually ended disappointingly.\n\nI understand it when people's lives get in the way. I even understand losing interest because I've been in a few with partners.\n\nBut something that's been irking me as of late, and been bubbling inside has been partners who refuse to express what they want out of the roleplay :/\n\nI love listening to people. I like to know what people want. I believe in strong communication so both parties, even if it leans towards my partner's interest, enjoy the roleplay as much as possible. \n\nI strongly dislike feeling like I'm railroading my partner into a story because I believe the partner comes first above my own interests. \n\nAnd yet I've had far too many partners who I don't tell me what they're looking for or what they're not and it just creates this pressure on me when there is so much unknowns. \n\nI had a recent potential partner who I asked several times what she'd like to do but instead she didn't answer and she just seemed wishy washy, which wasn't helped when I thoroughly tried giving my pitch and did my best to be as clear as possible. Eventually after all that she said we wouldn't connect because... Well, she didn't give an explanation. \n\nBut yeah, I'm just getting sorta tired of partners not being open or expressive. Yes I love confidence in characters, but I also want some of that to extend to my partners so I can best make the roleplaying and story writing as enjoyable as possible for them. \n\nI've already had a couple RPs that ended abruptly because the partner, who wasn't forthcoming, suddenly said they lost interest and I just feel like I could have prevented that if they said what they wanted.\n\nApologies, rant over :c",

            "selftext": "\nHello! I\u2019ll try and make this as easy to digest as possible. \n\n\nFirst things first: Let\u2019s not take ourselves too seriously, okay? I\u2019m trying to have fun, write some weird stuff, and make new friends. I look forward to learning what you like, and how you write. If something isn\u2019t going right or one of us just isn\u2019t feeling it, communication is key. \n\nAbout me: I go by Sunday. I\u2019m 21+ and would love for you, my prospective partner, to be as well. I\u2019ve been roleplaying since the days of my youth on Neopets. I\u2019ve always loved writing as a hobby, and have sadly let it get away from me in the past few years. \n\nAbout my writing: I like to use weird words to describe things. I like short sentences, long sentences, peppering in swear words. I write short replies (3 paragraphs) and I write looooong replies (10+ paragraphs). Whatever the scene calls for. I write third person only. \n\nAbout my characters: I prefer to play a male character, but I will gladly play any gender. I am very flexible. I like to double, triple, throw in all the characters that the scene or story needs. Or keep it intimate with just two mains. Whatever, you know? Flexible. That\u2019s me. \n\nAbout our roleplay: It\u2019s what you want. Like I said, I want to know your craving. Think of me as your roleplay guinea pig. I\u2019m willing to try anything at least once. I have some likes and dislikes, but I haven\u2019t roleplayed in a while, and I\u2019m trying to not fall into the same tropes I used to write over and over. I want something fresh n\u2019 tasty. I want a challenge. I want something that is uncomfortable and rewarding. I want anything at all, at this point. Just hit me with your sweet, sweet ideas and delicious cravings and we will figure it all out. \n\nSome things to note: I am willing to venture into some darker territories, but I have a select few limits that I can share with you in private. Also, I have never done all the fancy face claim stuff that everyone seems jazzed on these days, but I\u2019m willing to give it a try. \n\n\nI have Discord for chatting, and am looking for someone to teach me the ways of Discord roleplay. I usually roleplay primarily over email, but again, my mind is open to the possibilities. \n\nAlso, I would love to entertain your group roleplay pitches. If you have a server that you love, and that would welcome a clueless worm like me, I\u2019d love to talk to you. \n\nSlide into my DMs (PMs? What is it here?) to start the adventure. \n\n\nTL;DR\u2014 I want to talk to you about roleplaying, so talk to me. We\u2019ll figure it out, and hopefully we\u2019ll have a nice time writing together.",

            "selftext": "Hi! I haven't roleplayed for a while, so I'm  little rusty. Dont rub it in. Anyway, like the title says, I'm looking for a group of people who like to fantasy roleplays. The main part of it will take place in the Rimmirene Academy, a school of both the magic and mundane. There is a city too, but we'll get to that later. Anyway, here's the history, I guess.  \n *The city of Drimmirene is a great place of both the magic and mundane. In the center of the city is the Academy of Drimmirene, a school entirely dedicated to helping students practice their magic as well as teach them normal classes. You are a student at this academy. The city itself was made mostly for the students so they wouldn't feel trapped in a single building, though other people from around the country have moved in as well. It has everything a person could need, from blacksmiths and artists, to healers and magic shops. There's even woodlands and large lakes and rivers surrounding the city, so everyone can feel at home.*  \n Theres multiple races to choose from as well as several types of magic, or if you dont want magic, theres always alchemy. Its based heavily off of D&amp;D, but I hope you'll enjoy it none the less. It has a lot of different areas to go and different things to do, so I hope you guys dont get overwhelmed. I would appreciate people who can write more than one or two sentences at a time, though everyone's welcome.

Are there any female writers who are tired of lousy roleplays and are seeking an advanced literate to novella roleplay with multiple characters and multifaceted plot and character development? \n\nHere is what I seek and offer\n\nMultiple characters - 7 to 10 in the story, 3 to 4 each turn.\n\nMulti-paragraphs\n\nPlease be open to discussing and building a plot together. I hope you are open to explore multifaceted developments of each character. A multifaceted plot entails multiple subplots running concurrently, developing and culminating in an overarching story that ties in all subplots and characters.\n\nI want it to be a collective endeavor and would not want to be the sole factor driving the story.\n\nI am open for NSFW themes. Feel free to let me know if that is what you seek.\n\nI am also open to some potential fandom roleplays (canon). Listed below are the fandoms I am open to create a story with.\n\nArrowverse (Arrow, Flash, Legends of Tomorrow)\n\n\nCriminal Minds\n\n\nHawaii Five-0 (Reboot version)\n\n\nNCIS\n\n\nNCIS Los Angeles\n\n\nNikita\n\n\nAgents of Shield\n\n\nHouse of Cards\n\nOriginal stories entirely unrelated to any tv shows are also equally appreciated!

I use kik, discord, or reddit for my roleplay. As for what I\u2019m looking for, I\u2019m not clear on what I\u2019m looking for plot-wise, but I can tell you this: \n\nI love romance, and it\u2019s a definite must, whether it\u2019s FxF or MxF, and I always play female. I\u2019m into drama, action, dark themes, supernatural, slice of life, horror, adventure, and pretty much all of the above. My imagination has troubles when it comes to fantasy and magic, though. \n\nSome loose ideas I\u2019d like to try out currently are:\nMafia/gang.\nFBI,\nEspionage,\nSports related, \nEtc \n\nSome fandoms:\nThe 100,\nPeaky Blinders,\nThe Vampire Diaries, \nSupernatural, \nQuantico,\nThe Society,\nAnd maybe a few more \n\nThose are just a few, but I\u2019m welcome to any ideas or plots you may have. \n\nLet me also mention this: I\u2019m not looking for a sex-based roleplay, but enjoy including it into the story as it fits, with an appropriate build. \n\nMy preference for style is 1st person, but I can do 3rd as well. I don\u2019t care about post length, and think a paragraph is just fine. I cannot find 2+ paragraphs fun, as I feel like it hinders the partners\u2019 abilities to move the story along. Although, when starting a new roleplay I can definitely see where length is necessary. It\u2019s just easier to bounce off of replies when they\u2019re shorter, especially with dialogue. \n\nIf you have any prompts, plots, or ideas you\u2019d like to discuss or roleplay, send me a message so we can get to creating something together. I hope you took time to read this, I tried to keep it short, so if you have any further comments/questions, message me! Thanks, Bailey.",

            "selftext": " \n\nYou had never known your mother. Dad often spoke of her though, that rare dreamy tone in his voice. A 'great and beautiful woman'. The \u2018Most intelligent person he had ever known\u2019 and \u2018as Kindhearted as a saint.\u2019 It was becoming difficult to continue believing that. She had to have been around for your birth of course, but as soon as you turned two she left you, as dad explains, and returned to her homeland far to the West. The Spirit Valley. Otherwise known as Elin Hal. Dad had made her out to be some kind of incredible, all powerful witch who was needed by her clan, she had a great duty to fulfil and leaving the sleepy island town you had spent your entire life on, leaving you, was a small sacrifice in the name of the greater good.\n\nStill, it would be difficult not to resent her. A childhood that had been stripped away before you even knew it. Dad had attempted to raise you on his own. A doctor by trade, a pleasant man, well respected by loyal patients within town. But a doctor has a lot of work and, despite his best attempts, for the most part you were left to your own devices. There wasn't much to do on the island nation of Hanstrasia. It was populous enough not be a wasteland, busy enough so that one could work as any job they wished as long as they were qualified. But nothing seemed to happen. One would go through school, attend college, get a job, find a partner, get married... It was a simple stable uneventful existence. And that was how you always thought it would be.\n\nUntil you received the letter. A request to meet, sent from your mother, who signed the brief document by the name Cecile Vengi. It was the first time you had experienced her actions directly. After much debate and encouragement from dad, who didn't seem to mind Cecile had changed her last name, you decided to rent passage on a merchant airship to the mainland and travel to the Spirit Valley, the famous, but distant, pilgrimage site. The homeland of witches.\n\nAs soon as you left your boring but safe island things started going wrong. The crew who maintained the airship proved to be lazy and uncooperative with you. The 'War of the Lions' between the great democratic Northern Federation and expansionist Southern Empire had spread to the east of the mainland and the fear of winding up in the hands of either nation had petrified the crew. To make matters even worse, you had just been boarded by pirates. Or at least, you thought you had. Rustling and shouting from up on deck and foreign, unfamiliar tongues echoed through the steel corridors of the airship. The vessel itself had slowed, merely floating sluggishly within the sky, a desperate attempt at escape seemingly halted. Out the port hole window you could see a smaller, streamlined black vessel, its float dust vents emitting an ominous violet haze. A triplet of winch harpoons preventing any hope of your merchant ship from breaking away, and even then, it would have been quite impossible to outrun the pirate hunter.\n\nLeft alone in the sky, nothing but the open ocean several thousand feet beneath you, the world seemed totally silent for a brief moment. Then the unmistakable sound of footsteps crept faintly from behind your cabin\u2019s door.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\--\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am looking for a partner to RP with on discord. The RP would revolve around the story of an 18 year old woman in a fantasy world on a journey to meet her mother for the first time. Along the way she would meet many interesting characters, discover much more about the world she inhabits, and solve the mysteries surrounding her mother. To a certain extent this is a coming of a age story, with a young woman leaving her home for the first time, discovering what kind of person she is and what kind of person she might become. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis roleplay does not take place in a conventional fantasy setting. Technology is more akin to 1940/50s. There are no sentient species aside from Humans. People who can cast magic are not conventional 'wizards' from something like harry potter or DnD, as is the magic used in the world. What's more, the Roleplay will include dark topics and themes as the story progresses, so id like my partners to be over 18 for my own peace of mind. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I take a GM style of roleplaying, taking control of setting and most characters, providing a story which ultimately your character stars in. This allows you to experience the plot, meet new characters and learn about them as your own character does. It means I can continually surprise you with twists and offer fun clues as well as foreshadowing to ongoing mysteries. I will never speak for your character or describe their action. All that is on you. Its your character. I understand that this style is not for everyone, as there are some who enjoy plotting stories out beforehand, so no hard feelings if you aren\u2019t so keen. I would also ask that you write in past tense. I don't really have a preference on first person or third person, but we'll talk briefly about what you choose regardless. I will always write in third person.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am not a smut writer and am not interested in writing graphic smut scenes, but I am borderline insistent on including some kind of romance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI normally write two or three paragraphs a response and can ordinarily make one response a day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe shall discuss your character and how the roleplay is going to work over discord. If you have any questions please  ask in the comments so others might be able to read them and see my answers. Please include a writing sample if you choose to message me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI eagerly await to hear from you.",

I\u2019m currently looking for a roleplay that would be either focused on a lesbian romance(nsfw would be fine but not the focus) that could be with characters from a fandom or just our own. Please note that while I don\u2019t care what gender you are irl, for this one your character would need to be a female.\n\n If you don\u2019t want romance then I\u2019d also love to get a roleplay similar to dungeons and dragons with you DMing but it\u2019d be a lot more focused on the roleplay rather than dice and numbers(unless you\u2019d prefer that). \n\nBoth of my ideas can have nsfw elements and it\u2019s up to you if it\u2019s included or not! I\u2019d also love to hear any ideas that you might have! And feel free to check my profile for others, though know that almost all of them are nsfw and that is the main focus of them. \n\nI\u2019m good with roleplaying via kik, discord, or reddit chat! Please let me know which you\u2019d like to use in your first message!",

I love a good power struggle between our characters as yours attempts to tame mine into obedience, either by charm and romance or by force....maybe even a combination of the two if you're into that \ud83d\ude0f\n\nA little about me, I'm a 26 year old female from the states. I've been roleplaying on and off for about 10 years. I'm comfortable with adult themes, though I don't think they should be the sole focus of the plot. I work full time so I reply whenever I can, but there are times when I'll be away. Discord is my preferred platform for roleplaying. \n\nI'm open to any ideas you'd like to send my way! Tell me a little about yourself, your limits and preferences and anything else you'd like to share. I look forward to hearing from you!",

In a nutshell, I'm a veteran of the Yahoo/AIM days of roleplaying. My published work spans a wide range of genres, but recently, I've been feeling a pull back into the world of collaborative writing. There's just something tantalizing about being able to explore unique worlds and scenarios with other like-minded individuals. I currently work in a publishing role at a major publishing house, so I'm eager to write and communicate with others who share a similar passion for creating, reading, and producing original content.\n\n**Genres:**\n\nI'm drawn to stories that take an in-depth exploration into character development and character plot arcs. There's something deeply satisfying about following a character's emotional development as a result of interactions with other characters, and/or environmental changes. I'm also drawn to protagonists who challenge the status quo, or that follow unconventional narrative arcs. This can function in a variety of settings, but contemporary fiction, and historical fiction are some of my favorites for this particular approach.\n\n**Basics:**\n\nI'm 29, and gainfully employed. Hopefully you're also someone who understands what it means to balance the \"real world\" with collaborative fiction. I've been roleplaying for several years now (albeit, excluding my recent break), so I'm familiar with expectations for discussion, collaboration, and literary prose.\n\n**Send Me a Message If:**\n\n* You are over 21.\n* You are an advanced/literate writer who enjoys emotional development in characters.\n* You enjoy collaborative mapping of plot arcs.\n* You enjoy the idea of composing a long-term story.",

            "selftext": "I'm an advanced/literate writer who is  looking for a collaborative partner to compose a long-term, emotionally driven story, with an emphasis on character development and narrative plot arcs.\n\n**About Me:**\n\nI'm a published creative fiction author, primarily in the realm of historical and contemporary fiction. In a nutshell, I'm a veteran of the Yahoo/AIM days of roleplaying. My published work spans a wide range of genres, but recently, I've been feeling a pull back into the world of collaborative writing. There's just something tantalizing about being able to explore unique worlds and scenarios with other like-minded individuals. I currently work in a publishing role at a major publishing house, so I'm eager to write and communicate with others who share a similar passion for creating, reading, and producing original content.\n\n**Genres:**\n\nI'm drawn to stories that take an in-depth exploration into character development and character plot arcs. There's something deeply satisfying about following a character's emotional development as a result of interactions with other characters, and/or environmental changes. I'm also drawn to protagonists who challenge the status quo, or that follow unconventional narrative arcs. This can function in a variety of settings, but contemporary fiction, and historical fiction are some of my favorites for this particular approach.\n\n**Basics:**\n\nI'm 29, and gainfully employed. Hopefully you're also someone who understands what it means to balance the \"real world\" with collaborative fiction. I've been roleplaying for several years now (albeit, excluding my recent break), so I'm familiar with expectations for discussion, collaboration, and literary prose.\n\n**Send Me a Message If:**\n\n* You are over 21.\n* You are an advanced/literate writer who enjoys emotional development in characters.\n* You enjoy collaborative mapping of plot arcs.\n* You enjoy the idea of composing a long-term story.",

When it comes to containing the mystical, Damian is very much an expert in the field. In his years he's hunted many creatures, banished various specters and solved numerous crimes both mortal and mystical in nature. Mortals of course have very little knowledge of this secret world of witches, sorcerers and warlocks that resides in their own. It is up to individuals like Damian to keep Mortals safe and from witnessing any evidence of magic. Anyone finding themselves with evidence of magic are subsequently delt with in a non lethal manner of course. However, On this certain day,you will find yourself being wrapped in a world you didn't know existed in the first place.\n\nRoleplay regulations:\n\n1. please be creative. \n2.

I have had a few ideas rolling around in the back of my head, and I would love to have someone to RP with!\n\nSo, the boring part:\n\nI RP on Discord, and I am looking for a\u00a0MALE FOR MY FEMALE OC; the ideal partner for me can be of any gender, so long as they are\u00a0ABOVE 18 (this is non-negotiable, I will NOT rp with anyone below this age),\u00a0can respond multiple times a day, is not afraid to voice ideas, suggestions and constructive critique, literate, and is just as invested into the story as I am!\u00a0\n\nOf course, I understand completely when things come up, and I am always very open to talking; I do have plenty of free time right now as I haven't started studying on summer and fall, so I'd like someone who can respond with more or less my same frequency. Obviously, I have no issues if you can only post once a day, for example; just let me know and I'll be totally cool with it!\n\nAnother thing I add, is that the rp will\u00a0not be entirely smut based.\u00a0I do often do NSFW scenes of various natures, but the RP will NOT revolve around sex.\n\nSo, now that we got that out of the way, I'm looking for someone to rp this plot with me:\n\nIn life, my OC is a lounge singer that works in the dark lounge bars of Los Angeles. She makes a rather okay living, enough to pay the bills and afford her a few luxuries here and there. The target of a group's unrequited affections, one night as she walks to her home she was assaulted and left for dead, her blood attracting a creature of the night, a Lestat-esque vampire (your OC). A fan of her singing, he sires her, turning her into his childe. He takes her in, and instructs her on her new life. However, ad our OCs learn about eachother and their new life, into the bowels of the nights of Los Angeles, a darkness blacker than a moonless midnight begins to grow, setting the two at the center of it all.\n\nAs our OCs interact, they begin to fall for eachother. I left it purposely vague so we can sit down and brainstorm a really cool story! As I said, I would love this to be long term, so don't be afraid to discuss any ideas as the rp goes on!\n\nSend me a PM with the phrase \"you are what you are\" so I know you read it, and we can discuss plot, face claims, etc., and trade Discords!",

If you want to roleplay just know that I have a list of plots but also you can come up with yours. I do play only I\u00a0 third person. \n\nThank you all for reading this. Anyone who wants to roleplay just hit me up here or in Pms to get my kik or Discord username. Thank you again! Hope to hear from you all soon!",

There are worlds where The FEV was a success, where The Enclave defeated the fledgling New California Republic and Brotherhood of Steel. There are even worlds where China won The Great War,or ones where The Great War never occurred to begin with having instead cooler heads prevail and humanity having entered a time of peace and prosperity never seen before. However, in one universe or even multiple universes experimentation by a variety of factions in quantum technology has sent ripples across the fabric of time and space pulling several unsuspecting beings from their homes and delivering them to a new, foreign universe. It will be your job to fight for your survival as you support the faction of your choice in this brave new world, because War? Well..War never changes.[/i]\n\n\nOOC: Hello one and all! This is something I came up with on the fly and is the answer to all those \"what if\" questions we have about Fallout. This is an oppurtunity for you to make your own individual head-canons a reality and have them effect the RP in a meaningful way! Did The Enclave crush all who opposed them and reforge a new Pure America? Or did they take a more gentle approach and organized all the sentient races of the wasteland under their banner in one glorious nation? You decide!\nMaybe the BoS unified with The Enclave due to unforeseen events in one universe, or Caeser's Legion defeated the NCR in the Battle of Hoover Dam, or perhaps Mr. House was never able to activate the strip's defences and there is no New Vegas at all!\nWe want  to see it all! So go wild!\nIf you're interested, please PM. This will be the creation of the group and I\u2019ll be setting up a Discord Server for it.\n\nThanks!",

I also find it more fun to play more than one character but that is just me so I don't mind if you just want to stick to one.\n\nNow I do have a life so there will be at times where I will be busy I do tend to keep updates on my situation so that you may know how it is and when I may be free or busy. Last thing though, please at least be 18 or older since I don't exactly like the thought of roleplaying with a minor and am more comfortable with people around my age with that being 20.\n\nIf you're interested or have any questions, just message me and I will send you my discord stuff.",

So, a bit about me first:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I am a mature roleplayer with many years of experience.\n* I am more of an advanced writer, and I write in third person past tense in multi-paragraph form.\n* I live in the EST timezone.\n* I roleplay in Discord, Email, or Google Docs. I do not use Kik.\n* My genre preferences (not in any particular order): Historical, Historical Fantasy, Medieval / Medieval Fantasy especially, Modern, Modern Fantasy, Slice of Life, Paranormal or Supernatural mixed in any of the genres listed. If there is a genre not listed, don\u2019t be shy to ask. I\u2019m laid back and open minded. I might just be interested. I like romance mixed in my rps, especially a slow burn, and there will be mature content, but the main focus will be story.  I welcome action, adventure, comedy, angst and drama in any genre. If you prefer darker themes, I thoroughly enjoy those as well. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat I want in a partner:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Please be over 21.  \n* I do not care what your gender/gender identity is. I\u2019m just looking for someone to play a female in a MxF pairing. \n* Please write in 3rd person, past tense. \n* Please be literate. I don\u2019t mind the occasional grammatical error -- no one is perfect. But I would prefer someone who has a good grasp of the English language. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs far as plot goes, I do have some starter ideas depending on your genre preference, but nothing fleshed out. I like to build the story with my partner, and I welcome any ideas you may have.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you\u2019re interested, please send me a private message with your Discord or preferred way of contact so we can get chatting right away. Hope to hear from you soon! :)",

            "selftext": "Hello all. \n\nMy name is Tom and I\u2019m looking for a female rp partner for an Avengers rp. I have an OC that I want to use, if you play an OC or an existing character is up to you. I\u2019m very easy going about this. I\u2019m also more than happy to play other characters a bit for the sake of the rp and the story. \n\nI write in the third person and in paragraphs, in terms of response length one paragraph is absolutely fine but any longer is a bonus. I also write on discord. Your experience in writing/rp makes no difference to me, so if you\u2019re new then I\u2019ll be happy to help show you the ropes but if you\u2019re more experienced then that\u2019s also cool. I personally have been writing for about a year.  \n\nI\u2019m also down for ooc chat about the story and where to go with it so if there are particular elements or events you want to happen then it\u2019s all fine. \n\nThe presence of romance and NSFW elements in the story is not something I am bothered with so if you want that then we can do it, however if you do want NSFW elements then please be 18+. My OC has a dark origin so it will Be quite explicit about how he came to be. \n\nIf this takes your fancy, if you want to change something, have any questions or have some ideas of your own please PM me and I\u2019ll be happy to discuss and exchange discord\u2019s. \n\nThanks!",

            "selftext": "Hi!\n\nI'm a long-time roleplayer, always on the look-out for new partners, new scenes, and new ideas to explore, as long as they involve gay romance between a manly, rugged man (played by my partner) and a softer, delicate one (played by me).\n\nA roleplay with me will be a creative, detailed slice-of-life experience, with plenty of introductory brainstorming and worldbuilding. I'm mainly oriented towards realistic settings, but can enjoy highly creative themes such as fantasy, sci-fi, dystopian.\n\nYou can find a couple of examples down below:\n\n1. **The jock:** a privileged young man, a senior student who managed to get to the end of his university career studying economics just because he's a jock and the college needs him to play in their football team. This \"white straight male\" privilege would permeate his entire life, even after his graduation, as his frat connections would land him a well paid job as manager. Due to his poor results, the jock is forced to get help from my character, a college tutor and fellow student, someone the frat guy would consider a nerd loser, and what's more, a gay loser, upon finding out about his orientation. Will they somehow grow closer? If so, how will the jock reconcile his unexpected feelings with the fact he has a girlfriend he plans on marrying?\n2. **The bluecollar**: the rugged man, still in his worksuit, is sitting at the counter of a gay bar, during a Friday evening. His wife recently divorced on him, leaving with the kids, yet he still wears his wedding ring. In spite of considering himself straight, he's always felt an attraction towards men he had to suppress, but now it's different. Spurred by the hardships of this unexpected turn in his life, the man decided to come here, and now awkwardly sits, drinking a beer. Imagine the surprise in my character's face when the burly stranger will offer him a drink, explaining he's not really used to picking up gays, asking if he's supposed to approah them like he would a woman.\n\n# A final note\n\nI can share my **Discord** or link us to a **Google Doc**, where we'll be able to have an instant messaging conversation and exchange creative ideas.\n\nI'm fluent in English, but it's worth mentioning that I'm Italian and I'd be glad to roleplay in my native language if an Italian user comes by.\n\nLooking forward to your messages :3\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[*I'm an adult/18+ in real life,*\n\n*I'm looking for a partner who is an adult/18+ in real life,*\n\n*everything discussed is fantasy.*\\]",

I'm a 22yo long time roleplayer/writer (male) that usually GM's for a smaller group, but i'm looking for something more one-on-one and long-term (though i'm not opposed to GM'ing, I actually half expect to). Rather than put my own prompts forward, I want to see what you have and work from there. \n\nI try to get at least one paragraph down, but i'm not going to force myself to make something longer than it has to be; if one sentence will get the point across i'll take that. I understand this isn't the most popular here, but i'll at least hold myself to a standard of at least 20 words. Otherwise, I usually don't go over two or three paragraphs. My schedule is constantly hectic, I usually just jump from one thing to the next (plus i'll be starting uni again towards late August), but I should be able to respond most times of the day (EDT here). I use Discord mostly, but Google Docs would also work out fine. \n\nI'm also open to doing nsfw stuff, but that has to be discussed privately.\n\n**Anyways**, on to the fun stuff: \n\nI'd like to do something original, preferably fantasy and it's derivatives (low, dark, medieval, etc), but I also like sci-fi (space opera?) and cyberpunk settings (as well as the cyberpunk derivatives like steampunk or dieselpunk). Superhero settings are something i'd like to experiment with, and although i've never actually done fandom before, I could try to do DC or Marvel. Settings that are mostly grounded in reality are okay, but full on slice-of-life isn't something i'm interested in. Lastly, alternate history or historic settings are also on the table. I'd also like to do some setting building, if only light, to get an idea of what we're working with instead of going in blind.\n\nIf you have any other ideas, i'm open to hearing them. I look forward to hearing from you!",

I've grown tired of the disrespect, and how mentally ill some people are who are drawn to the hobby (I've had some VERY bad experiences). So, I'm posting here looking for respectful role plays (18+) to create great stories with. I'm looking for a partner that likes to get in the creative process with me. I hope to find a partner to help me rekindle my old love in role play through playing gratifying stories. Specifically, I look for writers (male / female playing male) who write in third person and excel at it. If you can only give me a single paragraph per post, you probably aren't the person for me. Understandably, I'm not an insane elitist either. I don't require a page of writing, but something above minimum effort would be great.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm fine with writing NSFW content, as I am well over the legal age. I simply don't want the dirty stuff to completely take over the story. There is a sweet spot where everyone gets what they want, so let's find it together. I only write over Discord, and I have a pretty regular schedule, so I'll have time to reply several, if not more, times during the day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have a few vague ideas off-hand, though I'm totally open to anything. There aren't any genres in writing that I shy away from.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Scifi-- For various reasons, it has become necessary for my character to escape a planet. With no proper ride, she targets your guy, musically 'torturing' him until he agrees to help her, thus beginning their joint adventures.\n* Modern / Fantasy - A vigilante story--preferably a darker tone here.\n* Harry Potter - I'm dying to have some fun at Hogwarts. After recently watching the second Fantastic Beasts, I find my love for the Harry Potter universe is burning bright once more.\n* Overwatch - It's been a long time want of mine to do a Solider 76 / Mercy story line starting prior to the fall of Overwatch. What little tidbits we've gotten on their pasts just makes me more hungry to fill in the gaps.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf none of these strike your fancy, PM me with your ideas. I hope to find some people I can have a good time with again. For the love of god, please actually read my post before you message me. Thanks!",

This play would take place on KIK.\n\nI would play an incarcerated woman in her 30s named April, and you would play the husband of her best friend Kelly. Everyone would know each other pretty well from life on the outside and the couple would regulary April together. However, due to a minor emergency one day, April would receive a visit by the husband alone. During that visit feelings would be shared and affair would begin.    \n\nThats the basic premise and I'd of course work with you OOC to develop more of the backstory and details. I'm very detail oriented and love creating those details.\n\nAlso, if you somehow feel like you'd like to be the one playing the incarcerated party, I would be into playing the female friend of your characters best friend.",

            "selftext": "To make it quite plain; I\u2019m a sucker for romance. Even more so when the characters start off in positions and situations where they dislike each other for whatever reason, and then grow together over the course of the story. I like slow burn romances \u2013 from the early blushes, to the eventual much more intimate parts. \n\nSome people like prompts, others don\u2019t. In this case, I\u2019ve only written some in case a prompt is what you\u2019re after, and it will (I hope) help to give you an idea of the kind of story I\u2019m looking for too. **This is by no means the extent of what I\u2019m willing to rp \u2013 if you have an idea and you think it fits the theme, just PM me!** The *italicised* character is the one I\u2019d want to play myself. They\u2019re in no particular order, and I\u2019m certain some of these could easily be combined as well, if you wanted. \n\n* Arranged Marriage \u2013 a match neither of us really want, but are being forced into. Or perhaps your character does desire it, and it\u2019s a matter of demonstrating why mine should too. \n* *Prisoner of War* \u2013 defeated, used as leverage, maybe just good old kidnapped; however I got there, whoever you are (soldier, General, maybe even royalty), we\u2019ll have to learn to get along.\n* Assassin x *Mark* \u2013 there are so many different reasons an assassin might hesitate, or be forced to delay. Maybe they want to get closer before going in for the kill, or maybe they realise their preferred method isn\u2019t working, and have to take the time to develop a Plan B.\n* Villain x *Hero* \u2013 a typical superhero and villain scenario; enemies that eventually find common ground and interest in one another. \n* Traditional Rivals \u2013 perhaps more appropriate to a fantasy setting, but think things like vampires x werewolves, demons x angels etc.\n* Career Rivals \u2013 pick a career! Maybe we\u2019re both mages, or business leaders, or have bakeries across the road from one another\u2026 you get the idea.\n* Old Enemies \u2013 something in childhood had us at odds, made us dislike each other so much it carried over into adulthood. \n* Rival Houses \u2013 generations of families that hate each other, and maybe we do too, but there\u2019s an edge to that dislike that\u2019s too hard to ignore. Or perhaps now something\u2019s come up and we are forced to tackle the problem together. \n\n**Setting**\n\nI\u2019m fairly flexible in terms of the setting of the game. I enjoy fantasy, sci fi or historical settings the most, but if you want modern, modern fantasy or even SOL I\u2019m happy to do that. \n\n**About Me**\n\nI\u2019m over 25, female, and very literate. I don\u2019t expect you to match me. I enjoy writing, and sometimes if I\u2019m really into a story I can get carried away and write a lot. Some people seem to get put off by this. I hate ghosting, so I will always do my best not to do that to you. I\u2019d appreciate if you weren\u2019t interested in the rp anymore that you just tell me so instead of disappearing. I always play females; I can play males if they\u2019re side characters, but not my main PC. I don\u2019t mind if you play a M or F character. I prefer to write in 3rd person past tense. Sometimes I get busy, and can only reply once a day. I\u2019ll let you know if I\u2019m going to be away longer. I play over Discord or email. \n\n**About You** \n\nWrite more than 1 line. Write dialogue, contribute to the plot, write feelings, express emotions. Be willing to commit to something long term. If you\u2019ve read this far and you\u2019re still interested, include in your message to me how long the longest RP you ever wrote in was. I don\u2019t mind if you like to chat OOC or not. Be patient. Tell me if you need to go away for a few days or can\u2019t reply for awhile for whatever reason. It\u2019s fine. Life comes first. Don\u2019t be a ghost though, because they suck. \n\n**So\u2026**\n\nIf you\u2019re still interested after reading all of that, send me a DM! Let me know what interests you, and what your initial ideas for a plot might be. **If this post is still up, I\u2019m still looking for partners.** \n\nThanks! X",

He felt pride in hearing people call him the one and only 'Dragonborn'. He felt nerves from the expectations. But finally, he had a chance to prove his strength and nobality.\n\nHe could see it, the monastery standing strongly on the snowy mountain side. Even in the violent snowy blizzard howling around the throat of the world he could see all the history that it bathed in. But why in Oblivion is there a dark elf sitting on the steps?\n\n\nHi everyone!! I've been enjoying Skyrim themed roleplays quite a lot and I had an idea of \"Studying the Dragonborn\" where basically my female mage character has traveled from the college to the Greybeards to study the Dragonborn after he is called upon. \n\nWe can talk about restrictions over Discord, if you require any, and any other story details you'd like. We may not start out at the arrival to the monastery if you have a certain place you'd like to start so don't worry about that. I'm a semi-literate roleplayer and also looking to improve my writing and expand my vocabulary. Also I write in a cross over on a serious and comedic type of writing style, I like to dash in a silly personality in my characters sometimes. I find it quite entertaining to mix a immature character with a mature character; quite the pair. XP\n\nIf you have a male character that fits any Dragonborn personality type feel free to DM me if interested. :)\n\nEdit: Also I won't be adding in any new NPC characters as my female mage character doesn't require any what so ever. You can use your own NPC characters though. \n\nYou're Dragonborn character doesn't have to be a noble warrior; they could be a criminal, simple fisher, hunter, merchant, or anything! Just so long as they are willing to take up arms as Dragonborn.",

            "selftext": "Hello there lovely females of this amazing subreddit, I've almost given up on trying to create an idea so here I am, asking if anyone could help me. I want to build a world with a girl based on Heavy Fantasy.\n\nI'm very open to ideas! But one I've been very interested in is having to do with someone from Earth being transported to another world and trying to survive. I like the fact that the character will have to adapt to whatever this other world is like, the fact that I can more or less write about this person's mental state on this things they'll see, good or bad. It fascinates me.\n\nAnyways, I'm just Interested in doing a fantasy roleplay. Completely from scratch, your idea, or mine. I welcome all! \n\nI write a paragraph or more for like 90% of my posts. But I must admit that some days I just blank out then I get pressured about leaving my partner on blank so I write a smaller piece, but I always return with a larger piece after that.\n\nIf you are interested please Message me with your favorite colour and your Discord Name!",

            "selftext": "I've been craving putting together something original for a while now and nothing has seemed to stick when I approach people. So I'm just going to throw out some of the ideas I have and see if anyone bites. Also, for this RP please be above the age of 18 if you plan on reaching out. \n\n\nBut first...\n\n\n**About Me:**\n*I like to RP on Discord. I just think it's easier to keep track of everything with separate rooms on each server.\n*I prefer to use 3rd person.\n*When writing, I'm happy to write anywhere from a few lines to about two paragraphs. I don't need a huge epic response every time, and I certainly like to keep the plot flowing, but I also like some meat to chew on when I'm reading and writing.\n*While I like creating characters, I don't need a backstory that dates back to before the womb. Its perfectly fine to give me a little bit of a backstory and then lets figure it out along the way.\n*I'm open to play multiple if we want to do some kind of group something. \n*I'd like some NSFW stuff in it, which we can discuss, but I also don't want it to be the center of the RP. I'm looking for adventure and romance with just some fluff and smut to keep it colorful. \n*I like using character references.\n\n\nOkay! I think that's it. Now on to my ideas...\n\n\n\n**West Coast Wild West:** My character is on the run from the law. He took off from somewhere in the middle of the US on horseback and didn't plan to stop till he hit the ocean of the West Coast... that is, until he saw you. Who you are is up to you. Maybe you're a Native American who was abandoned by her tribe, maybe you're a farm girl who couldn't take her boring life anymore and left her home. Or maybe you have an idea? This revolves around us traveling through to the West Coast on horseback. Lots of camping, lots of laying low in small towns, and lots of you trying to figure out why I'm so secretive and why exactly I'm on the run. Maybe you have your own secrets too? \n\n**Up To The Mountain:** My character is an adventuer who loves a good tale. One night in your parents tavern you hear me telling some giant tail about a mysterious artifact lodged into the top of the highest mountain in all the land. Even more ridiculous than the tale is that you hear me say I'm going to go find it. You spend the night thinking about it and as I head out the next morning, you throw away everything you know for the chance at one great adventure. \n\n**For The Band:** We're in a band on the road. Does anyone listen to our music? Well, not a lot. But we'll be big someday. We're on a traveling tour which requires us to go town to town for each show. Lots of road trips, traveling together in a van at night, cheap hotels... and more.\n\n**Lesser Fleshed Out Ideas:** Here are some random ideas that I haven't really thought out. Feel free to choose from them though and lets puts something together! Treasure hunting, Anything to do with College, Theatre Showmance, Sports.\n\nWe don't need to have the plot fully written out before we start, I'm looking to jump in as soon as we can. I'm happy to get some stuff under our belt and then continue to plot as we move on! \n\nIf you're interested, PM me and I'll share my discord name with you. Looking forward to seeing if anyone bites.",

            "selftext": "Hello there! Let's get down to business.\n\nI'm looking for some a fun and interesting MxM roleplay. I guess I may as well lay down some basic information.\n\n***A little about myself***\n\n* I am from the PST timezone\n* I'm pretty active when it comes to posting and will try to do so multiple times a day\n* I absolutely love fantasy. Be it the possible settings, the magic, or just the numerous different creatures that one can play as, I just can't help myself. I'm more than happy to do modern fantasy or even different time periods\n* I really only do MxM ships, so really sorry for those looking for FxM or FxF. This also applies to characters that identify as males since that's a whole separate situation and one that I am not personally willing to get into.\n* I am literate. When replying, my posts can vary in length from anything like one to two paragraphs, upwards of two entire posts on Discord. It really just depends how into the RP I am. \n\nAs a sidenote, I'd like to point out that while romance is always a plus in these sorts of roleplays, it is in no way required. I like having relationships between characters built up over time, not just instant having them go at it. It feels a lot more genuine when these relationships are fleshed out and given meaning instead of just two characters forced to like each other.\n\n***Things I expect from a partner***\n\n* I want someone that is also literate\n* I want someone that can write a good and compelling story, not just leaving all aspects of the plot to me\n* I'd like someone who I can volley posts with, someone who's active and has the time to have fun with these characters\n\nWhen it comes down to it, my wants are pretty basic. I just want someone who I can sit down with and have a good time with both of our characters. I have a plethora of characters, all vastly different from one another. From towering centaurs to ferocious werewolves, or even the charming demon I can play just about anything.\n\nHopefully, we can plan something out and get to know each other a bit better. If interested, feel free to leave a comment or shoot me a message, we can discuss things and exchange discord information there.",

I like to have at least two, because one isn\u2019t enough haha. \n\nI don\u2019t have too many preferences regarding age . As long as you\u2019re not like 13 and under I\u2019ll roleplay with you.\n\nI\u2019m looking for someone who has a moderate literate level at least, and who can do at least one paragraph per response. \n\nI\u2019m super into Fantasy roleplay and Sci Fi. If you have any other ideas I can try it out. I\u2019m open to any ideas, so we can discuss that further in dms . \n\nI prefer OCs...BUT...I don\u2019t mind Canon characters and so on. I just like a ton of creativity to be in roleplays. Your OC doesn\u2019t have to have a lengthy description, I can find out more throughout the story. \n\nI prefer discord as a way to do roleplays. I had Kik, but I only used it once...So I deleted it haha.\n\nThat\u2019s about it! Pm me if you have any interest!",

It's currently very small, but we're hoping the more members to join, the more fun it'll be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast Haven takes place in a medieval fantasy setting. The world is a harsh place, full of crooks and monsters. The nobles are harsh and cruel, while the church heaps all the blame on the demons.

This story is set on a floating city, said to be from the Last Haven. The poor families send their children to this floating city in the hopes of a better life for them, where they will receive an education and learn how to combat the evil monsters and criminals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Feel free to directly message me for a link, and feel free to ask any questions you might have!",

The answers to those questions are: Classified, classified, and we're not in your bedroom. You're here at the Federal Bureau of Paranormal Investigation. We identified you as a good potential agent. Why? Because, quite frankly, if you told your friends and family you were kidnapped by a government agent who tried to induct you into a secret agency, they would laugh it off as another odd quirk. You're just that type. That's what we need.\n\nYou see, the government really has been lying to the sheep for years now. Thing is, the government don't come up with the lies. They're not that smart or that responsible. We feed them the lies to feed everyone else. The truth would quite literally drive them insane.\n\nWe deal with the paranormal. All of it. Aliens, eldritch gods, zombies, vampires, werewolves. Nearly every event in world history was caused by the paranormal, and it's our job to make sure nobody knows that. Your job title, if you choose to accept it, will be SPOOK: Special Occult Operations and Paranormal Kingsman. Yes, Kingsman. We've been around for millennia, but we were formally organized in the Colonial era. We keep certain traditions.\n\nAs a SPOOK, you'll be one of the Men in Black you've heard so much about. There's something big coming, and we need a lot agents than we have right now, which is why we contacted you. We're a bit desperate. Once you hear what we have to say, you will be too.\n\nSo, you have a choice to make. You can take the blue pill, and wake up in your bed, convinced this was all a dream, and continue believing whatever you want to believe. Or you take the red pill, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.\"\n\n____________________________________________________\n\nHi! I'm looking for a partner to continue an RP in this vein. You'll be an agent of the FBPI, and I'll basically be the DM/GM, running everything else as you adventure through the world (and any alternate dimensions). I do para RP, third person, and I want the same from you for the sake of ease. Message me if you're interested, we're going to be doing this on Discord. Thanks!",

            "selftext": " \n\nThis is Eclipse RolePlay, created a few das ago, now has around 30 users, and we\u2019re hoping to grow soon.\n\nIt offers a realistic sci fi RP experience. You can create your character as you wish and want, and also your own ship. You can even create your own gang, faction, corporation or even superpower. It features the whole solar system controlled and shaped by the players, and maybe in the future (as the story continues) other solar systems. The server has now left its initial development stage so RP is open, in an Alpha stage.\n\n\\`\\`\\`A summary of the Lore\\`\\`\\`\n\nIt's the year 2610, and the human race has colonized all of the solar system. Technological advancement still doesn't grant us travel to system and system in no time, but it grants us travel within the system. The two major controlling superpowers are the UE Federation, and mostly the Martian Empire. Also the system is kept in order by a private faction of security that goes on from 2193, named Galactic Patrol. There are major weapon producers, counting stations on Mercury and Venus, but also an independent one on Pluto, the Plutonian Shipyard. Also a private corporation named Heavy Defense, producing high tech weaponry and ships. Gangs and factions rule the planets of Neptune and Uranus, making Pluto a harder place to reach, because of raiders along the way. Earth and Mars still remain the two most important planets of the system, as they are home to the two major superpowers.\n\nAlso, in the lore the Martian Empire, the Heavy Defense corporation, and the Galactic Patrol are player controlled.\n\n\\`\\`\\`The server offers\\`\\`\\`\n\n1. Roleplay in a lot of different channels and places around the solar system.\n\n2. The possibility to create your own Character, Spaceship, Gang, Faction, Corporation or even an entire Political Superpower. (to rp you need to submit at least a character, in a google form)\n\n3. The server has a variety of Races to choose from, based on humans that have changed through the years to adapt, for example, to planet Mars.\n\n4. A verification System to not allow bots all over the server.\n\n5. A website with all the information on the lore, and a list of the player characters and ships!\n\n6. A great staff (but small) to help and resolve any problems, and add your character to the website.\n\n7. A google form for people who want to apply to be staff members!\n\n8. A great community who will welcome you! (sadly many users aren\u2019t very active, but we hope to bring more active ones.)\n\n9. Custom roles! Just ask an Admin or Owner!\n\n\\`\\`\\`Invite links!\\`\\`\\`\n\n[https://discord.gg/m4BgbpM](https://discord.gg/m4BgbpM)\n\nWe hope to see new players!",

I apologize for any annoyance I have caused, haha!\n\nMy last posts I have been looking for partners for 3rd person, long responses, and all that shabang. Well now I\u2019ve been wanting to role playing with someone that can do a role play where we don\u2019t have to be so serious. \n\nSometimes it can be draining responding with long responses, detailing the scenes and all that. I\u2019m looking for one person where we can do a simple role play in either 1st or 3rd person where the replies are a few sentences or a paragraph long. These usually result in people staying and more faster paced role plays. Yes it\u2019s nice to know he curtain color, but let\u2019s speed it along please! Long posts are good, don\u2019t get me wrong, but sometimes I want things to go a bit faster. \n\nI like to chat so being friends and chatting daily is a must! Multiple replies a day is also a must. \n\nA little info about me. I reside in California and in the PST time zone. I know some people don\u2019t really care about time zone, but I would recommend being somewhere close to mine. Not required, however! \n\nI enjoy talking to people and work where I\u2019m able to be on my phone often so I can reply multiple times a day. \n\nNow anyways! I have a few ideas on what role plays we can do but I\u2019m always open to ideas. \n\n1). Office romance. One of our characters is a new worker and the other takes a liking to them. Something like this and of course we can discuss more details if we select this one! Haven\u2019t done this one yet and this one seems fine. Coworker/coworker or boss/secretary.\n\n2). The pregnant friend. Your character recently discovered she\u2019s pregnant. The boyfriend dips. My character could be out somewhere and they meet and end up talking more. Few dates in she tells him she\u2019s pregnant. Will he stay? Will there be drama? \n\n3). Your idea. I\u2019m always open to ideas as I\u2019m down for anything. Except historical types and fandom ones. \n\n*Feel free to contact me for my Discord since I only use discord for role playing.* Thank you for reading and I hope to hear from you soon. \n\n~Josh",

Now before any of you click away as you don\u2019t know a thing about Bleach, please don\u2019t. This roleplay does not require any knowledge on the series as I will fill in your gaps of knowledge. Of course being a fan of the series is a big plus. \n\n(If you\u2019d like to read up on the series I\u2019ll leave a link to the wiki here: https://bleach.fandom.com/wiki/Bleach_Wiki) \n\nNow onto the meat of the prompt, in the roleplay we would playing in an alternative universe then the one of Bleach. This means that none of the characters exist or plot points have happened, allowing for much more creative freedom on our side. I imagine the roleplay would detail our characters\u2019 lives and adventures, these would be discussed in more detail after we have made our characters.\n\nNow then a little about me, I\u2019ve been roleplaying for 5 years now and enjoy to roleplay in 3rd person, past tense and I\u2019m more then capable of doing multiple paragraphs for a roleplay.\n\nNow what do I expect from you? Well not too much actually, all I ask is you be enthusiastic and for your post length, just give me something to work with, that\u2019s all. \n\nI hope to have tickled your fancy today, so please just send me a message, I\u2019m friendly and don\u2019t bite :)",

            "selftext": "Hey, my name is Gallows, and I'm looking for some fandom roleplays! Just some odds and ends. A bit about me: I'm over twenty, I've been doing collaborative writing for well over twelve years, and I really, *really* like hyenas!\n\nNow, without further adieu... Let's get down to business!\n\n**SFW/NSFW?**  \nWhatever you like. I always throw in a bit of NSFW content unless instructed otherwise at the beginning of a roleplay. Please speak up if you don\u2019t want that sort of stuff! \n\n**LIMITS?**  \nI don\u2019t have any limits. Like... none. I'm disgusting. Please tell me your limits, though! (Also, I *am* an adult, so please don't attempt to write with me if you are a minor!)\n\n**STYLE?**  \nThird person. Paragraph format. Typically two to three paragraphs long (\\~300 words) if the preferred length is unspecified by my partner. I\u2019m really adaptable - always happy to write more - so I\u2019ll tend to mirror you if you go longer.\n\n**looking for \u2026 ?**\n\n* **KUROSHITSUJI:**\u00a0Primarily seeking\u00a0**Alois/Claude** or\u00a0**Alois/Ciel**. I will literally worship the ground you walk on if you contact me about these pairings. And, yes, I\u2019m willing to play Claude (I love to play Claude). If you\u2019re interested in another pairing, there\u2019s no harm in asking! I play **Sebastian/Ciel** too!\n* **(TAZ) BALANCE:** Alright, so this is pretty much a free-for-all. **Lup/Barry**, **Taako/Kravitz**, **Kravitz/Taako/Magnus**, **Lucretia/Lup**, **Edward+Lydia**, **Edward+Lydia/Lup+Taako**. I like to play as Kravitz, Lup, and Edward+Lydia.\n* **DRAMATICAL MURDER:**\u00a0I will play anyone and anything. I prefer pairings like **ViTriAo**, **NoiAo**, and **RenAo**. ~~I will cut off my own arm for a ViTriAo roleplay.~~\n\nMoving along!\n\n**RULES**\n\n* I don\u2019t double. \n* I will play multiple characters if the need arises, but I will not play multiple main relationships in the same thread. I\u2019m very much accustom to the old style of roleplaying, and stubbornly set in my ways. If we get comfortable writing with one another, I'm more than down to have separate threads! \n* I will not tolerate godmodding. Do not unreasonably overpower your character, and do not control my character(s) unless that is within your character's capabilities.\n* Alternate universes are alright, but I'm not too great at plotting them! I'd rather that you have an idea prepared.\n* I\u2019m not here to police your grammar \u2013 I\u2019m here to have a fun time, just like you! I only ask that you make your statements clear enough for me to understand.\n\n...And that's about it! I prefer to roleplay on Discord, but email and kik are acceptable mediums as well! If you're interested in anything you see here, just leave a comment down below and I'll PM you with my details. Thanks!",

I\u2019ve been wanting to get back into the swing of things after taking a small hiatus!\n\nI am looking for a literate writing partner with particular interests in the crime/thriller/action genre \u2013 because this time there is a specific plot in my mind that I wish to roleplay!\n\nI should mention I\u2019m looking for a partner over the age of 18,  I\u2019m just not comfortable roleplaying with anyone younger. Also, I\u2019m looking for good writers who have great depth and detail in their posts. As for lengths of posts, my own varies from 3 - 8 paragraphs -to more, so generally 2000 or so words!\n\nI should also mention that I work full time so if you\u2019re looking for someone who can post multiple times to once a day, I am unfortunately not your girl. I like to seriously write at least once or twice or even three times a week but if my partner can at least send a nice well-written post twice or three times a month that is ok \u2013 it absolutely works just fine with me if you can\u2019t post weekly! I\u2019m patient and I\u2019m hoping to find someone like that too. I\u2019d like this to be a long-term thing!\n\nI also need to go over some things that could be big deal breakers for a many of you who might be reading this:\n\n* The plot doesn\u2019t contain romantic elements or smut.\n* You can play side characters but I\u2019d like you to play a male main character.\n* I only write over email!\n\nIf that\u2019s all ok with you so far, great, read on!\n\nThe plot I came up with still needs improvement and your contribution! I\u2019m really hoping to find someone who is not afraid to share his own ideas, what he truly wants in the story. I don\u2019t want this to be a one sided thing and be left to carry this whole story by myself! \n\nIf you\u2019re interested, don\u2019t hesitate to PM me and don\u2019t forget to tell me about yourself!\n\nCan\u2019t wait to hear from you!",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone!\n\nI'm looking for a roleplay partner, preferably long-term. I'd say I'm an intermediate writer, so I'm looking for someone to match that, or even an advanced writer. \n\nI like to role-play lots of different genres, my personal favorites being romance, fantasy/supernatural, psychological and dark/horror. Another theme I don't typically have any problems with is omegaverse, which is an AU. \n\nI typically write and expect at least 6 or more lines, just give me something to work with and in return I'll give you something to work with as I understand sometimes there can be very little to write about, hence very little lines.\n\nI also roleplay in third person, and I'd appreciate if you did so as well. Be sure to have good grammar and punctuation, too.\n\nIf you're interested, please don't hesitate to comment, or inbox me! Much love",

I'm 30y/o roleplaying veteran, and I've been rping since I was 15 or so- first on Neopets, and then on various internet forums and internet mediums. Maybe you knew me, even. Maybe not.\n\nI've been away from this sort of thing for a while, but now I'm back, and looking to maybe give this whole thing a go again! I usually write in first person past tense (I looked at her, she looked at me, etc) but I can stretch to third person or present tense if I absolutely need to.\n\nI consider myself 'literate', and can write several paragraphs per post or reply or whatever; I prefer to keep things at 3-5 per pop, so events can keep moving swiftly, and we don't get bogged down in unnecessary filler details that do nothing whatsoever to drive the plot along.\n\nI'm willing to give most genres a go, but I prefer slice of life stuff, modern day fantasy, medieval fantasy, Victorian fantasy, science fiction (see a pattern here?), pretty much any kind of fantasy. Low or high doesn't matter, but I prefer things to be in some way not the norm at all, even if it might seem normal for the characters.\n\nSpeaking of, I prefer to play my own gender, but I can play female if it's necessary to the plot. I prefer to focus on two characters, bringing in others when needed, but I'm open to other alternative ideas too.\n\nI prefer the slow-burn romantic kinds of plots, with lots of character development, gratuitous adorableness, and lashings of angst and emotional turmoil. I'm not a huge fan of gore for gore's sake, but if it makes sense in context, I'm all for it.\n\nI have a few ideas floating round, and some more in my head that haven't yet been written anywhere. At the moment, I've got a few everyday ideas, a couple or three involving people with superpowers, a couple of Fantasy things, and some miscellaneous stuff, too.\n\nI'm around most of the time, and can reply pretty regularly, and will often match whatever I'm given in terms of quality, length, etc.\n\nI prefer to use Discord or something similar, but if you're only able - or willing- to use Reddit PMs or emails, then I can work with that too. Please don't send me messages on Reddit chat- I don't use it, and I will totally miss your messages.\n\nI look forward to hearing from whomsoever this might interest!",

This year, my project is called Realms, a fantasy roleplaying group set in the massive Boreal forest of Canada. Running a group roleplay takes a lot of creative writing, coordination and collaboration, and I'm looking for passionate and expressive writers to roleplay with.\n\nThe Boreal forests contain several realms, each with their own magical and supernatural creatures, from shape-shifting wolves to mystical ice faeries. The plot will explore modern conflicts between the various groups, which have coexisted for thousands of years, as well as the histories and the alliances between them. \n\nIf you're up for a bit of fantasy, or have any ideas to help flesh out the roleplay's plot, feel free to drop a comment below, or message me. Anyone you can bring is welcome too!",

I am hoping for someone who realizes that I do have a life outside of this, and I will do my best to reply as often as possible but this is just a hobby for me and something I want to *enjoy.*  \n\n\nHere are some other little blurbs before I go into my interests:  \n\n\n* 18+ NSFW - It's not a must! However, if it is included in our writing, I would prefer it does not dominate the entire plot.   \n\n* I am SEMI LIT/LIT, I can write in both paragraph or script form, it doesn't bother me either way as long as you give me something good to reply to. I am a quality over quantity, I don't want to stress myself out trying to write 8+ paragraphs when it is not necessary.  \n\n* I am really hoping to find someone that I click with! It would be really nice to develop a friendship, I don't enjoy it as much when it's all business.    \n\n* \"Doubles\" is **mandatory** when it comes to romance/pairings, if I am playing your love interest, you would be playing mine.   \n\n\n**INTERESTS:** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* ORIGINAL PLOTS  - This is where we can discuss about what we are both interested in! Fantasy, adventure, horror, mystery, we can talk about it! \n* My Hero Academia  \n\n* Game of Thrones\n* D. Gray Man\n* Full Metal Alchemist  \n\n* Final Fantasy VII/X \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have many others but those are what I can think of currently!  \n\n\nSo, if you're friendly and looking for a new partner, let's give it a shot!

I'm 23 M and from the UK, but I stay up pretty late. Anyway that's enough about me really, onto the idea. Or rather... ideas.\n\nThe first is that we're both high school students, i'm new to the school and as a result, kind of a loner, a bit of an unknown to everyone that's been there for a while. You on the other hand, well who you are is up to you! But I was thinking we'd be forced together to work on something. Like you being a dancer and I a pianist, or just being put together in a class for a project. You get the idea.\n\nThe second is something a bit older; we're in our early 20's and one of us is going through a bad breakup. We've known each other since we were little kids but never went beyond being close friends, naturally we comfort each other and things start to develop beyond that.\n\nSo, yeah that's it. I know they aren't the most original ideas and honestly i'm not expecting too many responses to this, but hey you don't know until you try right? :)\n\nI tend to write 1-3 paragraphs per response, and I can happily do first or third person, that's up to you. I'm not an elitist about how you type or how much you type or anything like that, but effort is appreciated of course. I am also open to other ideas you might have! The only rule I have is you being 18+ considering, well, i'm not all that comfortable with RPing with someone below that. Sorry!",

            "selftext": "The Dragon Harvest Festival, a time to thank the gods for a bountiful harvest. You sat upon your seat amongst the other members of *The Council*, a group of nobles who ran the town Tsal. You looked over the large party in the square, watching as people danced and drank away their troubles. The council talked amongst themselves, deciding what to do in the coming year to prepare for the coming war. \n\nFor years province of Esrouc had been harassing your province of Enod. Tensions were always stiff, with very little going between the groups but now war was at the doorstep, banging on it with iron fist. The general of Esrouc was a cruel man from what you heard, commanding an army that more than tripled your own. You were afraid, like all the other nobles. A few had suggested increasing the size of the army, drafting the capable young men but it was denied as your army would still be too small. \n\nListening back in on the conversation, you heard the new plan that was seemingly getting more positivity. \n\u201cIf we leave in one week we\u2019ll have enough time to gather our supplies and pull out from this city. One of the other provinces will take us in, even if they refuse they will not be able to refuse our gifts!\u201d Said one of the older nobles, Desme. The others were nodding in agreement, seemingly alright with leaving an entire town of innocents to fend of an army. Standing up, you announced you were retiring to your quarters for an early night. Going back inside, you collapsed onto your bed, thinking of how you were going to stop this bloodshed from happening. \n\nYou awoke suddenly, the sound of screaming breaking the silence of your room. You sat up quickly, the entire room dark save for some moonlight peeking through the crack in your door. But soon that too was blocked by a figure. The door opened slowly to reveal what looked like a young woman, her lower face covered by a mask. A sword hung in her right hand, blood dripping from its blade. Footsteps of guards stomped on the lower levels, running to try and get up to the floors. The woman didn\u2019t seem worried, moving across the floor slowly towards you, her blue eyes seeming to shine in the darkness. The blade was brought up to your chest, the woman\u2019s palm pressing against the base of the hilt gently. But it was enough for you to feel the sting of metal cutting skin. You looked into the woman\u2019s eyes, cold and calculating. \n\n\u201cThe others have already died, do not resist and I shall grant you a swift death coward.\u201d She said, her voice as light as the shining moon, seeming to be the wind speaking within your ear.",

The town's economy comes from two main businesses, tourism and fishing, but Seaport has a secret, third, income stream that very few of the residents actually know about. Under the fa\u00e7ade of the quaint port-town with nice beaches is the hub for magical activity on the East Coast. Sure there's magic all over the place, but Seaport is one of the most concentrated amount of magic this side of the states. Magic thrives in the seclusion of the small town and the magical residents always try to keep it that way, never giving away too much to the non-magical residents. Underport is the name of the magical districts of the town. It is made up mostly of small pocket dimensions with entrances and exits all over the town.\n\n[https://discord.gg/KcnnfeW](https://discord.gg/KcnnfeW)",

In a nutshell, I'm a veteran of the Yahoo/AIM days of roleplaying! My published work spans a wide range of genres, but recently, I've been feeling a pull back into the world of collaborative writing. There's just something tantalizing about being able to explore unique worlds and scenarios with other like-minded individuals. I currently work in a publishing role at a major publishing house, so I'm eager to write and communicate with others who share a similar passion for creating, reading, and producing original content. \n\n**Genres:**\n\nI'm drawn to stories that take an in-depth exploration into character development and character plot arcs. There's something deeply satisfying about following a character's emotional development as a result of interactions with other characters, and/or environmental changes. I'm also drawn to protagonists who challenge the status quo, or that follow unconventional narrative arcs. This can function in a variety of settings, but contemporary fiction, and historical fiction are some of my favorites for this particular approach.\n\n**Basics:**\n\nI'm 29, and gainfully employed. Hopefully you're also someone who understands what it means to balance the \"real world\" with collaborative fiction. I've been roleplaying for several years now (albeit, excluding my recent break), so I'm familiar with expectations for discussion, collaboration, and literary prose. \n\n**Send Me a Message If:**\n\n* You are over 21. \n* You are an advanced/literate writer who enjoys emotional development in characters.\n* You enjoy collaborative mapping of plot arcs.\n* You enjoy the idea of composing a long-term story.\n\nIf any of this strikes your fancy, send me a message, and we can take the conversation to Discord, Hangouts, or Skype. I hope to hear from you soon!",

Instead, I will be playing F!Hawke and will ship with either Varric or your Inquisitor OC. This roleplay will start when Hawke meets with the Inquisitor in Skyhold, and it will follow the story of the game from there. I would prefer to work out the details in PMs or on Discord, so shoot me a message if you are interested. Also, make sure to read my rules:\n\n1. Please be literate. I usually write at least 2 meaty paragraphs, usually more, and I would like a partner who can do the same. Not only that, the better the grammar and detail, the more I want to continue.\n2. Romance is a huge plus for me.\n3. If you do go with a canon character, please try to play them accurately. \n4. I tend to try to become friends with my RP partners; I hope that is alright.\n5. Please be patient with me, as I am often busy.\n6. I am fine with adult topics, just run it by me first.\u00a0",

I enjoy roleplaying a variety of prompts but my favorites include: romance, fantasy, and sci-fi. I usually do a combination of more than one though. \n\nIf you also want a friend (to talk out of rp) I am completely okay with that as well. I am shy at first however, and I understand many would prefer someone who is extroverted. \n\nSome rules I have include: \n\n* 3 sentence minimum for responses\n* Third person\n* A response daily\n\nIf you are interested, PM me so we can exchange discord information and talk further about prompts, characters, etc.",

Instead, an intimate venture between two (or more, though I prefer 1x1) characters where narrative drives the story rather than dice rolls. I love magic and elves and dragons, but I love grounding them with realism and political intrigue even more.\n\nA little bit about me: My name is Violet, I have been rping for a decade now, and my life can get pretty busy. I am looking for partners who know their way around some grammar checking, write in third person, and comfortable with 1-5 paragraphs per reply. I understand real life takes precedence over rp. If you need breaks, just keep me informed, and please grant me the same respect.\u00a0\n\nI will only accept partners who are 18+.
