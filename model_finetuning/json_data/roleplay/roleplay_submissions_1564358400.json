I\u2019m 26, male, in Seattle, looking for a new partner to RP with!\n\nI\u2019m looking to play a romance, with a good splash of drama, and am very open to going for a different theme to make it not like every other roleplay theme out there. I love the brainstorming and world building process and would prefer a detailed and literate partner. Oh and I only RP on discord. \n\nIn terms of my title \u2014 I\u2019ve just noticed over the years that if I\u2019m not able to joke, talk, get excited about the roleplay and discuss life with my RP partner it just doesn\u2019t have the longevity that we all are looking for. With that in mind, I\u2019m looking for someone who embraces OOC, and understands that  the relationship is integral to the RP. I would like to first become friends and then start the RP if that\u2019s okay.\n\nA little about me: I\u2019m a mental health counselor/therapist, enjoy running and reading a good amount, and my job can be stressful, and need the escape that RP gives. I love laughing (not sure who doesn\u2019t though) and love writing as well!\n\nSend me a message with a little about you and your discord and we can go from there!",

The entire thing has me at odds with myself, who I am, what I'm doing, etc. and it would really clear things up. On top of that, I miss you. There. I said it. Wrote it. I bloody miss you. I just...

I know you like to come here, so I thought I'd leave you this message in the hopes that you see it (I made an account and everything).

            "selftext": "Six months ago, the unthinkable happened; at a summit intended to broker the first real, lasting truce between the superheroes and supervillains of the world, everyone attending disappeared. All that were left were the scraps, the remnants, the ones that were left; the weak, the rookies, the old, the retired, the injured, and the cripplingly-specialised.\n\nIn other words, you. \n\nOne month ago, letters and emails appeared in mailboxes and inboxes, inviting you- yes, you- to become part of a new Hero initiative. The world needs hope, you were told; the world has villains and criminals that still need to be stopped; the world needs you. You were told to report to Worthing Academy For Troubled Youths- secretly the pre-eminent school for the gifted- where the Headmaster, the Faceripper, renowned ex-hero and mentor to the elite would welcome you.\n\nToday, you meet at the academy for the first day of the rest of your lives. Welcome, heroes. Welcome, all.\n\nWhatever Happened To All The Heroes? is a literate, group roleplay based around the incoming class to the Worthing Academy, and their adventures and misadventures. We're a friendly group who like to kick back and chat as much as we like to get some serious roleplaying done. With plenty of experience of both group and individual roleplays, you'll find an environment of people who love to write, and who love to write well, and who love to tell a story.\n \n**A few ground rules:**\n All characters are weak. That's just the way of the universe. There's no Supermen here, no Batmen or Wonder Women or Captain Americas. At best, you'll be a retired hero who was sidelined for being old; at worst, you're a rookie with no control, no experience, and no respect.\n\nPlease be 'literate'. That means at least a couple of plot-advancing paragraphs per post. Loners and passive-aggressive corner-sitters will need to put in extra effort to be involved; you'll have to come us, we won't come to you.\n\nPlease be active; taking a few days out here and there is fine, but if you're going to be inactive for long periods of time, please let someone know.\n\nHave fun!: We're all fans of superheroes, and if you're not having fun, what's the point, right?\n\nAll characters must be of legal age; college age at the youngest. For liability reasons, the school is unable to accept students under the age of 18, even if they 'look over 18', or 'are secretly a 100 years old'. \n\nOkay, so feel free to PM me with questions and stuff. If you're looking to join, put your favourite superhero- or villain- in the title, and answer me these questions three:\nHow much experience do you have?\nIf you had any superpower, what would it be, and would you use it for good, evil, or personal gain?\nIt's not a question, but a quick one-paragraph writing sample would be great.\n\nSee you there soon, hopefully!",

Anyway, i'm 23F from the UK, and i'm looking for someone who would perhaps be interested in an RP involving romance, magic, and adventure! \n\nThe idea isn't too complicated, in fact, it's quite simple; \n\nYou're a commoner and I'm a noble, we're both gifted in magic and about equal in strength, and we both study together. Over our time together we've developed a sort of rivalry, with a hint of admiration from both sides but generally we act as if we can't stand each other, even if that's untrue. \n\nOn the contrary, I love you. I'd never admit it - not even to myself - but I go above and beyond for you consistently, helping you with your problems, dealing with people that have issues with you, sneaking you money when I know you or your family are tight on it. But all the while i've convinced myself it's purely out of respect, and the fact I need a rival to work off of.\n\nIt's the final day of a tournament held in our duelling class, and we two are the finalists, facing off against each other... perhaps for the last time, not that you know that at the time. The day after is a celebration of the winner, and a dance, but regardless of the result the day before, it's clear that i'm not okay. Perhaps it has something to do with the war that's looming...\n\nThat's it! Hopefully this interests somebody! I'm not really expecting it to but you don't know until you try right? I do tend to include NSFW elements into RP's if it fits our characters, so do try and keep that in mind!\n\nI play on discord but can happily discuss here first.",

I thought by creating and designing cute OCs but barely enough to design what they\u2019d be like, personality wise. \nThat\u2019s why Roleplaying comes into play. I want to share my characters with others. To help me be creative and breathe life into my characters. \n\nIt sounds silly I know, but I thought it would be a good idea to put an ad here. To find someone with a like mind, and creativity to get together. \n\nI\u2019m alright with NSFW themes, just not the too weird things of that side. Call me old fashion. \nAs for themes in general. I like supernatural themes, Slice of life, high fantasy( like DND), or horror.\nPairing wise: I can do M/F, F/F, and M/M. I have so many characters to fit any fancy you may like. \nI can not RP as canon characters, I don\u2019t watch a lot of anime/Tv shows and just makes me uncomfortable. \n\nAs to what I expect from my partners... well I'm not asking for much just to follow the basic rules of etiquette:\n\nWhen I ask you what type of RP me you would like to do. Dont just go:\n 'idk.' \nWell then why did you seek me out in the first place?? At least have a basic idea of what youd want and we can bounce ideas back and forth. \n\nI'm immediately going to be turned off if you want nothing but Smut. My characters are like my own kids and they're not for you to satisfy an 'itch'. At least let there be some kind of plot and development between our characters. \n\nTell me what you're comfortable doing. That way I have a better understanding what kind of character I'll be playing as.\n\nOh and one last thing... I dont do furries. Nothing against them but not my thing. I have half/human ocs /cat and bunny girls, etc/ \n\nSorry for the rules. I've been doing this song and dance for so long, and I've seen so many people disregard my comfort and lost interest. So if you've read the rules and  you\u2019re interested just PM and I\u2019ll  send over the contacts of which you can contact me over Discord or Email.",

            "selftext": " \n\nWhew, its been a while since I've done this- but I think its time to spice things up once again.\n\nI am very fascinated by the supernatural world. I love everything about vampires, werewolves, and witches- at least those particular species. I do enjoy them whether in books, in television, or in movies- and I feel like I want for us to build a world that is dark, seductive, and quite frankly one that can give each of us a good bite. (Get it?) \n\nI'm craving a supernatural story- the details? Who knows, maybe we can agree on that together? Certainly something rooted on the war among the species, an impeding doom they will bring about, an apocalypse within sight, a prophecy rising, or the unleashing of the Earth's deepest and darkest secrets. Either or. But of course love brews- amidst the chaos, a romance springs, two hearts, different species- their bodies, like magnets to metal; irresistible. \n\nLet's create our own world where we can be as sexy as True Blood, as empowering as AHS: Coven. and as engaging as The Vampire Diaries. Taking inspirations from some of those books/shows and calling it our own would be quite an adventure don't you agree? If you would want to use one of those as our permanent background- I can oblige, but I do prefer playing OCs more than anything.\n\nI want for my words to once again have passion. I like to dive deep into every human emotion and blur those lines. Imagine, just imagine, the stories we would tell.\n\nPlease, get in touch with me and lets start an intense but intimate writing journey. &lt;3\n\n*\\* Caveats: I only write heterosexual females, write in third person, I do prefer using face claims and I hope that if you are interested you are at least of a mature mind set. And please, do not dictate on me, as I will not dictate on you. It is, collaboration, first and foremost. And please, let's have an OOC relationship- come on, where's the fun if we didn't?* \n\n*I'm a female way above 25 who is looking for a man in the same age range to write with. And, that goes the same with our characters. I can play those in the late teens or early 20s, but not as mains. I'm in a very different mind space at the moment to have to go back to those times.*",

They were on a journey to loot and pillage. With a new-born child they could not afford to miss out on the last raid before winter. Hilda insisted on traveling with Ulfr, unwilling to sit idly by while her husband was able to loot and fight. She wanted to feel like a warrior even though she was now a mother.\n\n\nDuring their raid Hilda is killed by enemy soldiers while guarding their ships. Before she was slain, she hid the young child beneath her body. Upon returning to the ships, Ulfr and the others were awestruck to find their friends and loved ones massacred and their ships destroyed. The soldiers return once more to mop up the remaining vikings. Ulfr hears his child crying, and removes it from beneath the corpse of his wife. \"Shhh little one. She is in Valhal now. One day we will meet your mother,\u00a0 and we will fight and drink until the end of time.\" For the first time, he shed a tear. He took his child and fled the battle. \n\nUlfr finds himself lost in a foreign land with no food, no ship and a motherless baby alone in a foreign hostile land.\n\n(I would like to play casually, at our own pace. I don't have post length preferences. We can discuss the RP beforehand, but I would like all OOC to be on task about the RP.)",

From the ancient river valleys to the most lewd medieval rulers, i love them all. I wanted to roleplay a storyline that i came up with, and it will have a heavy historical influence.\n\nYour character: This story will center on you, a young but highly capable princess. At a time when no one imagined that a woman could rule a state, you seized the reigns if the kingdom magnificently, turning it from a small kingdom into a regional power. In the process though, you have to put down a few rebellions, and this is where my character comes in. I lead a rebel army and wreak havoc in your state as soon as i hear about your fathers death. Expecting an easy win, you defeat me and lock me away, deciding to show me mercy because i showed you a bit of chivalry.\n\nThis is when the plot gets dicey. A neighboring kingdom decides that they want what is yours, and invade the kingdom. You realize that only with my help can you defeat such a large and powerful army and unite your people. We slowly learn to respect each other, and both prove ourselves as capable leaders, maybe even becoming lovers in the process.\n\n\nThe setting: A bit more about the setting, this story will be set in a small kingdom called Galitia, and your people are called the Galitians. The capital of your kingdom is called Valle\u00e9, a rich town with a castle at its center. Its in the eastern part of the kingdom. Across your kingdom runs a river called the Laugus river, and to the west lies a castle called Eagles Nest. Controlling this castle gives you control over the west. Neighboring your kingdom is a powerful empire called the Alemanic confederacy. Your father, the now dead king, paid tribute to his empire in order to keep them from invading. Since this is medieval, know that most of the kingdom wont respect you on account of your gender. The story will start with your fathers death. The Nobles will push the country to the brink of civil war over who gets to succeed him, as he had no son, only you, his illegitimate daughter. You will take power with the help of your advisor. Some of the Nobles and knights will rebel against you, and how you deal with them is up to you.\n\nThe setup: each storyline will be a season/volume and will be roleplayed in a group chat, (just you and me) our dms will be for discussing anything outside the rp. There will also be a group for alternate storylines or character one shots just to make the universe feel bigger. This other group doesn't have to be used.\n\nThere a few plot twists that i wanna save for the actual rp, the time period can be any you would like, (i would prefer medieval Europe or the middle east) and i would be happy to discuss other matters of the rp if you like! I am also not looking for someone who wants to act like they have no idea how to run a kingdom for the sake of drama, I have had partners do that already, and my god was it annoying. If you like certain aspects of this roleplay but not others, please text me anyway, we can definitely compromise! Hope to hear from you soon!\n\nText me if interested! Thank you for taking the time to read this!",

I checked on the guy turns out after my post he flat out removed me and never gave reason or word what was wrong.\n\nI didn't have much to go from, he wanted a train ride for the plot, I spent 2 days on this person...yet I'm guessing my post weren't ideal to him?

Creating world is my speciality and I'll probably slowly make a whole history for our story overtime. \n\nAbout me:\nI'm a 20+ girl, who just loves writing and making friends and roleplaying is just the right way to do both. I am at least semi lit, I write anywhere from a paragraph to like 7 paragraphs depending on my partner and how pumped I am lol.  I am usually free nights but I do have a job that keeps my busy every so often. Weekends mostly though, \n\nWhat I want from you:\nBe fun and kind, talk to me outside the roleplay, send me dumb memes and junk because I know I will. If you want ANY NSFW elements be over 18 or no go, and don't over do it with the smut, I don't roleplay just to play sex scenes. Quality posts, something for me to respond to is all. Have discord ^^\n\nOther Junk:\n\nI use drawn or cartoon/anime references, RL is a bit offputting to me, but not a deal breaker. I can play MxM, FxF or MxF or pretty much anything else honestly. If you want me to play the guy to your gal or gal to your guy just let me know. I love fantasy, sci-fi, horror, modern monster stories, anime based, harems, monster girls and pretty much everything else. I have some ideas I can get into after you message but if you are craving something don't be afraid to throw it at me! \n\nSo that's all I hope to hear from you guys again lol",

It follows the style of ASoiaF or Brandon Sanderson's books, with the characters (y'all) having lots of character development as you seek to discover the meaning behind the history and magical systems of the world, overcoming personal trauma all while the world begins to collapse around you.\n\nIt will be high fantasy, with magical systems (they won't come up until way down the road) but very realistic and deeply detailed cultures/nations. I have maps made, historical figures, magic systems, geography, and nations all developed already. You will not be told about the lore of the world, only the basics that your character would be aware of, but you may choose to learn about it throughout the game's progress.\n\nAs GM, I will be roleplaying the actions of the NPCs and determining the results of what you attempt to do.\n\nIt will be done on Discord, and it will be long-term. DM me if you're interested! It will be held in 3rd person, and deep characters and serious writing is expected. Due to the lore having a fair bit to do with your character's backstory, I do ask that you make a new OC specifically for this world.",

And I think it would be really fun to roleplay a season of the show as a group, with our own OCs. It\u2019s also easy for new people to join because people get brought in and dumped from the Villa all the time. \n\nI know there\u2019s an iOS game for the show, but I think it would be fun to try to do it this way.

Pretty simple.\nMore details can be discussed, as they can be collaborated on, and nothing that isn't listed above is set in stone. \n\nIf you're interested PM me, and we can talk about things further, and possibly exchange discord IDs. Tell me about yourself and how you rp in the message, please.",

            "selftext": "Howdy all, been a bit since I went searching for an RP partner but I wanna find a new one for a little bit of Fandom RP, the fandom in question being Harvest Moon.\n\nSince this is specific, I'd hope you have some background with the series. I don't care much which game you've played as I'd be happy to RP in any game setting (though I have a few I'd deal like to play in.) Now, there are a few options for what we do though!\n\n1) We both play oc farmers who are friends or sibblings moving into a joint owned farm. We work together, split responsibilities, and pick out love interests from the town we're part of! (This is preffered as I really like equal footing as RPers.)\n\n2) I play the farmer and you can play as one of the canon bachelor's from the game setting we're choosing. \n\nI am all for playing Canon Characters opposite your OC, as long as you do the same. Reciprocation is important and it turns me off when people won't return the favor. That's why I really wanna do a sort of joint farm! Guess it's not dissimilar to the multiplayer update in Stardew haha. \n\nWhen you PM me, please be sure to let me know which HM you'd like to play in, Stardew Valley is also free to be your choice as I love that game. Also, I'm 22 so NSFW is more than free to occur. It's a series with a lot of romance so it's bound to happen but not required!  \n\nHope to hear from you soon!",

            "selftext": "As you wake up in the middle of the night, you see one of your squadmates, Corporal Stype on the bunk next to yours. He was leaning over and obviously whispering to you.  \"I assume you can listen to an impromptu briefing on the run, right? Come on then.\"  He says, slowly getting out of his bed and leading you out of the smaller barracks out into the stary night. \n\nIt was quiet, around 2340 hours and barely any clouds in the dark skies.  Stype leads you out of the compound and to a ranger's cabin, just around a click out from the barracks. It looked abandoned from the outside, but it was decorated with camping gear and supplies from the inside.  Weapons, technology and sleeping bags. After Stype rummages through some of the cupboards and desks, he puts some smaller files, notebooks and a pen into his vest. \"You won't need much from here. Not like this is yours anyways.\"  He says as you follow him back outside through the backdoor. \n\nSoon, the two reach a higher position on a hill, overlooking the beautiful forests and hills of Livonia. A factory compound in the north, a radio tower to the north-east and the barracks to the south-east. The overwatch point was prepared, with folding chairs, a small table and some smaller boxes. With american labels and symbols.  Equipment and tools. Binoculars, UAV terminals and camping gear.   \n\nStype was walking around the small site, checking if everything was as he left it before.  He reaches into one of the crates and takes out a Glock 18, tossing it to you.  \"Try not to kill anything that is avoidable.\"  You take the handgun and holster it in your waist holster, while Stype continues speaking.  \"Go down the hill, I'll explain it to you when we get there. LDF has some stuff they don't want anyone to find. Won't stop us though.\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'll leave it at that for now! I dont know how many will recognize this, but it's based off the new Arma 3 DLC, Contact.  I like the campaign and thought it could make for a great RP idea.  \n\nYou can play whoever you wish. Doesnt have to be Aiden Rudwell, a male or whatever.  Anyone will do. Just prefer some semi-lit to lit writers.  This scene will most likely be SFW, with no ERP. Atleast what I intended it to be. I could have my mind swayed though, if someone wanted to get into mischief with Stype.  This was thought to be a long-term idea, but can be made short-term, incase the Protagonist manages to die, fail the mission or other things happen. It is semi-linear with the pathing, but exploring is possible in the forests of Livonia and even suggested.  \n\nIf I got your interest, do message me on here and we can discuss where we should do this RP. I RP a lot on Discord, but could do it here if needed or no other options are available.\n\nSee you soon, rookie!",

I'm just wrapping up my vacation, but I'll be able to get you 1-2 posts per day when I'm back on Monday. I love to talk OOC and am trying to find a partner now so we can spend some time plotting before we start. \n\nHere are some plot nuggets I have in mind, but I'm so open to what you have in mind too:\n\n- Superhero takes on new apprentice \n- Two rivals are forced to work together\n- A hero and a villain realize there is a much bigger plan at work that could end up causing more harm than good\n- A civilian finds out the identity of a superhero, who now has to keep them safe from people who might want to exploit it.\n\nThat's all I've got. I'm happy to roleplay on Discord, Reddit or Google Docs. Please DM me if you're interested!",

I'm looking for someone who's willing to put in quite a bit of time when it comes to the worldbuilding aspect of our stories, I'm not trying to put in months into the world, of course, and some of it can be developed as we go, but I'd like us to have a strong base before the story sets off. As for the content of said stories, well, I'm looking for anything remotely related to the fantasy genre, as the title indicates. Low-fantasy or high-fantasy, hopeful or grimdark, I don't really care, as long as our setting sticks together.\n\nAs for the kind of partner I'm looking for, I'm just trying to find someone I can befriend, honestly. Have some fine grammar and whatever, enjoy yourself, be open to giving and receiving suggestions and all that sort of stuff. If you've already got an entire setting in your head, I might not be the one for you. I'm hoping to have a more collaborative experience.\n\nThanks for reading!",

            "selftext": "Hey, thanks for checking out my post. You can call me Proto. I've been roleplaying for a few years, been on a few sites and a few groups. I'm recently trying to get into RP again, and it'd be awesome if I could get a partner. I'm very literate, and I expect my partners not to write in broken English. Also, I'm not a big stickler for post sizes; as long as there's enough for me to respond to, and you don't mind writing larger posts when the scene calls for it, we're good.\n\nNow, down to the meaty part.\n\nI'm a sucker for superhero settings. I love watching a person get superpowers and figure out what it means to be a hero while they go through grueling tasks and challenges. I'd like our characters to start off as friends or acquaintances of some kind, and get into a classic accident that gives us powers.\n\n\\-If you don't want to be a hero, don't think you have to immediately do so. It's also fun to watch friends have to duke it out over disagreeing ideals.\n\n\\-I'm thinking the setting could either be a city or large town, so we can have our own imaginative Metropolis or Gotham.\n\n\\-While I'm a fan of both DC and Marvel, I'm imagining the powers in more a Marvel fashion. DC characters are too strong for what I want to do.\n\n\\-We can either set this in a world with a lot of superheroes or very few.\n\n\\-The powers we get and how we get them are still up for discussion. If you want us to be Spider-People or something of the like, that's totally fine. If you want to let more creative juices flow and brainstorm with me for more unique powers, that's also fine by me.\n\nThanks for sticking with me. In short, I want to do a superhero RP, and I'd like to create a lot of the details with someone so we both have stakes in this world. PM me for my discord if you're interested and wanna keep talking :)\n\nSide Note: Smut isn't necessary for me. I'll let that be on the other person's end. And please don't be overly gory all the time. If it's to set a scene with a villain, that can be fine, but if you're constantly ripping out your opponents' hearts and hanging them by their entrails, that's too much for me.",

A few minutes passed, and your door was broken down, an unfamiliar woman behind it, a pistol with a light shining from it, scanning the room until the light rested on you, suddenly turning off and the woman yelling out the door, \"We've got a kid!\" Before kneeling down to you, a small smile on her barely-visible face. \"Hey, are you okay?\" The first nice words you've ever heard.\n\n\n\nHi!

            "selftext": "Hi there!\n\nI'm looking for a medieval fantasy RP today, and I have a somewhat odd and a little weird character I'd like to play, so if you're looking for something more \"normal\" then I'm afraid I'm not the right person for you. If you like a few somewhat more unorthodox things, feel free to read on, and hopefully we can figure something out to write a fun story together!\n\nBefore that, though we should get some housekeeping out of the way. I'm a 22-year-old guy, I live in central Europe in either GMT or CET time zones, and I mostly prefer RPing on Discord these days. I could do Reddit PMs, GDocs, or e-mail as well, depending on what you prefer the most. Right now it's summer holidays as well, so I have nothing better to do but play Destiny 2 all day and RP of course!\n\nAnyway, now that this stuff is out of the way, here's the character that I had in mind for this!\n\nHe could fit into any kind of medieval-inspired fantasy world, although I must admit I really only have experience writing in either European or Japanese feudal societies, but I'm not against trying out other things as well, I do actually have a few things that I wanted to explore in that theme! About the character himself, his name is Maka, and he is a [dragon](https://stmed.net/sites/default/files/monster-hunter-hd-wallpapers-33393-7523380.png) who can also shift into a [human form](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/473966810975322113/sQYtYpwy.jpeg). He'd be somewhere around 400-500 years old, which in dragon years makes him basically a baby dragon. Personality wise he is somewhere in between a very curious and inquisitive human, a feral dragon, and a kitten with boundary issues. He grew up in the forest, so he has no idea how humans are supposed to behave.\n\nI like the idea of him for some reason ending up living in human society, and having to adjust to how humans are supposed to behave, since his personality is kind of like an overly curious kitten with no boundaries, and no concept of his own mortality or how fragile humans are in comparison to him. One thing that I think could work quite well, is if he were to become a permanent addition to the royal household, since in my opinion at least the contrast between his basically feral behaviour against all the different social rules could be quite fun to pit against each other, if he has to learn how to navigate amongst nobility.\n\nI hope this seems interesting to you, and I'd love to chat some more about character ideas and the like! If you're interested, you can PM me on here, and then if you prefer to move to another platform I'll add you on there instead.\n\nHope to talk to you soon!",

            "selftext": " Hellu :3,  \nas you can read in the title I am looking to start a fairy tail roleplay with OCs. I want the roleplay to heavily focus on romance and hurt/comfort. Of course, jokes and funny moments can be included but humor shouldn't be the main theme.\n\nAbout myself:  \nI am female and 21 years old. I was born and currently live in Germany. While I consider my English to be okayish, I can't guarantee that there are no grammar or spelling mistakes. I've been roleplaying for 4 years now and mainly focus on lesbian roleplays.  \nNow to the part that might turn some of you off. I didn't finish watching fairy tail and therefore am not really that into the lore. I don't know everything about fairy tail, which is also why I want the story of our OCs to take part separately from the main story in the anime and fairy tail, as a guild itself. The characters from the anime/manga can have some appearances but only as very minor side characters.\n\nMy Character:  \nName: Elise Rose  \nAge: 19\n\nMagic: Ice Magic  \nSpecial Magic: Under great effort, Elise can combine her ice magic with dark magic, which makes them far more destructive and powerful. The ice is also much harder to control when the dark magic is added.  \nBackground: Elise Rose was born in a small town, actually it is more a village than a town really. Her father died when she was just 2 years old to an unknown sickness. This caused her mother to get very unhappy. She tried her best to work and be there for her daughter but didn't always manage it, which resulted in the young Elise being alone for a long time. She didn't exactly like the other kids in the village. They didn't bully her, they just stayed away from her and so she stayed away from them.  \nEven though her mother wasn't always there for her Elise took one trait from her. The curiosity. Early in her life she already started experimenting with magic, soon forming small ice sculptures which she would show her mother. Once she turned 12 her interest in dark magic also started and she performed multiple dangerous experiments. While her mother had encouraged her to perform the ice magic she clearly didn't like seeing her daughter experimenting with dark magic. But because of her work, she couldn't really stop Elise. After the girl had turned 14, the village in which they lived got attack by bandits, while Elise was gathering herbs. They killed many of the people who lived in the village, pillaged it and kidnapped Elise's mother.  \nThis event changed the Ice magicians life. She wanted to get her mother back, which is why she set herself the goal to fight injustice. She joined a guild and started doing almost every mission she could get. During this time Elise grew up becoming a very attractive woman. Though her values changed. While at first, she wanted to fight injustice with justice and kindness, she got more and more frustrated. Neither was she able to find her mother, who by now is most likely dead and it also didn't seem like the world was becoming a better place. This is why she started getting more and more brutal, using dark magic and other techniques that are forbidden. Other members followed her example since she had become an S rank mage and was seen as a role model. Eventually, a dark guild took this opportunity to start a war against them. They let it seem to the outside as if Elise's guild was the dark guild. This lead to many of the other guild members dying and the eventual disbandment of the guild.  \nThis caused Elise to almost break down. All the friends she had made, her whole family, was now either dead or saw her as a traitor for starting with the use of dark magic. She herself only barely survived and is now wandering around alone. Her goal to stop injustice almost forgotten.  \nOne day she gets caught in a snowstorm. It is almost ironic to her that she an ice mage would die in a snowstorm. The last thing she sees before collapsing is a fierce woman fighting off bandits, who probably wanted to search for any valuable things Elise has with her.\n\nLike I said I didn't finish watching fairy tail and I am not really an expert, regarding the world, it takes place in, which is why I surely didn't get all the mechanics correctly. I would like it if my partner wouldn't be nitpicky about this kind of stuff.\n\nAnyways thank you for reading through all this &lt;3 . If you liked it and decide to give this roleplay a shot please message me. I can roleplay on several platforms and provide a picture of my OC. I would also like it if you would write a small bio (doesn't have to be as long as mine) about your character so we can craft a plot. (You can, of course, wait with that until we have decided on a platform to roleplay on).\n\nBy the way, my favorite ship in fairy tail is Erza x Mirajane so you can maybe get an idea of what sort of romance I like. (yes I know it's an unpopular ship because of Jellal ... but please let me have my dream ship.)\n\nWell ... again thanks for reading and I wish all of you a nice late 2019 and hope you will casually slide into my dm's. &lt;3",

I'd love to do some stuff with OCs, putting them in all kinds of scenarios. I like things like arranged marriages, space pirates, modern magic, cryptids, age differences, found families, and people trying to make it in the world when they feel like they just don't fit. I have a loose plot about a boarding house that's home to all kinds of people from werewolves to a fae and some regular humans thrown in. It would be awesome to populate it with someone else.\n\nPlease be okay with queer ships, trans and nb characters in general, because my OCs are never straight and are rarely cis. I'm only really interested in m/f ships if one character is trans. Otherwise I am down for m/m, f/f, and poly ships. Honestly if we can do some poly ships, I would love you forever.\n\nI rp and do ooc chat on discord pretty exclusively.\n\nIf you're interested, drop me a PM with your name, age, pronouns, and some of the things you might be interested in writing!",

Most of my time I've been role-playing on Kik but now I'm using Discord too. I roleplay both genders and don't mind playing more than one character. \nWhat is important to me is you to like romance, slice of life or drama relationships between a couple of maybe even families. If you want to roleplay just know that I have a list of plots but also you can come up with yours. I do play only in third person. \n\nThank you all for reading this. Anyone who wants to roleplay just hit me up here or in Pms to get my kik or Discord username. Thank you again! Hope to hear from you all soon!",

Hunter/Assasin for the Imperial Empire? A survivor of one of the raided villages?\n\nIts up to you.\n\nIf your interested in giving this RP, feel free to DM me.\n\nI RP mainly on discord, but i also use Kik and Reddit.",

I\u2019ve been having a hard time finding a decent partner to rp with. Just please while you take the time to read this give me to show you I can be a good partner. I have a couple of good plots I would like to try out if anyone is interested. If you have a plot that you would wanna try out I am open to that. I believe that when rping is something two people should be able to enjoy together so I\u2019m open to a lot of stuff. I wanted to mess with my hero genre and give it a twist. I have a few plot ideas I would like to mess with. I wanted to basically throw in static shock into the teen titans world. In comics he\u2019s been part of the titans and helped them etc etc. i wanted to do my own take on what it would be like for him to join. Have him be this new guy who kinda has to prove himself to the team. With your character depending on who you may wanna be I was gonna have them basically be his guide. Help him with questions training exercises and deal with certain dramas. I also wanna do something with young justice as well if your not interested in the teen titans.So if you are interested just dm me.",

In a nutshell, I'm a veteran of the Yahoo/AIM days of roleplaying. My published work spans a wide range of genres, but recently, I've been feeling a pull back into the world of collaborative writing. There's just something tantalizing about being able to explore unique worlds and scenarios with other like-minded individuals. I currently work in a publishing role at a major publishing house, so I'm eager to write and communicate with others who share a similar passion for creating, reading, and producing original content.\n\n**Genres:**\n\nI'm drawn to stories that take an in-depth exploration into character development and character plot arcs. There's something deeply satisfying about following a character's emotional development as a result of interactions with other characters, and/or environmental changes. I'm also drawn to protagonists who challenge the status quo, or that follow unconventional narrative arcs. This can function in a variety of settings, but contemporary fiction, and historical fiction are some of my favorites for this particular approach.\n\n**Basics:**\n\nI'm 29, and gainfully employed. Hopefully you're also someone who understands what it means to balance the \"real world\" with collaborative fiction. I've been roleplaying for several years now (albeit, excluding my recent break), so I'm familiar with expectations for discussion, collaboration, and literary prose.\n\n**Send Me a Message If:**\n\n* You are over 21.\n* You are an advanced/literate writer who enjoys emotional development in characters.\n* You enjoy collaborative mapping of plot arcs.\n* You enjoy the idea of composing a long-term story.",

            "selftext": " \n\nGood day to all you amazing human beings! My name is Maxim and I am currently looking for a new staff team to help with lore writing, moderation, and general server improvement for the fourth incarnation of Mindfall, Aenigma - Mindfall Ultima. \n\nThe general concept of Aenigma is a server that is centered around freedom and creativity. When I first designed the server, the main goal I had in mind for it was to create a server that almost anybody could enjoy irregardless of their preferences and such. That is the reason as to why I did my best to design the lore around and the central theme of the server around being open. \n\nNow, if you would like to read up on the general concept of the lore of Aenigma, it may be found here: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cUhK6mTwkKdywyVdh8dWS\\_dJoa1y1YZNUBQfCwzZ-Jo/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cUhK6mTwkKdywyVdh8dWS_dJoa1y1YZNUBQfCwzZ-Jo/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nThat being said, these are the qualifications for applying for the staff team of Mindfall:   \n1. **You must be flexible and open minded.** This doesn\u2019t mean you have to be wishy washy with your thoughts, it just means that you need to keep an open mind when others are legitimately trying to comment or give thoughts. \n\n2. **You must tell me your fields of expertise.** Since I am specifically searching for a staff team comprised of people to fill different roles, while you may have to expect that you\u2019ll have to do work outside of your may field, I wish to assign each person to a specific role and position that they are most comfortable with. \n\n3. **You need to be respectful and understanding.** This is an obvious given, but something I need to add to this: In the past incarnations of this server fell mainly due to I and members of my staff team constantly falling into arguments where staff members took sides and I had to choose one or the other. I need a staff team that are willing to put aside their differences, stop bickering, and have a civil discussion whenever it comes to an issue. \n\n4. **Don\u2019t be a spoil sport**. Do remember that if you become a staff member of this server, you will be agreeing to a very open and accepting server so if you easily get triggered by certain subsets of people or groups of people, you will either have to hold back and stay respectful or just don\u2019t apply for staff. Sorry. \n\nIf you feel you qualify, feel free to hmu in Reddit DMs so I can send my Discord ID and we can start discussing.   \nIn any case, au revoir to all of you. o7",

            "selftext": "Hi there!\n\n**About Me:** My name is Rae! I am a 24 year old female, and I am in the Eastern Standard Timezone and located in the United States. I have been role playing for roughly 13 years, I am looking for some people who want to build friendship as well as a fun writing experience. I am hoping for someone who realizes that I do have a life outside of this, and I will do my best to reply as often as possible but this is just a hobby for me and something I want to *enjoy.* I will write with anyone! Male, female, anybody as long as you're over 18! \n\nHere are some other little blurbs before I go into my interests:\n\n* 18+ NSFW - It's not a must! However, if it is included in our writing, I would prefer it does not dominate the entire plot.\n* I am SEMI LIT/LIT, I can write in both paragraph or script form, it doesn't bother me either way as long as you give me something good to reply to. I am a quality over quantity, I don't want to stress myself out trying to write 8+ paragraphs when it is not necessary.\n* I am really hoping to find someone that I click with! It would be really nice to develop a friendship, I don't enjoy it as much when it's all business.\n* Doubling up is **mandatory** when it comes to romance/pairings, if I am playing your love interest, you would be playing mine.\n* I play as both OC and CANON characters, I love me some OCxCANON/OCxOC romances, I do not do CANONxCANON (Sorry!)\n* My schedule can be a bit hectic, please don't blow up my messages! I promise I will get back to you and let you know if I need to take a break. I work throughout the week and need to have some family time as well, I answer as frequently as I can! I will give you the same courtesy! I am really looking for friendly, understanding folk so we can create an enjoyable atmosphere! \n* If I get invested in our characters and story, and we develop a good friendship...expect fanart, playlists and all that fun stuff! I think it's fun to gush over the events and such that we're writing! \n\n**INTERESTS:**\n\n* ORIGINAL PLOTS - This is where we can discuss about what we are both interested in! Fantasy, adventure, horror, mystery, we can talk about it!\n* My Hero Academia\n* Game of Thrones\n* D. Gray Man\n* Full Metal Alchemist\n* Final Fantasy VII/X\n* The Walking Dead\n* Junji Ito - I love Junji Ito's works! I've thought about somehow doing something in that realm!  \n\n\nI have so many more so if you have something in mind, feel free to ask me!   \n\n\n**PAIRINGS:** (These are the characters that I would like to ship my OC with! I will be doing the same for you! I have a few in each fandom so don't worry if we have one in common!)  \n\n\nMy Hero Academia: Bakugo / Shoto / All Might / Dabi   \n\n\nGame of Thrones:  Jaime / Robb   \n\n\nD. Gray Man: Kanda / Lavi   \n\n\nFull Metal Alchemist: Roy / Alphonse / Greed / Ling / Archer   \n\n\nFinal Fantasy VII: Vincent / Sephiroth / Rufus  \n\n\nFinal Fantasy X: Tidus / Jecht / Auron   \n\n\nThe Walking Dead: Daryl / Shane   \n\n\nJunji Ito: Souichi (Adult)   \n\n\nSo, if you're friendly and looking for a new partner, let's give it a shot! If you are messaging me, please put forth more effort than a \"hey.\" I usually don't respond to those, introduce yourself and tell me a little bit about you!",

I'll keep it brief here because I'll no doubt reveal more when we RP!\n\n**So that means EU timezones?**\n\nIdeally yes. I'm happy to work with others but it's about how much our times cross and allow us to roleplay. Generally speaking i'm free most of the time, especially on weekends. I have tried to make it work with people in other timezones before, and it just doesn't work out long term. Maybe you're the exception? Who knows!\n\n**Enough faff, what about the roleplay?**\n\nSo what I want is long running story. I want something that is two people doing things. Are they heroes on an adventure? Criminals escaping the law? Explorers establishing a planetary colony? Soldiers in the Roman Army? Any of the above!\n\n*That's a bit vague*, I hear you saying. And you're right! I want our RP to be collaborative. I want it to be a long term combined story. Any good writer will tell you that the best stories focus on development. That's usually character development, and should be in this case. The RP should be about our characters and how they evolve together.\n\n**Okay that's still too vague, settings?**\n\nAny really. I'll list some favourites below;\n\n* Star Trek/Star Wars\n* Modern\n* Historical\n* Futuristic\n* Lovecraftian\n* Lots of game ones! Mass Effect, Dragon Age, Elder Scrolls, Fallout\n* My own homemade fantasy world used in my D&amp;D sessions and novel writing. Does that sound exciting? It bloody well should! ^^It ^^isn't.\n\n**You actually any good at RP? Can you spell proper n stuff?**\n\nI like to think so! Been RPing for close to 2 decades in some form of another at this point. I write novels for fun with a view to publish as a career, so I can write. I can weave a web of a world for us to crawl across, or you can take me for a ride in your ideas.\n\n**So... do I fit the bill? What do you want?**\n\nI want someone who is good at heart and is reasonable with English. If you are European, and your English is passable, that's 10/10 in my book. We'll practise it together! I have a preference for the female persuasion, because for me RP is escapism but I'm honestly happy either way.\n\n**What about dirty stuff? Violence? Swear words?**\n\nYeah to all the above. I'm pretty open. I want my character to evolve with yours. \n\n**So how do I get in touch?**\n\nPoke me here or in private and I'll give you my discord and we'll go from there.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you all!",

Let's see what this new life can bring them.\n\n***Some information:***\n\n\u00b7 am 23 (I expect you to be 20+)\n\n\u00b7 write in 3rd person, past/present tense (it depends)\n\n\u00b7 250 words on average\n\n\u00b7 1 post in a day or two days\n\n\u00b7 GMT+3\n\n\u00b7 tend to use Discord\n\n***This can be counted as an opener:***\n\nHow does it feel to get the heart back? Olgierd had a vague idea how to describe this state with common words. Everything that seemed a simple matter fact in his previous life obtained the color and the taste now. His brother\u2019s death, the loss of his beloved, his own madness. He used to forget what sorrow and pain were like. They were growing stronger with every minute.\n\n\u201cShe still loved me?\u201d he remembered as he had asked Geralt, hardly believing the witcher\u2019s answer. \u201cShe did.\u201d\n\nIris possessed the biggest heart in this dam\\*\\*\\* world indeed. Although even her love and warmth were not able to cure the stone in his chest and make it feel at least something.\n\nHe *does* feel now.\n\nHow does it feel when you wake up from a deep sleep to a piercing pain all over your body? How does it feel when a glass of wine you have drunk turns into the worst poison and it burns your guts from the inside? How does it feel when the air in your length transforms into melted iron?\n\nThe goblet in his hand turns into the mirror of his thoughts. Olgierd is looking at the vinous gloss of his wine and he sees her face. She is as beautiful as she was when he saw her for the first time, holding a brush, pensive and beautiful. She was much more beautiful than the flowers at her painting. She was\u2026 Her gentle lips are distorted with a loathsome grin. A demon is looking at him now from the mirror.\n\nD\\*\\*\\* it.\n\nOlgierd throws the goblet against the wall. It is rolling over the floor, spilling wine on the wood.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you see, I am going to play the red-haired ataman, you are to play Ewald. (This thing can be discussed if you like)\n\nThat's it. PM me if you are interested.",

Treasure hunts, secret societies, murder-mysteries\u2014it's all open for us to explore!\n* Genres: Modern thriller/mystery (think Veronica Mars), Fantasy (High or Low, or modern), Angels/Demons, Sci-Fi, slice-of-life\n* OOC discussion \u2014 I find that a good RP works best when we can plan and discuss the RP, but also I just talk and get to know the person alongside whom I'm creating a world and story\n\nOverall, I'm easy to work with, and I love crafting a good, rich world where our characters can thrive.

It started with making soldiers stronger, faster, tougher. But eventually something bigger was found. A strange energy frequency found in the brains of all living things. When activated with specially designed cells people are given powers out of a comic book. \n\nThese enhanced operatives operate globally to take on the most dangerous and sensitive missions. Including facing off against certain... external threats. They are our first and last true line of defense. They are the cutting edge human capability and advancement in every sense of the word. We are Cerberus, and this is our story. \n\n\nSo this is just an idea I had a minute ago. We\u2019re basically superhumans. There are support troops made up of basic humans with advanced tech to back us up and add numbers as well as to staff the facilities we operate out of.

            "selftext": "Hello all - apologies for this wall of text, but I have a couple of fandoms I'm interested in and then a very specific Marvel idea I'd also be interested in! I'm looking for a M character to my F character, but I don't care about your real gender! I also prefer a dash of romance in my rps but I don't like to rush into them. Smut is a side dish, not a main course for me!\n\n**Sherlock****(Prefer to play with canon characters here, esp Sebastian Moran even though he's.. slightly not canon? I have a very well developed OC I'd like to use with this one)\n\n**Westworld*** (I'd like if it was both OCs, though still FxM, and I'd like to modify the world a little to better fit a long-term rp- I also would LOVE to make a cyberpunk WW - taking place outside of the parks in an AU where the hosts were more widespread is also totally in the cards! Lots of ways to go with this one)\n\nAnd **Marvel*****\n\nI would play Darcy Lewis (weird choice, I know, but I for some reason dig these pairings?), an OFC of mine, or possibly Peggy Carter, but I've never written her so it might take me a little bit to dial in to her frequency. I would like you to play Steve Rogers and/or Bucky Barnes (had one person suggest both and if that's your thing, sign me up). The storyline I had in mind is as follows: Darcy or Peggy or the OC, we'll call just MC (for my character) and Steve or Bucky (S/B) meet in the 1940s, right after the 107th has been rescued by Cap and the Howling Commandos unit is formed. MC is one of the nurses assigned to the unit, where she meets S/B! Cue a few sparks, a budding friendship/relationship, and hopefully a slow burn? And then, of course, a little tragedy. Bucky goes into the ice, and then it's Steve's turn, and then, finally, MC gets grabbed by Hydra and gets the Soldier treatment. The time frame in which MC goes under will probably change depending on the character you would want to play. If Bucky is the character being used we can include a fun little dark interlude with them both working for Hydra, not knowing each other but there's still SOMETHING there - til eventually they are separated again. Everyone ends up in the 21st century, and I was thinking of our characters meeting perhaps a year after the events of TWS - but before CW. Honestly? Kinda throwing CW and everything after it out the window. OUR canon now. So, a year: long enough I think for Hydra programming to have been broken through enough to allow MC to recognize S/B and for Bucky to recognize MC if we're using him. And then from there we can have them take down Hydra and other baddies as we come up with them - this is just a foundation! I would prefer romance to be a decent part of the story, but not to make it all about that INSTANTLY. I think things need to build to a realistic place. From there, NSFW scenes are A-Okay for the most part, but not the core of the story, please.\n\n**About my writing:** I write in third person and past tense, and my reply length varies depending on the current story situation. There are times for long introspection or lots of details, but sometimes all you need is a couple lines of dialogue to keep the story moving. I pretty much always want to mainly play a female character and have FxM pairings, but I'll play side characters of any gender as needed throughout the story. I don't really like doubling, I find it overwhelming. I don't love pairing my characters with other OCs unless it's in certain fandoms (or out of fandoms) and the OC is like... a realistic person, you feel? I prefer to rp with people who have good spelling and a decent grasp of grammar - though playing fast and loose with the rules for the sake of style is totally understandable.\n\nI'm good with writing pretty much anything, but I prefer to rp with those that are 18+, mostly because I'm CERTAINLY not writing smut with a minor. And it's also NOT primarily about the smut. I'm not interested in fulfilling your long line of dirty nonsense that several people have brought to me that have nothing to do with the fandoms I've listed. Sick of that, lads!\n\n**About me:** I'm a 21 year old rper who has been going maybe 7 or 8 years now. I like drama and romance (and some smut) in my rps, and I think rps thrive on good arcs of conflict. Interpersonal drama, dangerous threats, and the (very) occasional dash of lighthearted fun. Again - I mainly play females - but I'll do any side characters who pop in and out.\n\n**I would like you to be:** literate! I don't need purple prose but I'd like a little detail - I like my rps to feel like a good book - it's not a race! Reply frequency does not matter to me - I understand that real life is inevitable!\n\nSend me a message if you're into any of these!",

            "selftext": "Hey you guys. I'm gonna try my best to keep this short and sweet!\n\n----\n\nI am a female, and I'm 20 years old. I'm just looking for somebody to roleplay some good ole modern-day romantic slice of life with. I have grown tired of the fast-paced sci fi adventure stories, and the stressful horror plots. I just want to be a regular degular human navigating through a regular degular human relationship!\n\n----\n\n**What I\u00a0*don't*\u00a0want:**\n\n\n- Anybody under the age of 18. (Preferably 20+.)\n\n\n- Very ong replies. Yes, it's good to be literate, I definitely don't want one-liners or borderline incomprehensable replies, but if you're looking for somebody to write you a novel... I'm not your girl. A good couple of paragraphs is enough! Maybe less - if we're at a mundane stage of the roleplay.\n\n\n- NSFW scenes. Of course, it's a natural part of any relationship, I would just rather is be *fade-to-black* style. Ie: alluded to, but we don't actually have to write out the scenes. I will do it every now and then if you want to, but mainly I'd prefer fade-to-black.\n\n- Any sort of OOC photo trading. I'm not going to send you a selfie of me and I don't expect one of you either :)\n\n----\n\n**What I\u00a0*do*\u00a0want:**\n\n- Simple plots. Even cheesy, cliche plots. (New roommates? Long time best friends growing feelings for each other? You broke into my apartment while drunk one night? We hate each other but we both have a mutual friend so we have to put up with each other? I dunno! Hit me with your favorite plot and we can figure something out. :))\n\n\n- Character descriptions beforehand. Physical descriptions, photo refs, likes and dislikes. Any basic information to give us something to go off of.\n\n\n- Clear communication between us! It's totally fine if we don't click like you thought we would, or if you got bored, or if you're going to be busy. I'd just rather get a warning before ghosting. No questions asked at all! And I'll have the same respect for you. :)\n\n----\n\nSo PM me and we can figure something out for us! I do kik, but I could do discord as well if you'd prefer that. :)",

            "selftext": "1000 years after the events of Dragon Ball Super, Goku and company are long gone. However, their impact on the galaxy and even the universe has turned it into quite the busy place. For one, the descendants of the Frieza Force have formed an even greater superpower know as the Arcosian Empire. As greedy and powerful as they are, there is one organization standing in their way; the Universal Federation. This group was formed by Earthlings and Saiyans alike with the goal of protecting the universe from evil.\n\nBut make no mistake; these two mega-monopolies aren\u2019t the only threats in Universe 7. The Wanderer\u2019s Pledge, which is a group of space pirates more than 500,000 members strong, have been testing the waters recently, seeing what they can and can\u2019t get away with. The Continuum Covenant has been struggling as well; although their religion of Kai and other deity worship is still the primary faith across the universe, there are rumors of a group rising to oppose them, wanting to shift the balance of power into their favor.\n\nDespite all of these big players, our story doesn\u2019t focus on any of them entirely; it\u2019s focusing on you, a beginner-level fighter trying to become more powerful and make a name for yourself. In DBZ: Fight for the Future, you\u2019ll take on missions, hunt down valuable treasures, and rise to greatness just as those before you have. But beware; not everything in the universe is as straightforward as it seems. Sometimes the real threat lurks above...or below.\n\nThis RP is a literate DBZ role play heavily inspired by D&amp;D. It takes the classic feel of Dragon Ball and incorporates most of the typical D&amp;D elements you know and love. With a variety of classes to choose from, a selection of the best races from the show, and plenty of transformations and abilities to unlock, you can construct your ideal Dragon Ball character and choose whatever role you want to play. You can use classic moves from the show, or even make up your own to fit your play style and use on your enemies! If you\u2019re interested, click the link below!\n\nhttps://discord.gg/Vm6UHjW",

            "selftext": "Hey there!\n\nThis RP would be focussing on an adventure with lots of romance, with our two characters against the world, forbidden love or even just exploring the world together! There will be action as that is what i love to write and i think that I excell at it. In the slower periods with no action, there will be romantic scenes (which i also love to write) or high tense yet non-action based scenarios.\n\nI would love for this to take place in the Legend of Zelda universe, especially after the announcement of the sequel to Breath of the Wild. If you have any other ideas of worlds/ Eras that you want to have our RP take place in, please let me know!\n\nThe Characters we would play would be OCs of sorts that fit in the universe. This would be like a Zora Soldier or something of that caliber. Id love for this RP to be a nice mix between a burning romance and an action adventure story against the horrors of Hyrule. \n\nI am only looking for partners that are 18+. Please let me know if you are interested in incorporating some NSFW or smut into our RP with the romance. It wouldnt just be for the sake of doing it but it would make sense with the tension building and stuff. \n\nI dont believe there is anything else i really left out of this post but there probably is. If you need anything else from me, just send me a lovely red or orange envalope and i can definately answer it. I hope to have a very fun and interesting RP with you guys! And as always, all my other prompts are open to RPing too so you can just go through my post history! Thanks for reading!\n\n-Chris",

            "selftext": "Hello hello! I've recently had a RP overhaul; I'm looking for a maximum of three new partners. I write over on Discord, so if I tickle your fancy do DM me with your handle. I'm English and, as I work from home, I am around a great deal of the time. You can count on me to communicate my schedule so I won't simply evaporate on you.  \n\n\n**LOOKING FOR:**  \n\u2022  Modern settings. May be persuaded by fantasy elements. \"Slice of Life\", drama, horror, suspense and character-centric plots. This doesn\u2019t mean \u2018basic lives\u2019 by any means - I\u2019ll take your celebrities, models, stalkers, local freaks, whatever.  \n\u2022 A character (s) who is fleshed out, independent, open for development, change and doesn't hang off of their partner's character in order to be written.  \n\u2022 No drama-mongers.  \n\u2022 Tell me what you enjoy too! One-way enjoyment is selfish, I'm not here for it.  \n\u2022  Consistency. There is nothing worse than a flip-flop character.  \n\u2022  21+ please\\~  \n\u2022 Co-piloting. Collaboration is key, so I'm not doing the entire story-line heavy lifting myself. Ideas? I'd love to heard them! I want to invest in our story.  \n\u2022 Quality over quantity!  \n\u2022 Show me, don't tell me. I enjoy atmospheric writing - cinematic, if you like.  \n\n\n**Writing samples readily available on request.**  \n\n\n**NOTE:** I'm currently primarily using female characters. If you enjoy romance to feature in a narrative, it'll all depend on what character I use. I will play up to three of four characters in one go if the story asks for it. I don't mind what your IRL gender is in correlation to the character you write as.  \n\n\n**You do not need a bio or require a pre-made character. If you have an idea, I'd love to hear it!**  \n*My characters are not who I pretend to be. They are creations of mine and are in no way an extension of real life fantasy, and neither should your own be.*  \n\n\n**I will not RP with self-inserts.** My characters and their themes are not for the faint of heart. Not all is gloom, however, as the thrills of story work comes with both highs and lows. So! If you have an idea or any questions just drop me a message. Please include a writing sample if you have one handy!",

I've improved since then, of course, and am now comfortable with most variations in detail, so long as there isn't excessive detail that doesn't serve a purpose other than adding length.\n\nI'm comfortable with roleplaying something more story based or just doing some simple smut 18+ related stuff. I'm open to more or less all genres and themes. I also don't mind doing certain fandom themed roleplay. In particular, I'd love to do something centered around Fire Emblem: Three Houses, so if you're interested in that please message me! But I'm also comfortably with Persona, Fate, a number of other anime and game series. \n\nAll I require from my partner is that you be female, detailed, literate, and kind!

            "selftext": "Have you ever wanted to be a part of a persistent, long-running role-playing community? A place to make friends, and share in our creative pastime? Are you new to role-playing, or are you a seasoned veteran who strives for a place with a friendly, inclusive atmosphere? Perhaps you seek to polish your writing skills, or are simply a fan of shameless crossover fan fiction? Then you just might find a potential home in the Kingdom of Silvermoon!\n\nSet in a kingdom located on the Earth's moon, the Kingdom of Silvermoon is sustained by a powerful artificial atmosphere which enables life in the Sea of Serenity basin. Civilization, here, has existed since primordial times, and was formerly charged with observing and safeguarding the evolution of life on earth. In recent years, however, this sacrosanct directive has been forced into a secondary concern as priorities have shifted towards survival.   \n\nFor reasons unknown, the kingdom now rests upon an infinite crossroads between realities. It is a land prone to visitation from anything, at any time; either friendly or hostile, on purpose or accident. \n\nHosted in various forms since 1993, the Kingdom of Silvermoon has been around for a very long time. Entire generations of role-players have come and gone, leaving their imprint on the setting. A seasoned moderation staff, an open-ended setting, and endless possibilities await you in this friendly, welcoming community. \n\n* We know no biases towards OCs or canon characters, from virtually any continuity or franchise.\n* We strive to keep drama to an absolute minimum, preferably not facilitating it at all. \n* Our staff and core players are all friendly and welcoming. \n* We house both fantasy and science fiction characters, striving to strike a balance of elements from each genre. \n* We facilitate slice of life RP, and also accommodate those who seek more action-adventure content as they explore the unclaimed riches of a struggling kingdom. \n* We attempt to create a sandbox RP where player interaction is the prime driving force, but also provide direction through regular pre-planned story arcs during lulls as well.  \n\nSo feel free to come and visit us! An entire world is waiting for you and your characters. Given the rules of this subreddit, I'm going to refrain from posting the invite link in this thread. Send me a message, and I'll respond with the link in short order.",

After that incident, many people around the world began to manifest different kinds of special abilities. Much of these people used their quirk for negative purposes, taking advantage of gifts to ruin other's lives. What did society do? Hero organizations had risen all over the world!\n\nIn the year 2050, the world of heroes have changed quite a bit. A lot of hero schools have shut down due to backfires, the only hero schools to stay intact were in major cities. \n\nCurrently in Hosu city, UA had been replaced with a advanced hero school titled Holy Vista High, despite being quite similar to the original UA, Holy Vista was much more advanced yet just as vulnerable. For over 10 years, Holy Vista high had been doing quite well... Until suspicious activity began to occur as staff members disappeared as well as students of all grades. It became a real threat when the bodies of multiple top 10 heroes were found, heavily damaged. hundreds of news reports have recorded evidence of a rising group of assassins with absolute zero mercy.\n\n((**THIS SERVER IS SUPER NEW** and I'm looking for at least 5 admins to help me out!)) \n\nhttps://discord.gg/s9DzEJ7",

So yeah. :\"D\n\nNot looking for that particularly. But you get what I'm kinda after right? Romance is allowed if you want.

I do know I want it to involve my character Aspen.\n\nAspen (My newest gal) is a human who goes on quests, earns gold, and drinks her sorrows away. By that, her inability to become a knight. I do know I want the roleplay to involve quests and story, and interactive characters. More than one maybe. Maybe a whole guild. Who knows?\n\nSo I'm sure we could make up something on the go with that. Uh, just message me if you're interested.

            "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nHello and thank you for take the time to glance through this ad.\n\nI'm looking for a female RP partner, something long-term where we can create a writing partnership and work together on anything that strikes our fancy. I am fairly experienced with 16+ years of RP under my belt, so I am more on the advanced side of literate so you need to be at least solidly literate with my preference veering more towards advanced. I am 31 years old so please be older than around like 24, I just don't care to write with anyone younger than that. I am in the Central timezone and have a lot of availability for the next couple of months. We all have lives of course and I understand that and just ask my RP partner communicate when they can about schedule and post ETA and thoughts on the story. I like being at least friendly with my partners, even if we both maintain anonymity.\n\nWhat I'm in the mood for:\n\n* Slice of life romance. Modern or maybe in a specific decade even. I have tons of pairings and settings we could build off of for this. My favorite slice of life combines the different facets of love and life with a dash of action, a shake of drama, a pinch of conflict. I don't like flat one-dimensional characters or stories. They might start that way, or meek, but character development is super important to me so trust me, they'll always get there. I have some seeds of ideas that we could discuss and develop. \n* Willing to combine these facets with sci-fi, a post-apocalyptic setting maybe, cyberpunk (Bladerunner comes to mind) and even add in more action for these genres if we mix them in. I also like peaceful, quiet stuff like farming and homesteading and stuff like A Quiet Place. Similarly it is also fun to disrupt that peace, and fight to reclaim it.\n* I would be interested in making something around a Princess Mononoke type character. She'd have been either raised in the forest by forest spirits or survived on her own from the time she was very small. Maybe set in a future where humanity has largely abandoned Earth, and your character sees the surface and any who lives there as primitive, but either crashes there or has to go there for some specific reason. A scientist, a soldier, a miner, there are any number of professions that would bring him there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe basics about you and me, I guess?\n\n* I am only interested in female writing partners who prefer to play male main characters.\n* I only play female main characters in mxf pairings. I play any gender for side characters as needed.\n* I roleplay in Google Docs, but I prefer discord for ooc chatter.\n* I do like for there to be ooc chatter so we can share ideas and get to know eachother a bit.\n* Real-life people (actors or models) only for face-claims. Face-claims are a must for me.\n* No hubs. If making a fresh character for each new RP is beyond you or not your thing, I don't think we'll work well together.\n* I write anywhere from 3-10+ paragraphs per post, depending on what the scene or your post calls for. Sometimes I can write anywhere from 15+ paragraphs if a response calls for it or I am advancing the plot forward a great deal or setting a scene.\n* All of my stuff has an element of romance.\n* My style is 3rd person past-tense.\n* Yes to NSFW stuff as long as it's not the central theme. Love and character development are usually the central themes in my stuff.\n* No anime, school/university or anything canon. VERY rarely will I do fantasy, and GoT was the only \"medieval-ish\" inspiration I drew from and that got ruined so I'm out on Medieval stuff too. No ty.\n\nIf you have a sample, I'd love to see it when you PM me! No sweat if you don't have one available, though.",

I\u2019m hoping to find somebody to create a Blade Runner 2049 line with as I\u2019ve fallen right back in love with that universe!\n\nI\u2019m 21+ and I prefer my writing partners to be too as I do like to explore darker topics as relevant to the storyline. I write in 3rd person present or past tense, whichever you prefer. I like to focus on character development, world building, and being able to create a story we both enjoy! I prefer quality over quantity, however I do tend to write 2-3 paragraphs depending on what is going on in the scene, but understand the need for pacing, so can write less to keep things moving along. \n\nI write exclusively canon characters, with the exception of side characters used for plot. And while I enjoy taking what canon gives us to work with, I also really love being able to put our own spin on the universe and characters we play. I also don\u2019t mind writing NSFW scenes, but do like to keep the plot going as well. \n\nI have a loose idea that I would love to write out with somebody as I\u2019ve been dying to write KD6 for a while now. I\u2019d like to be able to explore his past and present with him struggling to work through perceptions and trauma. I always visualized Ana Stelline and K growing closer and working through it together, but I am definitely open to brain storming! \n\nI don\u2019t mind where you are on the gender spectrum as a writer and I honestly don\u2019t mind if Stelline is kept traditionally female, or we redesign the character to more fit what you would like to write. \n\nAnyway! Please shoot me a message if you\u2019d be interested in writing something like this with me!",

We pick a plot, try it out, if we like it we stick with it, maybe make it something we can finish up quickly. If we don\u2019t like it then we try something new. \n\nI\u2019m a 22 year old female in the US. I don\u2019t mind playing males in some of the instances depending on the plot. I love fantasy, slice of life, history, supernatural, you name it. I prefer using Discord. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested shoot me a message!",

            "selftext": "Hey there. I'm looking for someone to create an amazing, gripping story with. The main theme I like to play is romance but we can also add different elements into it if you wish. Please note though, fantasy is a big no! I would really appreciate it if you were reliable, and tell me if it got boring because then it's fair. If you ghost me, don\u2019t expect a sudden second chance. Of course we will both have our own personal lives but I\u2019ll always communicate healthily and let you know when I\u2019m busy. If you're going to message, be serious about this too and have a clear idea about what you want. I can do first or third person, I can change my preference if needs to be. Honestly, I will NOT accept one liners nor will I respond back to you if you're just gonna ghost. I've had enough of people just coming along for short-term purposes when this is LONG term. I cannot stress that enough.\n\nMy list:\n\n\\~Friends from childhood.\n\n\\~Roommates.\n\n\\~Nurse and Solider/veteran.\n\n\\~Prince/Princess falls for a village girl/boy.\n\n\\~Friends with benefits\n\n\\~Rich Entrepreneur and interior designer.\n\n\\~Gang member and innocent girl.\n\n\\~Strangers\n\nAnd of course, any other ideas you wish to tell me about. Yes I know these are mildly clich\u00e8, so I\u2019m willing to spice them up and add a lot more angst, or even some dark themes if it does fit with the idea. \n\nSmut will have a very small element in this, but it won't be too overpowering as I want to enjoy the story at its fullest - so it will be discussed fully once the plot has been established and there will always be a good build-up before any NSFW. When it happens though, I'll make sure to attend to your every need. I cannot stress this enough; Please be literate! (more than a paragraph at least). If you deliver on that, I will too. Roleplay is a two way mutual thing and it has to flow in order to keep a story going. \n\nThanks for reading! I use Reddit and kik. If you have any other platform, I\u2019ll be sure to download it if I can but I really do prefer the two I\u2019ve mentioned.",

            "selftext": "**Introduction**\n\nHi, hello!  I'm rat and this is my ad!  I've been role playing for close to thirteen years now, give or take, and I play characters of all genders and in M/F and F/F pairings.  I've tried to get into M/M pairings but I don't feel like I write them well enough, unfortunately.  I am looking for **plot-driven RP over Discord**.  If my idea here interests you, or you have any questions at all, don't hesitate to throw me a private message!\n\n* **Story:** Nothing is greater to me in role play than character development.\u00a0 I'm a huge fan of the story and the journey, and if you're just looking for a quick romp between our characters then unfortunately this isn't the thread for you.\n* **Quality:** I'm less picky about how many paragraphs you write than how well you write them.\u00a0 We all make mistakes and I'm not going to judge you for a spelling error or some typos, but I'd like to see some creative descriptions and effort put into posts to keep us both interested.\n* **Communication:** Silence is the RP killer.\u00a0 If you need to take a break due to real life, or you're not happy with the direction the RP is going, please say something!\u00a0 If we don't communicate things won't last very long, and it's a two way street we should both walk together.\n* **Activity:** With my work schedule and lifestyle I can usually post once every three days to several times in one day.\u00a0 I understand if you're a busy person with limited time for writing, but anything beyond three days without communication is difficult for me to get into.\n\n**The Plot**\n\nAnd now for the most important part!  I recently was inspired to play Skyrim again, as we all are unfortunately want to do, and after installing a heap of mods I found myself really enjoying the character I built.  I would like to explore some text adventures with Ekkara Windeye, my Nord Sorceress, and a fellow adventuring companion/childhood friend.  I want to leave most things as vague as possible so you are free to design the character that *you* want.  Do you want to play a male or female?  Go for it!  Want to be a Nord, Khahjiit, Dunmer, or Imperial?  I'm game for it all!\n\nEkkara is eager for adventure, but given the sign she was born under she's both talented and cursed with magic.  She's an Atronach, making her a capable spell caster - until she runs out of magicka, then she must recharge her energy by being struck by other spellcasters or drinking potions.  She could certainly use someone to watch her back and keep her from getting into too much trouble.\n\nRomance is a welcomed theme here.  I'm partial towards slow-burn, and F/F pairings on top of that, but I can be convinced to do something involving M/F.  Ideally I'd like to chat for awhile and figure out the best pairing we can make with my wizardly Nord and whatever you're interested in playing.  For the plot standard adventurous themes are the goal, and we can work on coming up with a main quest for them to work through.\n\n**In Closing**\n\nThank you so much for reading through my post!  I hope by this point you're interested in what you've seen, and you have some ideas you'd like to share with me.  Feel free to send me a private message, and if we hit it off and I like what you've got, I'll give you my Discord!\n\nTake care, looking forward to hearing from you!",

            "selftext": "Introduction\n\nHello fellow writers! My name is Beretta and I'm looking for a collaborative writing partner. However before we get into all that I should probably share a little bit of information about myself. I live in a small quiet town on the east coast of the United States. I am twenty two years old and have been writing and developing stories since I was introduced to tabletop games and various writing forums back in middle school. I'd like to think my skill has improved since my humble beginnings but ultimately that isn't for me to decide. All in all I'd wager that I have seven to eight years worth of experience in writing multiple characters and creating various worlds.\n\nI stumbled upon this subreddit on my hunt for like minded authors eager to share the creative process of both world and character building. I am currently working and have a life outside of my sordid affair with writing. That being said writing these stories is my main creative outlet for voicing my emotions and thoughts. \n\nWriting Preferences\n\nMy preferred writing style is third person past tense and I tend to write multiple paragraphs. That being said I do prefer quality over quantity as I would much rather have the visceral detailed thoughts and feelings of a character than meaningless fluff. When it comes to Genres I tend to be flexible as long as the plot grips me and I can clearly see a skeleton for a fantastic story. That being said I shall make a short bullet point list of my more experienced genres.\n\nI enjoy writing stories with darker and more mature depictions of life and it's many pitfalls. I noticed in my reading of various posts that it is customary to specify one's view on possible NSFW scenes. My view is that I can both write those scenes or fade to black for my partners preference. That brings me to my next point I am not here for SMUT stories. I am here to write gripping stories with action, drama, and slow burning romance. I want to watch and write for characters who change and develop over time in direct reaction to the trials and tribulations they face on their journey towards the destination.\n\nWhen it comes to romance I do have a preference for hetero pairings as I have the most experience in that department. That being said I am more than happy to double up as I love writing multiple characters. My main characters tend to be hetero males but as I mentioned I add in supporting characters.\n\nPlots\n\nSupernatural\n\nIdea #1 (Vampire Slayer X Vampire)\n\nMost of humanity lives in ignorant bliss of the shadow stalkers. He was not one of them. The blood of hunters pulsed through his veins. He had never thought twice about laying them to rest. Then he met her.\n\nIdea #2 (Vampire X Human)\n\nHe had spent centuries withdrawn from mortal society. That time had been spent practicing the fine arts and reading any book he could find. Until one day he just lost the taste for scholarly pursuits. He began living like a hedonistic undead rockstar. Then one day while out on the town he met her.\n\nIdea #3 (Cop X Witch)\n\nA lot of folks thought rural life was boring but they had never been to his town. It was a haven for supernatural creatures with both light and dark natures. In the daytime it was magical and quirky but at night all bets were off. His job was to protect the town by any means necessary. However things become complicated when a mysterious woman moves to town.\n\nIdea #4 (Cop X Mermaid)\n\nOne day when a young boy was swimming off the cape something magical happened. He saw a young mermaid. She swam up and kissed him before disappearing. Time passed and the boy grew into a young man. He was a local deputy and widowed father just living a quiet life. Then one day while out on patrol something unusual happened. A woman washed up on the shore with no memory of who she was or where she came from. Could this be a second chance?\n\nMedieval Fantasy\n\nIdea #1 (Knight X Princess)\n\nDespite being one of the most skilled knights in the king's guard his career had stalled. It seemed his love for strong wine and beautiful women had not gone unnoticed by his peers. As the princess prepared to entertain suitors the king made arrangements for her to have a personal guard. The Knight Commander saw it as an opportunity to straighten him out. It was his shot at redemption.\n\nIdea #2 ( Slayer X Witch)\n\nHe had been born into a world plagued with war and disease. He had been born a nobody. It wasn't until he wandered into the untamed lands that he found his true self. He became a slayer of nightmares. He traveled the lands accepting contracts to hunt monsters. He never thought twice about it until he found himself far north in the Iron Forest. That's where the mythical witch of the wilds was rumored to rule.\n\nIdea #3 (Gladiator X Princess)\n\nAn exiled warrior who sold his services to a warlord. His sole purpose was to shed blood and sweat on the sands inside the arena. A steady flow of wine and pouches full of coin were just some of his spoils. However all his treasures paled in comparison to her. The one true jewel of the desert.\n\nModern Fantasy \n\nIdea #1 (Cop X Partner)\n\nA detective in the Major Crimes Squad finds himself without a partner. Tensions are still high after the metahumans riots but crime doesn't rest. A rift still divided the department from the five boroughs. The streets have never been more dangerous but someone's got to do work.\n\nCyberpunk Dystopia\n\nIdea #1 (Cop X Partner)\n\nThe world is run by corporations and their private armies. The poor are nothing but pawns in the games of the wealthy. They are forced into crime just to afford the basic amenities. The city's police department is underfunded, undermanned, and overworked. However someone has to attempt to keep law and order in an otherwise lawless society.\n\nSlice of Life\n\nIdea #1 (Bodyguard X Client)\n\nHe was well trained and no stranger to combat but he still felt nervous. His client had a reputation of being independent, strong-willed, and opinionated. These weren't bad traits but it could make a client difficult. There would always be people who think themselves above protection. The truth was that nobody wanted protection until it was too late. What neither counted on was two polar opposites falling for one another.\n\nIdea #2 (Cop X Stranger)\n\nA young cop and widowed father leads a quiet life in his hometown. It's one of those places where everyone knows your name and waves to you on the street. It seemed frozen in time and resistant to the changes of the larger world surrounding it. That's why when a mysterious young woman shows up in town rumors began to spread. Everyone wanted to know the story of the woman tending bar at the Red Pony.\n\nScience Fiction\n\nIdea #1 (Captain X First Mate)\n\nThe aftermath of the great war left a clear divide between the factions. The inner planets were civilized and technologically advanced. They were ruled by the iron fist of the Coalition and it's military. The outer rim border planets were lawless and lacked the fancy Coalition tech. The border planets were havens for former independent soldiers and criminals alike. In order to survive the verse you need a fast ship and a skilled crew. That's what brought him to Fortuna.\n\nThese are just some vague concepts I came up with. These can all be discussed and changed based on the input of ideas from my partner. I'm also open to brainstorming new plots and pairings with my partner.\n\nIn regards to fandoms I tend to keep my distance. I love certain worlds and would love to write stories in them but my past experiences have made me wary. I don't like having my narrative freedom restricted by someone else's rules or regulations. I tend to only do fandom if it's an alternate universe and we play OC's with occasional canon cameos or references.\n\nPartner Preferences \n\nNow comes the part of the Ad where I describe a compatible partner. I have no experience requirement as I am willing to work with both novice and veteran writers. I would ask that you have the passion for story telling and a love for building worlds and characters. I am a talkative person especially about story and character ideas so communication is a must. My parent's taught me that you get what you put in so if I am putting a hundred percent then I'd like the same respect. I would like for them to most importantly be kind.\n\nIn terms of responses I would like at least a post a day or simply a response saying you can't post that day.\n\nConclusion\n\nIf this gripped you or made your creative spark flicker please message me privately. Tell me a little bit about yourself, what in the Ad really grabbed your attention, and what types of stories you enjoy writing. I'll be sure to get back to you as soon as possible.\n\nThanks for taking the time out of your day to read the ramblings of a young aspiring author. I wish all of you the best of luck in your searches for a fantastic partner. \n\nTo my future partner I look forwarded to reading your message and the journey forward creating brilliant and beautiful stories.",

Basically, a class of students (in the case of this roleplay I'll be increasing it to three classes, equalling 120 students total) are taken to an island and forced to kill each other in a Battle Royale style match until only one student remains. In this world though, the students are left on a much larger island, and their only goal is to survive on this island for four years. However, on this island are many dangerous things; wildlife (&lt;-- is the password), squads of mysterious soldiers that aim to kill anything they see, strongholds guarded by military, and a zombie virus that spreads between infected individuals. \n\nIf you have any questions or are simply interested in this roleplay, shoot me a message!",

            "selftext": "My most recent posts asking for open fantasy ideas have allowed me to meet some impressive and amazing people! I\u2019m thinking I have enough free time and energy to add one or two more roleplays to my arsenal. This time however, I have a basic idea to start on.\n\nA little about me, I\u2019m a 21 year old Male in the central time zone. I do work about 30-40 hours per work, usually in the afternoons. However, I\u2019m allowed to be on my phone sparingly at work. I can reply usually pretty consistently, and after work I\u2019m usually up pretty late. \n\nNow, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re not reading this to hear my personal experiences or sparing details. You came this far because you are salivating at the thought of a brand new fantasy idea.\nOkay, maybe it\u2019s not *brand new* but, it\u2019s something I\u2019ve been fixated on for awhile and have never attempted to try. I wanna do a good guy gone bad. A hero\u2019s fall from grace into the evil clutches of villainy. Now a few things about where I\u2019m trying to go with this idea. \n**First**, it will be my hero choosing to go down the dark side. It won\u2019t be because of brainwash/magic/etc. it will be because of some morality change inside him, what that is I\u2019m not sure yet. That\u2019s where you come in! \n**Second**, this will be at least mid fantasy, if not high fantasy. Magic, mythical races, and the basic fantasy world characteristics will be prevalent in this roleplay. \n**Third** and final thing, as stated in the first point I need your help as i purposefully don\u2019t have everything figured out yet. That is because I want us to work together on this idea. Does he change due to his most basic emotions? Is he just tired of the good guy mentality? Does he witness something that completely changes his outlook on the world? Now before you go too much into thought, there\u2019s also another thing we need to figure out together. Your character! Is she my evil partner in crime? Is she an ex-party member turned rival now that he\u2019s evil? There\u2019s a wide range of possibilities. \n\nI appreciate if you have made it this far still interested. There\u2019s a few more minor things I would like you to indulge me on. I rather enjoy OOC chatter, getting to know your partner feels like a necessary foundation for a strong roleplay. Also, please at least write paragraph length responses and be semi-lit. I\u2019m fully aware not all situations will call for a fully detailed multi paragraph reply. These aren\u2019t deal breakers, but just some things I would greatly prefer! \n\n**One last thing I require** is that if you send me a PM interested, please include your favorite video game. If not a gamer, include your favorite band. If you don\u2019t play video games or listen to music, are you even human?",

I'm looking to make a small server focused on horror, mystery, and danger in the 1920's. What happens is up to the players where I'll simply server as a guide through the world, bringing interesting mysteries and dangerous horrors along with some light dice rolling mechanics.

            "selftext": "As the title suggests...and yes there is really a disabled action sports star in a wheelchair that does this...\n\n*NOTE: THINGS CAN BE SWITCHED UP A BIT IF YOU'D LIKE*\n\n\nThe basic setup/premise would be something like some mutual friends set us up through a blind date so you kind of suspect it to be a typical Action Sports athlete like a BMX or Freestyle Motocross Rider since you all hang out around the same group of friends but when the date comes you see me in the wheelchair and immediately think I'm a retired Action Sports athlete due to injury but it's the complete opposite. I have been doing what I like to call WCMX (Wheelchair Motocross) &amp; making a comfortable living off of it getting big-time brand deals from Monster Energy &amp; Redbull and I travel the world with different groups of friends that ride dirtbikes &amp; BMX &amp; what not doing roadshows all over the place as I\u2019m known for doing big tricks like 360s in my chair and I recently started doing backflips and front flips off the \u201cbig air\u201d BMX ramps traveling around with the big Action Sports group of friends compiled of FMX/BMX riders &amp; Skateboarders called Nitro Circus (Could be called something completely different. It doesn't have to be 100% accurate.) We would eventually hit it off you being a little skeptical at first but then I like invite you to an event and you can see what I do in action and we can kinda just wing it from there. There will be some NSFW things, some action, some injuries (mostly to me lol), affection &amp; maybe a little bit of drama here &amp; there. I know this probably won't get anyone's attention but this has been yet another idea i've been wanting to do.\n\n\nHere's kind of an example of what this sport would be like and kind of like how my character would act but he'd be a little more low key and kinda rough around he edges being kind of a smartass.

            "selftext": "Hi there!\n\nI'm  an experienced roleplayer of about 5 years now, and I'm looking for a  new long term roleplay partner who would be  interested in building a **romantic relationship**, based around the concept of a famous, **Hollywood Starlett** falling in love with an ordinary guy.\n\nThe most important aspect of this roleplay should be **Chemistry.**   Our characters should be able to bounce off each other like   trampolines, joking, flirting and teasing to the point where the  chemistry is clearly visible to anyone nearby.\n\nThere's  something I find really alluring about a world famous Hollywood actress  somehow falling in love with a sweet and caring average Joe. I love  exploring how their very different worlds cross - does she have to keep  him a secret, to protect her image? Does she get to flaunt him off at  red carpet events? Perhaps he gets overly chatty with her co-star, and  she gets red with jealousy? When he brings her home for dinner, how do  his friends and family react to sharing the prawns with someone who  headlines their DVD covers? How bad will the arguments be, when she  informs him she has to do a romance scene with Dave Franco in her next  movie? There's so much to explore!\n\nI'd  love to explore all the ins and outs of this idea, and if you have any  potential new twists or ideas, feel free to suggest them! I would like  to be playing the Male role in this RP.\n\nLook forward to hearing from you!",

            "selftext": "Hi, I'm looking for partners interested in a role-play set within the Destiny universe from Bungie. Although it would help if you're familiar with the Destiny universe, this isn't required, since you could always play a recently risen guardian who's discovering the world for the first time.\n\nIt's important to me that you be a descriptive role-player. I really enjoy when I can get really in-depth on the world building in role-plays with my partner, and I hope you enjoy that, too. I also like it when we both control multiple main characters, instead of just each having one main character. I find this makes it easier to write character-interactions.\n\nI currently have two ideas for role-plays based on the lore of the game. By all means, though, if you have other ideas, or if you want to create something different together, I would love to read what you have in mind. You do not have to pick one of these options.\n\nMithrax, the Forsaken\n\n-Misraaks (mispronounced Mithrax) is a fallen Kell hoping to unite the fallen under the House of Light's banner. He has conducted several secret missions with a fire-team of guardians and is an ally of the city. We could play as members of this fire-team as they work to unite the fallen before other factions like the House of Devils become too powerful.\n\nAthenaeum Worlds\n\n-Emperor Calus has powerful weapons stored in secret vaults in distant Athenaeum Worlds. However, when Calus was deposed by Gaul, he lost all information on where these worlds are. We could play guardians recruited by him to find these worlds and brave the dangerous secrets they hold. Alternatively, we could help the Drifter loot them for ourselves.\n\nThose are my two current ideas, but again, if you have any other ideas, I'd love to read them. Also, if you have ideas for characters you'd like to play, I'm definitely interested. Lastly, I'd prefer to role-play in private messages on Reddit, so feel free to send me a message if this sounds interesting to you. I'm always open.",

            "selftext": "Hi! I am a literate, experienced writer looking for Marvel-based RPs. I have been roleplaying online for over seven years. I am +18 and I write in novella style (upwards of 200-500 words per reply) over Discord or email. Currently, I'm pursuing a degree in creative writing in a variety of mediums. I'm passionate about collaborative storytelling... and superheroes.\n\nMy interests cover both the MCU and the comics. The role I'd like you to play is bolded, followed by the role I will be playing, and then a description of the plot.\n\n**Clint Barton** &amp; Kate Bishop\n\n* *(Dystopian, Survival, Angst, Action, Hurt/Comfort)* This plot is set in a dystopian future where heroes are collected and traded as commodities. The Hawkeyes are captured separately and do not cross paths for several years. When they are finally reunited at a collector's party, they make an improbable escape and set out for the Mexican border in a stolen car. Subsisting on nothing but pickpocketed cash and uncountable traumas, Clint and Kate go on their last mission together.\n* *(Hurt/Comfort, Domestic, Platonic Relationship Negotiation)* Kate is reminded of the Central Park incident and Clint notices her change in behavior. Perhaps a misunderstanding occurs between them. Regardless, Kate opens up about a traumatic episode in her past and Clint takes a moment to re-evaluate their relationship.\n* **Bruce Banner**/Betty Ross\n\nMy ideas for this pairing are much less structured. I\u2019m interested in them as a romantic couple, unlike the Hawkeyes. But generally, I\u2019d like to see them dealing with their individual parental issues (and residual traumas) or rebuilding their relationship after the events of the first Avengers movie.\n\nI\u2019ve been playing Betty for a while. She\u2019s a mix of both comic and MCU canon. So please hit me up if you\u2019re interested in learning more about my take. I have writing samples and a work of fanfiction on AO3.\n\n...\n\nMy ideal partner would be an experienced writer, **at least 18 years old**. This partner would be dedicated to **literate, multi-paragraph responses** as well as character development. I'm looking for someone to **write male characters**. Hopefully, my partner will also be **fairly active,** able to average about one response a day. General friendliness is also important! I'd love for our partnership to be longterm.\n\nMy writing samples are available upon request.\n\nIf this sounds interesting, please PM me! I can't wait to get started.",

            "selftext": "***All content in the post below is intended for ages 18 and above, aka 18+.***\n\n**This   will be a persistent request I will repost on a near-regular basis. I   don't check Reddit often during the day, but I check it daily. Whoever I   am playing with, do not take it personally. It's just habit.**\n\nFirst, a few things about myself.\n\n33 years old, East Coast US, full time weekday worker (the whole 40 hours and more). Craving RP with any and all interested.\n\n*Please   don't be discouraged by everything here. Some things did require more   context to make sense, especially The Catch section. The best we can do   is try with each other. :)*\n\n***Basic Requirements and Options***\n\nThird person RP only, Discord is necessary.\n\nWhat   I seek is female characters (IRL gender does NOT matter) opposite any   of my males/females/inbetweens aka intersex characters. In what, you  may  ask? Look below (anything in bold is a big want with me):\n\n\\-Modern (includes fantasy, **slice of life, drama. I love the whole \"love, marriage, baby carriage\" angle in any relationship I do in a story**).\n\n\\-Historical (**Medieval (vikings/Norse/Saxon/Crusades/Plantagenet/Tudors era**), Victorian/Wild West eras, **1940s/1950s/1960s play**)\n\n\\-Fantasy (this goes into either of the genres above)\n\n\\-Fandoms (Marvel/DC, Once Upon a Time, **Star Wars**, **Game of Thrones aka A Song of Ice and Fire**, Peaky Blinders, **Harry Potter/Fantastic Beasts/Wizarding World,** Vikings, The Last Kingdom; **Persona 5, Final Fantasy 14 (FFXIV)**;   others need ask. But PLEASE ask me on the possibility of playing canon   characters from these shows. There is no guarantee I may be able to  play  what you want. Feel free to ask on other fandoms not listed! Some  may  have escaped my memory in making this.)\n\n***Writing and RP Style***\n\nAs   for visuals, I have gotten dependent on them. Superficial, lacking   imagination on images? It is. But I've played in public SLs over the   years who have regularly embraced them, so it's ingrained on me.   Usually, actors/actresses/models and the occasional art.\n\nI   favor adult writing and want the same from who I play with. Give me  the  romantic, intimate, and everything beyond it in detail (those that  know  what this means will get it :) ). I also enjoy players who like to  talk  OOC.\n\n***The catch?***\n\nI got it down to three simple statements:\n\n1. Embrace   communication. I love those who are around daily or near-daily. I also   understand that RL kicks in, since I have it happen too. I'll give a   heads up on anything, as long as I get one in return. And if I feel like   something isn't working out, I'll say so. I only ask the same in   return. We can work things out if we try!\n2. Be   open minded or cool. If you're bothered by being asked on what ages  you  play, or a greeting given while you're on Do Not Disturb, or  anything  petty like that, then please move on. I don't have patience  for those  who exhibit negative responses to something that doesn't  justify it.\n3. No   ghosters or flakers. You contact me and we work out an idea, I expect   you to keep vocal about it. You don't want to play anymore? Tell me so   we can both move on and I don't bug you with a couple of messages a  day.  If I don't hear from anyone for a week (unless they give me  notice), I  move on. People may contact me later on if they want to try  again,  though, but no guarantees.\n\n***Conclusion***\n\nFeel   free to PM me for my Discord name or offer yours (with the 4 digit   number at the end) when you message (no need to wait!). I apologize for   the long winded post, but it's the best I can do. Any interested folks   who PM me, please throw in a \"marvelous\" somewhere so I know my post  was  read rather than the title. :) I look forward to meeting everyone!\n\n***All content in the post above is intended for ages 18 and above, aka 18+.***",

Which, with that in mind, is the sort of thing I aim for in any RP when I write seriously with people. Long, glorious tales of men and women and others and their personalities that bring them into conflict - you'll often find that my writing samples come from AUs **of** the worlds they and I made together. FanFiction, essentially, of our own creations to come up with odd, surreal content that couldn't realistically take place in the canon universe.\n\nWhilst these spin-offs might have some some form of modern or non-medieval setting to them, I have very little (less politely: none) interest in stuff that goes beyond the reach of fire and sword technology for a world - worldbuilding's a big thing for me. I like things making sense. Realism is irrelevant, but things being logical is important to me when looking at the worlds my partner(s) make for me to partake in.\n\nThat being said, the actual way I write tends to be in multi-paragraph/novella format that often spills into borderline purple prose as I get into it, flowing together pretty, flowery words to describe places, characters, events, battles - whatever. Artsy words are my thing.\n\nI'll leave my preferred content of stories to my RP requests, and for the sake of succinctness, cut myself off here. Pleasure to meet'cha'all.",

            "selftext": "The Dragon Harvest Festival, a time to thank the gods for a bountiful harvest. You sat upon your seat amongst the other members of *The Council*, a group of nobles who ran the town Tsal. You looked over the large party in the square, watching as people danced and drank away their troubles. The council talked amongst themselves, deciding what to do in the coming year to prepare for the coming war. \n\nFor years province of Esrouc had been harassing your province of Enod. Tensions were always stiff, with very little going between the groups but now war was at the doorstep, banging on it with iron fist. The general of Esrouc was a cruel man from what you heard, commanding an army that more than tripled your own. You were afraid, like all the other nobles. A few had suggested increasing the size of the army, drafting the capable young men but it was denied as your army would still be too small. \n\nListening back in on the conversation, you heard the new plan that was seemingly getting more positivity. \n\u201cIf we leave in one week we\u2019ll have enough time to gather our supplies and pull out from this city. One of the other provinces will take us in, even if they refuse they will not be able to refuse our gifts!\u201d Said one of the older nobles, Desme. The others were nodding in agreement, seemingly alright with leaving an entire town of innocents to fend of an army. Standing up, you announced you were retiring to your quarters for an early night. Going back inside, you collapsed onto your bed, thinking of how you were going to stop this bloodshed from happening. \n\nYou awoke suddenly, the sound of screaming breaking the silence of your room. You sat up quickly, the entire room dark save for some moonlight peeking through the crack in your door. But soon that too was blocked by a figure. The door opened slowly to reveal what looked like a young woman, her lower face covered by a mask. A sword hung in her right hand, blood dripping from its blade. Footsteps of guards stomped on the lower levels, running to try and get up to the floors. The woman didn\u2019t seem worried, moving across the floor slowly towards you, her blue eyes seeming to shine in the darkness. The blade was brought up to your chest, the woman\u2019s palm pressing against the base of the hilt gently. But it was enough for you to feel the sting of metal cutting skin. You looked into the woman\u2019s eyes, cold and calculating. \n\n\u201cThe others have already died, do not resist and I shall grant you a swift death coward.\u201d She said, her voice as light as the shining moon, seeming to be the wind speaking within your ear.",
