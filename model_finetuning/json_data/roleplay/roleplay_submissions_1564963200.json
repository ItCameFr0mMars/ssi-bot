            "selftext": "\"Do not glare so. Your freedom will be the wars you wage. What of your family? Already dead, the last of the losses you have suffered. Now *kneel.*\"\n\nThe breath is forced out of you as a gloved fist makes itself acquainted with your stomach, prompting you to crumple to the dimly lit tiles on your hands and knees. That was quite enough questions from a serf. The night air wraps its icy fingers around the trio, a pair of fluttering cloaks stood looming over a shivering body. A smug aristocrat gives a nod to the guardsman beside you and you are dragged to an upright position, your arms hanging limply in a vice-like grip. It wasn't quite as awe-inspiring a move as an invisible force to make you bend the knee or a strong wind blowing you on your back but hey, one works with the tools at one's disposal. \n\nIf any other member of the Empress's Court had been at hand to judge your crime you would be swinging from the gallows by now- or worse. Incinerated. Cleaved on the spot. Entombed alive. Your mind broken as every thought, feeling and emotion you ever had was ripped from your soul. The elite of society could be so cruelly inventive with the supernatural abilities that signified their right to rule. Life is as it always had been; the strongest of society constitute the aristocracy, the weakest being the commoners who were born without 'Talents' or wealth. The mightiest of all nobility make up the Empress's Court, forever engaged in their games of court intrigue and war. The Six Greater Houses dominate all aspects of life in the realm, ensuring that imperial law is upheld in all accounts.\n\nIt is rare for a lowborn to possess a Talent, especially the kind wielded by yourself in your flagrant display. Fortunately for you, Ausar of House Renault, twelfth in line to the Ivory Throne, was not inclined to waste such a *valuable* individual. Even at the tender age of 22, the Talent to bend the flames to his will commanded a somewhat fearful respect from lesser nobility, let alone the common folk. \n\nThe aristocrat peers down at you with a parochial expression, a small smile offsetting a glint in his eye that conveyed far more than mere interest. \"You can either be put down like some common cur, or take your place by my side. Come now, let's not be rash. There is nothing but death left for you here. Ah, I see that look in your eye; your white knuckles and stony expression. I dare say you might even be contemplating murdering me. But you won't. Everything you are, everything you will become, is by my hand. You will never betray me.\"  He pauses to extend a regal hand, a faint whiff of burnt wood lingering under your nose as he gently grasps your bruised jaw. \"And in time, I suspect, you may not even want to.\" \n\n\"Go on, take my hand. I do not like to be kept waiting.\" \n\n\n_____________\n\nCongrats on making it thus far! Reposting this here again since I\u2019m aiming for a less carnally-focused story than what I\u2019m used to. I'm looking to write a tale of court intrigue with a possible smattering of adventure for good measure. A wee bit of worldbuilding will be required as well, so for those who enjoy such things don't hesitate to send off that orange envelope. I used to have a considerable amount of background notes available upon request, but I\u2019ve since found that worldbuilding is best enjoyed when done with a mutual amount of effort involved.\n\nThe RP itself takes place in a steampunkish kind of world (think a similar setting to Dishonoured) where the ruling elite of society are born with unique abilities colloquially referred to as 'Talents.' As a lowborn of exceptional power, your character is an exceedingly rare and potentially invaluable individual. In your response, please include the backstory of your character, including their Talent and the nature of their crime which has placed them squarely at the mercy of Ausar. The one restriction I ask of you is to keep your character from being overpowered! \n\nThe prompt is open-ended, meaning that your character is of course in no way obliged to embrace whatever plans Ausar might have for them. I\u2019d welcome a tale of rebellion and double-crossing as much as I would begrudging service.  Equally, if you like the thought of playing as another character (such as another aristocrat) then feel more than free to pitch your suggestion. We\u2019ll be worldbuilding this together so I\u2019m eager to see how you might want to take this! I\u2019ll keep it short and sweet so please, if you have questions (to be frank, I\u2019m hoping you do!) then ask away. If you\u2019d like a further look at the quality of my writing, I\u2019d recommend having a glance through my post history. Cheerio.",

I come from a decade long background of writing and role playing, so I\u2019m experienced but a little set in my ways. \n\nAbout me: \n* I\u2019m 29 years old so I would love to find a partner 21 or older \n* I write in third person and would like a partner that does as well\n* I use face-claims (pictures of real people to portray characters) and I hope you will as well. Bonus if you like using pictures for outfits or settings. \n* I can write anywhere from 3 to 6 paragraphs depending on the scene, if the two characters are interacting, and if my partner has given me enough to work with. \n* I for one, love a little smut. I don\u2019t want a story that revolves around it and I like it to be natural progression, but I\u2019d like to have that in there. We can talk about limits and what not, of course. \n* I also love to get to know my partner outside of our writing. Becoming friends makes writing together so much better in my opinion so I hope you\u2019re open to that! \n\nSo if you\u2019re still here and excited, I\u2019m so happy! I\u2019m looking to write a modern urban fantasy romance or a slice of life romance. I love everything fantasy, especially a hidden magical world thriving just beneath the surface of the every day mundane world. I\u2019m also all for slice of life romance so long as we have life like characters with life like drama. I don\u2019t have any plots thought up as of now, but I\u2019d love to plot with you! \n\nAs for pairings, I\u2019m open to mxf, mxm, fxf. I\u2019m always feeling a queer pairing but I\u2019m up for whatever and wiling to play male or female.  \n\nSo I hope to find the partner I\u2019m looking for, chat soon!",

See, in this universe the gods rule the mortal realms and are worshipped in some capacity by even smaller nations. You have your Sky Gods, your Water Gods, Your Agricultural Gods...and every god has a place in this universe in the hierarchy. See, the Elder Gods maintain order and chaos at the tippy top and rule over the major elements of life as we know it. Their powers are almost unmatched by any known beings in the multiverse, their footsteps straddling mountain ranges and their fury sundering continents. Taking shape as dragons and primordial serpents, great ghastly clouds of death or radiant beings of purity....and then there is me..\n\nSee i'm what you might refer to as a 'niche' goddess. In a universe where you can be the god of wheat or the god of tin or the goddess of blind monks I was saddled with the Goddess of Rubber. Born to a fertility goddess and a Brewing god (Dad was always a smooth talking dork), I was gifted the ability to stretch....well...forever! As the chief messenger to the Gods and the apprentice to the God of Merymaking im the life of the party! Ever seen a woman dance with no bones in her body? Ever tried outchugging a team of dwarven brewmeisters? You ever outraced a zephyr up a mountain in one step!? Or stretched across an desert for funsies!?!?! I sure can and its awesome! Of course the fun stops there. I was always ostracized for being a revelry goddess and branded as unladylike by the more uptight goddesses. Suffice to say I may have said some unchoice words to the King of Gods about how he treated humanity and well...now im here on the mortal plane! Do you know what its like to bounce across three planes of existence...? And well... I really need help getting back home...\n\n____\n\nHello everyone, Tilith is an odd goddess and needs a mortal champion(ess) to help he return home. Thanks to her outbursts (potentially spurred by alcohol and a few opiates) in the halls of heaven she has landed smack dab on the mortal plane and cant return till she's undertaken a sufficient number of challenges to restore her honor. Despite her mindboggling elasticity she is neither a great fighter nor one to hold her tongue and needs a little help keeping herself in check. Who knows what adventures await in this wide world for her and her new companion!\n\nFor this project im envisioning a long-term, co-op build universe where the Gods exist in all facets of life and the realm of mortals is akin to a never ending game of DnD. Long, slow burns await and choices made will affect whether Tilith rises to restore her honor or even challenges the way the Gods run the show! I want to discuss every detail from your character's motives and looks to the nations and kingdoms that span this universe. Will we meet other gods, heroes, and rising legends? Will we run amok in the underworld of society? Romance is most certainly attainable for those who click with Tilith's kind if not often misguided heart and potentially much more if you can woo her~  Are you a young farmer seeking new adventures or maybe a squire on a journey to be a knight? A dashing rouge? An Orc chief? A wise inventor or even a legend yourself?\n\n18+ only, sorry kids! Kudos to those with fun character ideas up front! :D 2-4 paragraphs would be nice per response, 1 minimum please! \nAdventure awaits, stories to be told, and alcohol to be consumed by the keg! Help this little Goddess get home!",

Her eyelids closing every so often to relieve her of any worries as she was back to her reality. Though it did little to nothing when realization hit as it was her coronation day.\n\nAll her sisters went through with this day. Meeting what their parents\u2019 confirmed what was a suitable suitor for the girls. Princes\u2019 that would strengthen and aid their elf kingdom. What kingdom wouldn\u2019t want to bind theirs being the eldest kingdom of elves? Her family long ago cursed to only have females be born royalty meaning never a male heir. Thus every female elf was enforced to be wedded once the ripe age of eighteen and even with Zara being the tenth daughter it was no reason she couldn\u2019t be married off too. \n\nShe removed herself from bed, ushering away from the handmaiden that tried to ease Zara out her sweat soaked nightgown. Choosing to aid herself as always to cleaning of her own body. She refused to be as meek as her older sisters, having spoke out at the counsel and her own parents of this day, but nonetheless it was futile as it was what they considered her \u201cdestiny.\u201d All these thoughts of her past ran through her head as she cleansed herself of her nightmare. Letting the bath that was drawn for her, soak into her skin, now smelling of jasmine.\n\nShe let the handmaidens dress her in the appropriate white dress and painting on her face to remind elves of their ancestors beginning in the forest as weaklings of the many creatures. Now nearly eons later they were on the top with others, catching up. She kept the handmaidens from adding any extra form of symbolics, wanting to be simple as this wasn\u2019t something she wanted to stick out at. \n\nShe sighed heavily as she ignored the voices around her gossiping about the rest of her sisters returning to see the last of Demesti\u2019s be wedded off, or who her suitor was, she had heard enough absurd choices from as far as a human prince to a rival ogre kingdom. Settling in outside the ballroom where the royalties awaited for her grand entrance. She didn\u2019t want anything large, having her parents forbid it to be open to the public like others, only permitting her family, the counsel and whomever the suitor brought along. She looked at the male servants as they awaited her nod to open the doors. Her green eyes glued to the closed doors as she could hear muffled discussions going on....\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n.This is a role play idea that I just started typing and went along with it. More than open to whatever character you\u2019d like to play out. Perhaps you\u2019re my suitor who is a creature. A elf, witch, vampire, ogre, or whatever you think is what you\u2019d like to play. Say you\u2019re none and want to break my character way from her destiny. I\u2019d like that too. Anyways, I think this would be fun to play out, please message me if you want to pursue this journey.",

The island nation of Savala, and controller of the Zaviti ocean, and just on the shore was its capitol that was Yitol, and its mighty vessels that you had seen patrolling the waves, the aqua blue and green sails flapping in the wing emblazoned with the seal of the kingdom, a trident with a ring hanging off the left prong.\n\nSoon enough you dock in the royal port with the castle overlooking the boat you're on, giving a stunning view of the stone brick castle, some parts of it looking newer than the others as they were destroyed at one point by cannon fire. This was a young nation after all, and had seen their fair amount of strife in their was against Yilise for liberation. On the dock though is a waiting party of six people. Two guards in scaled plate armor, a hooded man that served as the court mage, the king and queen, and the prince. All 6 of them sporting the royal colors of the nation.\n\nThe prince in question looked like a younger version of the graying king that welcomed them warmly. He stood at a healthy 6 foot 2 inches but stood more silent but still with a rather friendly smile, his tanned skin contrasted his bright blue eyes and raven hair. His bare shoulder had the seal of the kingdom tattooed onto it, his dress that being of the royal fishermen. A simple vest and pants along with knee high boots.\n\nThe kingdom was in troubled times again, and the kingdom had come under hard times. They were seeking help from from other kingdoms. To form alliances. Treaties. That's why you had come. Wherever you had come from. The forests of Tyradil, the sands of Rulov, or another far off nation from a far off land. Whether you be human, Orc, Elf, goblin or gnome.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo! Howdy, I'm looking for someone to play against the prince if the 7 seas. I'm a role player with a good 5 years under my belt at this point rping all kinds of things. I have a job and college classes though so I wont be able to be on all the time 24/7 as I need to sleep eat study and work but I will try and get in one response a day at the very least and if not I'll let you know. So if you're still interested I primarily use discord and reddit messages so if you want to RP this, go ahead and DM me, as long as this is up I'll be accepting.",

            "selftext": " \n\nEveryone knows about the X-Men or something of a similar nature. People gifted with incredible powers due to a defect in their genes. Well, it turns out that truth, like in many cases, is far stranger than fiction. Not only do these genes exist, but most people have them. People go every day with these genes and never activate them. Of course, they're not like we see in the comics and movies, they don't activate when most convenient in order to save the hero\u2019s life. If that were the case, thousands if not millions of people would have been saved by their own genetics. No, these genes have to be activated through advanced medical procedures, only recently discovered and costing nearly millions just for one patient. All of this information was, and still is, kept under wraps since the \u201960s. After the first discovery of the gene, the original carrier was promptly examined, a human guinea pig if you will. Soon, another person was taken, then another, then another. Most, if not all of those studied contained a very similar gene that didn\u2019t seem to correlate to what we knew before like hair color or things of that nature. They were far more. Ever since then, a group of scientists known solely as The Organization worked tirelessly to find out just how to unlock the true potential behind this gene and bring forth the next step in human evolution. The organization works directly with the U.S government as an off the books group sworn to secrecy.\n\nAfter a very tightly monitored and rough selection process, they\u2019ve agreed to give up their lives in order to treat and care for these mutants, abandoning friends and family alike. This group has basically destroyed all trace of themselves, even managing to drop off the grid entirely, in order to pursue these scientific endeavors. Their goal is to advance human genetics, to create something better than a standard human. At the same time, they also wish to record the results of such endeavors, how the subjects respond to their new changes, what they\u2019re capable of. The endgame planned for these mutants is up in the air, no one truly knowing what the facility plans to use them for should these tests be a resounding success.\n\nWill you be the next subject? Or, will you stand by the facility and work tirelessly to advance mankind to its fullest potential? If interested, feel free to check out the server [here!](https://discord.gg/dcPwBRY) and see just what fun you can get into!",

            "selftext": "Hi, hi! I got a few really awesome people reply to my last post, and that made me happy! Some honestly fun roleplays started, but I want to re-post for possibly two more people. The perfect amount of people responded, but two weren't able to rp with me for reasons, so I think I'd like to see if anyone wants to fill those spots? I'd be fine if not, but I thought I'd try. \n\n**I'd like to point out, though, one common thing concerning people is the word-count.**  Not a lot of people write that much anymore, which is fine, I do understand. I'm not going to ghost you because you didn't hit 600, I just feel like I want to be honest that if I *do* stop replying, lack of detail would be why, because it makes it harder for me to respond if I don't have much to work with. \n\nRe-posting the last thing I wrote instead of re-writing it:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHey, guys! I'm looking for a long term roleplay partner. I'm 26 years old and I've been roleplaying for 13 years.  I'm looking for someone close to my age, but at least over 20, since the most fun rps have mature themes. When I have a favorite rp partner, I stick to them for months to years--only a falling out in friendship stops the story.\n\nAbout me:\n\n* I've either done the thing or seen the thing done, so pretty much nothing in rp bothers me.  Bring on the suggestive and the gory!\n* I am an impulsive writer, I don't make my characters do things, I write what they want to do--so detail planning things is wasted effort because 50/50 chance they will sabotage all plans. On the bright side, it makes them more realistic.\n* I prefer making male characters since that's what I'm used to, but I can make female characters if I'm properly inspired. I also *prefer* m/m, but I'm okay with m/f for side characters. I have never done f/f before so I have no opinion on it.\n* I can make characters so fast it's almost embarrassing. The more characters in an rp, the better!\n* I write multi-para to novella (1.5k to 3k+ words). The more inspired I am, the more I write--but I write less than 1k (0.7 - 0.8) if there is nothing going on. I will not respond if I'm bored. If I'm bored and I don't expect to get over it, I'll let you know. I am okay with my rp partner not mirroring me, but if you write less than 600 words I will get bored fast, no matter how great your writing is.\n* I write in 3rd person attached, with multiple POVs separated if I have more than one character in a scene and their POV is important/relevant.\n* Genres: fantasy (including modern), supernatural, romance, slice of life/family (in moderation), action (**not** sparring), adventure, sci-fi, world building, apocalyptic, post-apocalyptic, and horror (sometimes)\n* Super duper extremely literate! Jk, I make mistakes and don't proof read sometimes, but I have been in the game long enough to know what I'm doing and be somewhat picky about what I receive.\n* I only use OCs, I *do not* Fandom RP and I *will not* Fandom RP.\n* I prefer email but I guess everyone likes discord so I'll do that too.\n* I respond daily, often multiple times a day, and I will tell you if I can't respond on one day (like if I have a date or something idk.).\n* None of my characters are human. I **hate** making human characters, I will not do it! Some of my characters are OP (because of stuff and things in the RL past), if rping with them happens, fighting them is not allowed because that's kinda not fair. I hate sparring period, but still.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat I'm looking for in you!:\n\n* 20+, and okay with **super** mature themes. (Like, seriously, if you have triggers I'm probably not a good fit, because some things that can trigger people at the very least will be mentioned if it's part of a character's backstory. I don't wanna do that to you.)\n* Have a firm grasp on grammar, and able to write more than 600 words. (&lt;--Looking for, but I won't fight you if you can't! There's just a giant giant disclaimer that I may not be able to continue the rp.)\n* Able to juggle more than one character. (I'm sorry, but you're going to get overwhelmed if you have one character and I have, like five. Also, I've done this imbalanced thing before and it's also really boring for me... No one watches tv or reads a book with only one character present the entire time, you know?)\n* I'd love it if you preferred m/m, **but it's not mandatory**. You have to definitely be comfortable with it.\n* Able to respond daily. Matching how frequently I respond is preferred but you don't have to!\n* Have a healthy (or unhealthy, who am I to judge) obsession with shipping like me.\n* Able to write in 3rd person and juggle multiple povs.\n* Be a really cool person!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do not have \"rl\" faceclaims... I like to draw, so if I want to see my character I'll draw them. But I was a weeb, so my style is pretty anime-ish, apparently some people don't like that? I'm not really interested in changing that about me. Sometimes I'll go on a search if there's a specific outfit I can't describe properly, but that's it. Idc if you use rl people as faceclaims, I just won't want to do it.\n\nPlease don't message me questioning why I haven't done f/f.... people did that last time. :(\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIF YOU READ ALL OF THIS THANK YOU! GO OUT AND BUY YOURSELF A COOKIE, YOU EARNED IT!",

            "selftext": "Hello all! My name is E, I'm 20, from the EST, and I'm looking for someone with ~~a particular set of skills~~ the ability to become a long-term partner and friend of mine as we build a multitude of worlds to thrust our pairing of characters into! This would be over Discord since it's an amazing platform with the ability to get a numerous amount of plots and threads going at once, it makes everything neater in the long run! The themes would range from slice of life sweetness to cyberpunk futuristic crime grittiness, and everything in between. Mature themes WILL be present, so I do ask that my partners are over the age of 18, preferably 20 and up. Now that the first disclaimers are outta the way, we can focus on a little more detailed rules, what I'm looking for in terms of content/plots, fandoms i'm into, and anything else I can remember to put in here, lol.\n\nRULES:\n\n* Please be over the age of 18, preferably over 20.\n* Have a Discord, if you're not familiar with it, no worries, I can walk you through and also provide a server once we get started!\n* Be okay with mature themes, this ranges from smut to violent combat scenes, I want our roleplays to contain realistic and gritty aspects, so they won't always be for the light of heart.\n* Contribute ideas and content to further the plot. I want a partner who can put in their ideas as well as allow me to put mine in. A symbiotic relationship is what I'm ultimately after.\n* When it comes to post length, as long as it's over two paragraphs, I'm okay! I don't want one-liners, and although I do love a novella reply, they aren't necessary for every aspect of the roleplay. Too much or too little burns me out quite fast and unfortunately makes me lose muse as well. In addition, I do ask that you also respond in 3rd POV, as I reply in 3rd POV past tense.\n* Although grammar and punctuation are a big part of what I require, capitalization is a bit of a lee-way for me. My replies are never capitalized, though I do ask you be consistent. Either capitalize properly or don't use caps at all, but flip flopping is a giant peeve for me.\n* Either play both males and females or just males. I would love to have some m/m, f/f and m/f plots equally peppered through our different threads, BUT it isn't a requirement! I also ask that you provide a faceclaim, nothing anime or drawn, only real life faces, please. It helps the creative process!\n* Have fun! That's an order, lol.\n\nI know that was a LOT, but I do hope you've continued to stick around for the fun stuff below, aka plots! They're just ideas or pairings that we can expand on in depth in private. Any and all pairings can be made for these as well, any and all characters will be portrayed as 18 and over; bolded are what I prefer to play. If both are bolded, I don't mind playing either!\n\nPLOTS/PAIRINGS:\n\n* **Rogue cyborg** \\+ C**yborg police officer / Human cyborg hunter**\n* **New town comer** \\+ Token rebel / Nerdy loner\n* **Sweet teacher** \\+ Business worker parent\n* **Student** \\+ Teacher\n* **Offspring's friend** \\+ Parent\n* **Alien escaping persecution** \\+ Retired police official\n* **Ghoul** \\+ H**uman / Other supernatural being**\n* **Concubine / Consort** \\+ Royal official\n* **Soft ballet dancer** \\+ Stern music major\n* **Retired / Newbie gangster** \\+ Grizzly detective\n\nI do have more than that, but for the sake of this post already being long as all heck as well as those being what I currently crave the most, we can discuss further in PM if necessary! Now what comes next is fandoms that I'm into as well as canon characters I am interested in playing. I would prefer they stay Canon x Canon, but if we both really want an OC to be played, I don't mind doing a Canon x OC plot!\n\nFANDOMS:\n\n* Marvel\n   * Riri Williams \\[Ironheart\\]\n   * Carol Danvers \\[Captain Marvel\\]\n   * Wanda Maximoff \\[Scarlet Witch\\]\n   * Neena Thurman \\[Domino\\]\n   * Jean Grey \\[Phoenix\\]\n   * Peter Parker \\[Spiderman\\]\n   * Michelle Jones \\[MJ\\]\n   * Shuri Udaku\n   * Miles Morales \\[Spiderman\\]\n* DC\n   * Rachel Roth \\[Raven\\]\n   * Karen Beecher-Duncan \\[Bumblebee\\]\n   * Koriand'r \\[Starfire\\]\n* Steven Universe\n   * Pink Diamond\n   * Connie Maheswaran\n* Twilight\n   * Bella Swan\n   * Leah Clearwater\n   * Jane\n   * Benjamin\n* Stranger Things\n   * Robin Buckley\n   * Jane 'Eleven' Hopper\n   * Maxine Mayfield\n   * Jonathan Byers\n   * Steve Harrington\n\nAfter all of this extensive word vomit, I hope I've kept the attention of amazing people who are definitely interested in roleplaying with me to create these amazing worlds for us! If you're still interested, please message me your name, age, timezone and which pairings or canon characters you were interested in doing. I hope to meet awesome people who won't mind making an equally awesome ~~(I hope)~~ partner!\n\nHappy writing!",

            "selftext": "Hi there. So you may be wondering how I got here? Well, lemme tell ya\u2014\n\nGreetings guys, gals, and non-binary pals! (If anyone gets that reference, I will love you forever). I\u2019m glad you found this message! This is my first time posting, so hopefully it\u2019s not too long.\n\nAnyways, I am a nineteen year old female on PST time (I am posting this at two in the morning, I don\u2019t need to sleep) with six years of roleplay experience. I consider myself to be a third-person, literate roleplayer, meaning that I can write out between 200 and 400 words per response. Sometimes my responses can be much longer than that depending on what\u2019s happening in the roleplay, but that just my average response. As of right now, I\u2019m looking to find a partner to do an original roleplay with (sorry to anyone looking for fandom roleplays).\n\n\nHere are some basic requirements:\n\n1. **You must be 18 or older.** Simple and to the point.\n\n2. **You must have good grammar and be able to write a decent amount.** It doesn\u2019t need to be perfect, since spelling errors are inevitable, but just do the best that you can. Also, you don\u2019t need to be able to write me an essay, but don\u2019t send me one or two-liners either. In short, show me that you put in effort into your response.\n\n3. **You must be able to reply at least once every other day.** I understand that sometimes life can get busy, even when you don\u2019t expect it, but I\u2019d like to be notified if and when something like that happens. (If I don\u2019t happen to respond in that timespan, I most likely just forgot about it or got distracted halfway through my reply, so feel free to remind me if I haven\u2019t responded.)\n\n4. I do have a fair number of plots and concepts, but **don\u2019t come to me without any ideas of your own.** Even if it\u2019s just a character that you\u2019ve been really wanting to try out, we can find a way to create a plot where you can use them. I don\u2019t want to be the only one doing the heavy lifting.\n\n5. Continuing off the previous one, **have an interesting and complex character.** Don\u2019t make them one-dimensional. If your character doesn\u2019t have any personality, it ruins the experience.\n\n6. **Please don\u2019t ghost me.** I know sometimes it can be an easy way out for people, hence why it happens so often, but if you\u2019re no longer enjoying the roleplay, please let me know. I want us to both enjoy roleplaying together. Communication is key.\n\n7. **Out-of-character chatting.** This is less so a requirement and more of just a hope. It\u2019s nice just to get to talk to someone sometimes, even if it\u2019s about the randomest (autocorrect says that\u2019s not a word but I disagree) things. It\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t want to, but I just think it\u2019ll be more fun and make the roleplay even more enjoyable.\n\n8. **I only roleplay on Discord**, so unfortunately if you don\u2019t have it, we won\u2019t be able to roleplay.\n\n\nIf you happen to meet all those requirements, here\u2019s what I\u2019m interested in (not necessarily in order):\n\n* **Romance** - ~~Can you feel the love tonight?~~ Preferably M x M, but M x F (with me as the female) and F x F is fine too. (Only for the character. Your IRL gender can be anything at all!) It doesn\u2019t have to be NSFW unless you\u2019re okay with that.\n\n* **Angst** - Sometimes, I just like to cry.\n\n* **Fantasy** - Could be high or low fantasy, medieval or modern, you name it. I love all things involving magical and mystical creatures and beings!\n\n* **Sci-fi** - I like stuff that involves aliens and space travel. There are endless possibilities!\n\n* **Dark themes** - As fun as it is to just float near the surface with the sun shining down, sometimes diving deeper into the depths of the sea where the sun can no longer reach is much more fascinating.\n\n* **Action** - It can provide plenty of conflict and challenges for our characters to overcome, learn, and grow.\n\n* **Modern** - I don\u2019t usually do modern roleplays, but I have done a few in the past that I really enjoyed. If you have a good plot idea for it, lemme know!\n\n\nNow, if you read all that, congrats! Have a virtual cookie. If you\u2019re interested in roleplaying with me, send me a message telling me about yourself and what you\u2019re looking to roleplay. Send me the phrase \u201cI can/cannot do a backflip\u201d (depends on whether you actually can or can\u2019t, I\u2019m just curious) so that I know that your read this whole thing.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you!",

            "selftext": "\n\nHello all! I\u2019ll start off by saying that I don\u2019t usually post much, or anything really. So this might come out a little bit stiff and ever so slightly messy mainly because for the last while I\u2019ve been knocking myself silly trying to gain the courage to post and get into this again.\n\n\nGetting started then, I\u2019ve been roleplaying for quite a long time now and managed to pack around 5 years in total under my little belt. (If I hadn\u2019t taken the two year hiatus it most likely would\u2019ve been seven but what can you do?) Since I\u2019ve returned to Reddit I\u2019ve scrolled through the various posts and marvelled at the creativity and passion of the writers but never reached out to any of them. Thankfully I\u2019ve found a time in my life were I can squeeze this in again and I couldn\u2019t be happier to do so.\n\n\nMy favourite genres to write are the following; Fantasy, Medieval, Historical, Slice of Life, Modern and Romance. I know it\u2019s pretty much cookie-cutter but I\u2019ve never had that much experience of being able to write genres like mystery, horror or sci-fi. I\u2019ll leave those genres to the amazing writers who can craft a story with them so well! (Props to you guys, some stories I\u2019ve read snippets of are so well done and intriguing!) \n\nI\u2019m usually quite active and love to write long replies fluttered with the details but I get that some people like quick, short replies to keep the story moving on a little quicker which is perfectly fine! If anything comes up or if I have something planned I\u2019ll always do my best to tell the lovely person I\u2019m writing with in advance as I think we\u2019ve all experienced that quick fellow who pops out for a carton of milk and doesn\u2019t ever come back. (Seriously, where do they all go? Do the ghosts have people to spook?) \n\nSince this post is getting quite long now I\u2019ll just leave a few little important details here;\n\n* If you\u2019re interested please DM me, I would love to work something out! (I mainly write on Discord.)\n\n* I work Part-Time at a little store on the weekends and attend college three days during the week.\n\n* If we do get past the DM-Stage and move onto Roleplay, if you have any problems at all with me please just mention it. I won\u2019t get angry or upset, if we have a problem I\u2019d love to sort it out ASAP.\n\n* I won\u2019t write as any characters from any fandom, sorry. No matter how much I love a show I don\u2019t believe I could write the character confidently enough, I apologise for the inconvenience.\n\n* I will not Roleplay with anyone under the age of eighteen, I\u2019m sorry if this disappoints anyone in particular.\n\nI hope to hear from someone soon, have a lovely day! ^^",

This is my first time reaching out to reddit in regards, but I'm not new to Roleplay, I have about 5+ years of doing so. I can rp any type, script, paragraphs, whatever anyone is comfortable with. I love slices of life, action, drama, but most of all, an engaging story. I'm also a DM for a couple of dungeons and dragons campaigns so I have no issue with making a story and working with a potential partner, as long as you add some context to the story!

I am currently in the market for a new RP partner that is into some male on male fun as I have an abundance of free time and most of my old partners have fizzled out. I typically Rp on discord.\n\nI am a pretty laid back guy. I am not expecting to Rp every day and I understand that life happens. Really as long as we are both still having fun I am normally content regardless of pace. Typically my biggest thing is a mixture of story and smut.\n\nAs far as post length goes I enjoy slightly longer posts a couple of paragraphs but more or less can be done depending on what is going on. No one needs a three page description of a side characters dress that we will never see again.\n\nAs far as setting is concerned I am pretty versatile. I do tend to enjoy: modern fantasy, high fantasy, low fantasy, dark settings, politics, and futuristic setting. Really you name it if I can be creative I am normally down.\n\nI don\u2019t really have set character preferences myself. I do tend to play my guys as more versatile in general as it opens up more possibilities but I am not wedded to anything in particular.\n\nI have several RP ideas that I am working on but I always love to workshop these kinds of things prior to our start. I don\u2019t want this to be only my show, I love it when both partners can get excited about an rp.\n\nFeel free to message me if you think we can work something out.",

It involves a husband and wife where she is a soldier/police officer/criminal and he does not like it. The roleplay itself involves lots of banter, arguing, dialogue, and hopefully some character development. I can go into more detail in private but, honestly, I prefer to come up with something we can play together.

            "selftext": "Hello!\u00a0 I'm Doe and I'm looking for partners that are at least 21+ as that's my\u00a0 age range. I write multiple paragraphs/novella style (200-500+ words). I\u00a0 love to write detailed descriptions and delve into a character\u2019s\u00a0 head/emotions as well as surroundings. I compare it to writing a novel\u00a0 together.\n\nI understand if the scene\u00a0 doesn\u2019t have alot going on and therefore requires less. I adore having\u00a0 long, thoughtful replies where we truly immerse ourselves in the world.\u00a0 I'm hoping to find a partner whose as enthusiastic about the plot and\u00a0 writing as I am. When I get invested in a story, it\u2019s 100% dedication.\u00a0 Getting a reply is the highlight of my day.\n\nI'm\u00a0 a big fan of romance and using face claims. I\u2019m the type to make\u00a0 pinterest boards, spam you with gifs, headcanons, and send you songs\u00a0 that remind me of our characters and/or ship. \n\nLast but not least I only do MxF (with myself in the female role and you in the male). I don\u2019t double, but I\u2019m more than happy to write side characters of either gender to help move the story along. \n\nI'd highly prefer female authors writing male characters as I've had too many bad encounters with male writers and at this point I'm uncomfortable with it. Sorry guys!\n\nDesperately Searching For:\n\n* 21+ partners\n* For you to have an excellent grasp of grammar, punctuation, spelling, and capitalization. Both in character and **out of character.** (Literate to advanced writers only, please. I'm not looking for newbies or those who English isn't their first language).\n* The\u00a0 more description, the better! I'm looking for someone can write as much\u00a0 as me (2 to 4 paragraphs or more) and really bring the story to life. I\u00a0 lose interest if I'm the only one that's invested/enthusiastic or\u00a0 coming up with plot ideas. Quality writing makes my heart happy, as does\u00a0 world building together.\n* The\u00a0 use of real life face claims and joining me in the wonderful world of\u00a0 ship/character development isn't a requirement but I'd sure be delighted\u00a0 if we were on the same page in this regard. (I won't use anime faces,\u00a0 only art if you're uncomfortable with real life)\n* I'm looking for the long term here, and I hope you will be too. I've had stories going for months. \n\nIf\u00a0 you've made it this far, thank you! You won't be disappointed in\u00a0 writing with me. \n\nOriginal Genres:\n\n* Mafia/Crime\n* Post Apocalyptic/Dystopia\n* Supernatural/Modern Fantasy\n* Southern/Mid-Western/Urban Gothic\n* Modern Mythology/Fairytale Retellings\n* Sci-fi\n* Cyberpunk/Retro-Futuristic\n* Superpowers/Gifted\n\nAll my characters will be adults and I require my partners to do the same. For plot and more genre ideas, please message me \\^ I prefer to write over email but use discord for chatting and writing, along with google docs.\n\nPlease\u00a0 be detailed when you message me, let me know why you chose to contact\u00a0 me. Seeing \"hey do you wanna rp?\" is a guaranteed way to turn me off.\n\nLook forward to hearing from you!",

            "selftext": "So I\u2019m looking for anyone who\u2019s interested in role playing a story which involves a crew on a ship. I have not decided if it will be a small crew on a small ship, or a huge vessel with our characters being the focus. The idea of the Roleplay is that there is periods of action, where the ship is potentially on a military mission or is delivering cargo and gets held up by pirates etc., offset by periods of character building and potentially tension or romance within the crew, as they are people trapped in a ship, thus these things are inevitable. The idea is inspired by the expanse series and other sci fi stories.\n\nI have no OCs in mind but if you have some please use them! The world outside the ship could be one of turmoil, racism and violence, or one of growth and prosperity; we may not even need to know! I\u2019m very open with his concept, and I want to keep it that way so you can pick an idea that you think would be fun based off of the concept. I\u2019m open to characters of any race and gender, so if you wanted to go alien that\u2019s fine by me! I don\u2019t mind playing any role myself but prefer male.\n\nI thought this would work well as a long term Roleplay, and I do like longer replies, but it\u2019s okay if not. I prefer to use discord but have access to other methods. Message me if you\u2019re at all interested, or have a cool idea based on this idea that you think might be fun!",

Anyway, I'm here to invite anyone who likes the internet show RWBY, or role playing in general, which being a role play group I'd hope that there were RPers here, to join this group. This group has been around for about 5 years more or less and is great fun, and the moderators and owner are really great and helpful people. There is quite a bit of rules to go through so as to make the experience fun for all but it's worth it. You do not really have to know anything about the RWBY show or manga to join this group because none of that really matters for the most part. So you can hop on in there with no worries of having to sit through like 6 seasons of a show. So I hope some of you join and have fun! (P.S. Dunno what Flair to use so I'll just put down groups if that's ok).",

            "selftext": "Evening lads!\n\n\n I'm a semi-experienced female roleplayer (2 years) looking for a partner to do a superhuman roleplay. Now, I may not respond to requests very early, since college is time consuming, but trust I will have time in a good day or two. \n\nThings about me;\n\n\u2022I'm 20 years old\n\u2022I am in college at the moment\n\u2022I am completely okay with OCC chat, and encourage it!\n\nI am alright with any gender playing a male character/a masculine character with either male features or a more masculine personality of it comes to romance. However, any gender of any kind and any personality can play as anything if the roleplay remains friendship based.\n\nI plan on leaving out details like location, specific powers, and other vital things because I would like to make a setting that me and my partner can adjust to and develop! Though, I have a pretty normal set of guidelines!\n\nThis story will follow characters, maybe in college or something (up to you), developing a slightly unstable power. I know how my character will have devolved their power, but your character can be pretty free with how they develop their power!\n\n\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\nI will say that I do have a slight limit to how much power someone can have/how they use it. You can have offspring abilities that relate to your main ability.\nHowever, if you choose to have a mage character, or a more powerful character that has many abilities, these rules can be bent. \nFor example;\n\nPeople who have abilities that are strictly invisibility, lava, water, earth, weather, mind manipulation, time manipulation, portal travel, ect; then your offspring ability must relate to that.\nEx. Being invisible and turning other things invisible, being a lava based character and controlling all hot things/summoning hot things, being water based and turning stuff into water, ect. Get creative and see what you can do!\n\n\nHowever, if you have a character who controls multiple aspects of elements, reality, or is just a plain mage, you will be limited to 12 starting abilities. It's a lot, but quite little. Your abilities don't have to relate to your main ability, because You don't have one. \n\nYou must upfront tell me what your abilities are. If you want to add more through the story, that's fine! But do it in a way that shows how your character is changing and developing more powers rather than just saying \"Oh! I forgot to mention blah blah blah this power!\" . \n\nNow, you may play in any role you so choose! If you're not into romance then you can pick a role like friend, or sibling! You could start off with my character being a stranger or already knowing them!\n\nRomance is completely welcome too, and while I'm not much of a fan of NSFW roleplay : if events turn that way then it is more than welcome because it relates to the story.\n\nYou are totally okay to be a villain! Or a hero too, either works. The rest can be discussed in Reddit pm.\n\nI personally use;\n\n\u2022Twitter\n\u2022Discord\nor..\n\u2022Reddit!\n\n\nI'm giving you space to move around and feel comfortable doing just about anything with this idea! Anything can be discussed, and all boundaries will be respected. Feel free to message me about any questions or if you're interested.\n\nI will be awaiting your text!",

            "selftext": "Humanity is...odd. They never stop pushing. Never lay down and die. When the swarm stormed their home world, seeking to raze it like any others, the human race persevered. They took the technology from the hive race, and weaponized it. By the stars, they managed to turn gravity into a weapon, making small holes in space, to tear through any and all hostile ships that'd come close.\n\nEven as the swarm killed more and more of them off, they stubbornly resisted. They learned how to manipulate hyperspace technology, just by tearing what they could out of destroyed swarm ships. Even as their planet burned, they persevered.\n\nEven after countless years of a seemingly endless war, after countless holes in space, they kept fighting. They learned how to manipulate the swarm.\n\nThey learned how to make them kill themselves.\n\nHumanity, in a last ditch effort, built a giant relay, mimicking the distress call of a swarm queen. That call, drove ship after ship to their deaths, until the race had, essentially, killed itself.\n\nBefore this inevitable extinction, however, humanity built one last ship. One last way off their ruined planet. The force of that ship ripping through hyperspace was what ended up cracking their homeworld, leaving it empty, and barren.\n\nOnce word spread about the heroic race, countless civilizations offered them new homes. Moons, asteroid belts, entire planets, for humanity to start anew on.\n\nBut each and every time, they declined. Instead, they asked for ships to ferry their race across the cosmos. They wandered, for years, after years. Of course, anywhere they ended up with a intelligent race, they were welcome.\n\nThey offered technology and goods, in exchange for information. Always information. Maps. Star charts, scans of solar systems. Even rumors.\n\nMost would ask what they searched so desperately for, instead of finding a place to settle. The leaders would simply answer \"what remains of home. Our Ark.\"\n\n)(\n\nHelllllo, everyone! This is my current pride and joy, my blurb that I hope will become a spacefaring epic. But, before I go into that, you should know something about me. I'm a 20 something male, with plenty of writing experience. I enjoy a bit of romance in my stories, but it's not exactly required. Action and mystery are welcome, as well. NSFW themes are just fine with me, in mild doses. As for my writing style, I write in third person, past tense, with about 1-3 paragraphs per response. \n\nWith all of that out of the way, I hope you enjoyed my prompt! Please, by all means, shoot me a message, and we can discuss any questions you have! But please, introduce yourself! I dislike having to find a way to reply to \"hey I was interested in your prompt\" messages. Anywho, I think that's all from me. Hope to see those messages!",

We plan to add some creatures and cryptids inspired by Mexican and Native American folklore as well.\n\n\u2606 New plants and consumables, including mesquite beans, peyote, radscorpion tequila, and Thatsaburger patties (our Whataburger knockoff).\n\n\u2606 Several pre-made locations to explore with friends and allies. Featuring a half-submerged, swamp-like Houston; a Dallas-Fort Worth nuclear graveyard filled with radtornadoes; and, of course, the Alamo in San Antonio. Because remember the Alamo! (Pip-Boy maps included)\n\n\u2606 A handful of colorful NPCs such as Davy Crockett, the ghoul who thinks he's in charge of the Alamo and random encounters like The Thirsty Three mariachi band who will play a tune for you if you give them some water!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat we're looking for:\n\n1. People who are proactive and capable of driving the plot forward on their own. We are giving you the world as a sandbox to play in. Go explore! Challenge yourself and others! Get creative!\n\n2. People who are fairly active in OOC chat and contribute to the conversation. You don't necessarily have to make friends or be butt buddies with everyone, but being present and invested in the RP is a huge plus.\n\n3. People who love the Fallout series just as much as we do!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you are interested in joining, please PM me for the invite link.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Please note that this is an 18+ server. Fallout is an R-rated game so adult themes such as violence, gore, drug use, and explicit language may come up in the RP.**",

            "selftext": "Hi there. My name is James and I have a number of romantic rp ideas that I would love to do with someone. I am looking for a female between the ages of 20-26 as my character will be in that age range as well. I have a face claim for my character and though it is not required of my partner to provide me with one, it would be helpful. Descriptions work totally fine with me too. Some of the ideas I had are: \n\n1. The Fighter- For the last 5 years, I've been a boxer in our hometown. I've won my fair share of fights but I've also been beaten pretty bad as well. After recovering from my latest fight, I am challenged by a guy twice my size. The odds are not in my favor but I accept the fight anyway as the payout is huge. You would play the role of my girlfriend who doesn't like me fighting, but still comes to watch and stays by my side after every fight, no matter the outcome. Bonus idea that we don't have to incorporate if you aren't comfortable with it: you could be pregnant with our child and that's why you want me to stop fighting. \n2. Parent-Teacher Interview- When your five year old daughter comes home from school and tells you that her teacher would like to meet with you, you assume it will be some bubbly young woman who is sort of childish herself. To your surprise, you are met with me. A handsome, fit, 20 something year old man in a sweater vest. We get to talking about your daughter and the source of the meeting, and then once we are done, I can't help but ask for your number and put forward the idea of getting coffee together. \n3. The Movie Star- Once upon a time, we used to date. We were together for most of high school but once we graduated, we drifted apart. I moved to LA with dreams of 'making it big' and wouldn't you know it, I did! I've been working in the film and music industry for about 12 years now and just so happen to be filming a movie in our hometown. Do we meet up again? Are there still feelings there? What have you been up to?\n4. Roommates- We are a pair of super close friends who have known each other since High School. Of course we decide to move in together once we are out of our parent's places. It's a dream set-up. We get to hang out everyday, do stuff together, it's like our normal friendship but 10x cooler. But then things start to change...we get a little...closer. I begin to put my hand on your shoulder more often, you cuddle up to me when we watch tv, you lay your head in my lap and I play with your hair when you're tired. But we don't like each other, right? Right?\n\nTraits I look for in my partner are adaptability, creativity, and an ability to respond with more than one or two lines. Sometimes, a scene is short and you can't get much out of it, that's totally fine and I understand that. But when your replies are just \\*I kiss you\\* \\*I cuddle you\\* \"yes I want food\", then it gets boring and I don't want to rp with you. I prefer to write in a novel form, no asterisks, third person or first person doesn't bother me either way, and I would like to rp over Discord because I find Reddit chat can be a little hard to manage. Hope to hear from you soon!",

I have maps made, historical figures, magic systems, geography, and nations all developed already. You will not be told about the lore of the world, only the basics that your character would be aware of, but you may choose to learn about it throughout the game's progress.\n\nAs GM, I will be roleplaying the actions of the NPCs and determining the results of what you attempt to do.\n\nIt will be done on Discord, and it will be long-term. DM me if you're interested! It will be held in 3rd person, and deep characters and serious writing is expected.

I am looking for someone who won't ghost or disappear without telling anything because I had that too many times. I expect at least a paragraph as a reply and not just a sentence.\n\n\nAs for the plot, I have an idea in my mind and I do have my character (Also a ref). I'll let you create your own character and we will see where we can take the rp after we discuss and share our characters. I want you to create your own character because It makes is more interesting and unexpected than if I choose your role. I am both okay with you playing both Female and Male character. Also, you should be willing to rp as NPC's as well (so will I)\n\nThe Rp I want to try:\n\u2022 A teenage girls from the future/past sent to your time by accident or purpose experiment, and she is trying to adapt to the new world and finds love while there.\n\n\nThanks for reading and I hope you are interested in roleplaying together, please write your fav colour at the title of your DM so I'll know you read it all the way through the text and not just spamming. I am not going to respond if your message is short.\n\nBye~",

NSFW and adult themes likely...but those things are no fun without a good story for context. While I do have some story prompts, I would generally prefer to work that out with my RP partner.\n\nPlease be able and willing to either NPC or play more than one character. I am. It is very difficult to have a good story with only two total characters.\n\nGenre preference: Fantasy or dark fantasy strongly preferred. Sci-fi if it is more Star Wars and less Star Trek. Modern only with a fantasy twist and if the world is particularly interesting. Cyberpunk is rad. Runepunk is cool. Give me some fantasy and I'm in generally. Super heroes? Strong maybe. \n\nI play through discord primarily. Send me a message here and I will send you my contact info.\n\nThanks for reading, and hope to hear from you!",

I don't mind if you're male, female, agender, nonbinary or anything in between. I don't do hetero ships (only M/M since I'm gay, I can do 18+ stuff if you really want that, but it's not a necessity. Also I am not OC friendly, and only write with canons. I don't write crossovers, but I am fine interacting with multi-muse blogs.\n\nI write triggering themes no problem, those being suicide, self-harm, mental illness, etc. I am not insistent that you write paragraphs, just whatever amount of text you think fits during that scene. The only thing I do insist on is proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation or it'll be difficult to read and understand.\n\nI'm currently looking to roleplay within either my main verse (slightly canon divergent) or the Into Darkness verse, but I can work within other verses if you prefer that. (DM me for details about the main verse.) The only requirement, whatever the verse, is established Spones.\n\nIf you are a Spock roleplayer, then I would like to explore the relationship between Spock and McCoy further, preferably within the main verse.\n\nHowever if you play any other AOS character, I am looking to either work within an existing verse or create a new one for our muses. I'm used to writing with more mainstream muses like Jim Kirk or Pavel Chekov, but muses like Khan Noonien Singh are welcome as well!\n\nIf you're still reading, then I presume you're interested, so message me for my blog url and to discuss this further.",

The citizens of New York City begin to riot and destroy the city causing city officials and diplomats to be evacuated. An investigation by CERA has determined that the viral infection was initially spread through United States currency sometime during Black Friday.*\n\n**December 7th, 2015** *The 42nd Infantry Division of the New York Army National Guard is mobilized to restore order to the city. Up to 10,000 are reported to be dead from the Dollar Flu and rioting.*\n\n**December 15th, 2015** *With a lack of food and supplies coming into the city, people have resorted to eating pigeons and local plants for food.*\n\n**December 18th, 2015** *The 42nd Infantry Division retreats from New York City and sets up a Forward Operating Base across the channel in New Jersey.*\n\n**Turbulence - A Division Store**\n\nA clear Winter morning is visible as the sun begins to cast an orange hue on the city that never sleeps. David Welsh sat up in his bed slowly as he let out a long yawn and squinted his eyes over towards the window of his modest apartment. It certainly wasn't anything great, but what else could you afford on a New York Police Officer's salary. Having been stationed here three years prior as a sleeper Strategic Homeland Division agent, he kept the money he was paid from the SHD and sent it back home to his family in Arkansas. \n\n\"Good God,\" he muttered under his breath as he cracked his back and pushed out of bed.\n\nThe slow patter of his bare feet against the hardwood floor echoed out as he began to start his day. Only being 29 years old, he felt more like 60 this beautiful Friday morning. It was Black Friday, and that meant a busy day for all of the New York City Police Department. Fights in progress, theft reports, and probably even a couple of crashes are what his shift would hold. He wasn't looking forward to it, but it made the day fly by.\n\n**Themes:** Actions and Romance\n\n**What I'm looking for in this roleplay:** I am looking for a long term writing partner who would like to write an RP in a somewhat post-apocalyptic New York City. Two sleeper government agents are activated as the city falls into chaos and work to restore order to the city and rescue her citizens from certain destruction.\n\nA little about me:\n\n* I am a 22 male (**I don't RP with people below the age of 18 due to the mature themes**).\n* I am in the EST timezone.\n* **I prefer a partner who can reply multiple times a day** or at least chat to let me know you're still interested. I totally get life gets in the way sometimes as well!\n* I am a Police Officer, so sometimes my time gets very limited (not that other jobs don't) since I work about from 5 to 6 to 7 days a week, not including doubles I sometimes pull.\n* I like to talk in OOC and plot a lot, so please let me know if you don't want to.\n* I like a lot of drama in my RPs since I feel it keeps the story interesting.\n* I would prefer to RP on discord, but if you have an option you would like to try, I am totally fine with that.\n* I'm pretty easy going, so if you have more to add to the plot or the basic narrative I typed above, please don't hesitate to let me know.\n* I try to keep my posts around 1 - 3 paragraphs, but I can definitely post more if it warrants it.\n* I like to post music with my posts sometimes if I feel there is a need for a dramatic feel in a post. If you don't like that, please let me know beforehand.",

            "selftext": "Hello. \n\nI\u2019m pretty new here, although I\u2019m not new to roleplay. I write in **third person only.** It\u2019s just what I\u2019m comfortable with. I ask that you\u2019re **18+** if contacting me for RP, as things can get dark or even graphic with romantic situations, etcetera. \n\nWhile I do believe in quantity over quantity, I typically write at least 2 paragraphs and can send more depending on the scenario at hand. So being descriptive and literate is a huge plus. \n\nAs for the RP, I\u2019m looking for anything that can have plenty of adventure, romance, dark subjects, witty banter and of course maybe even character development. **I am not looking for a GM and I am not a GM.** I just want to collaborate and share NPCs, running major plots by one another. I think that sounds fun. \n\nI RP on Discord. If you\u2019re interested, feel free to message me and we can go from there. \n\nThank you.",

I specialize in para-RP style third-person roleplays. I tend to write a bit of smut but the story is also important to me I tend to write 60/40 story/smut. I have no issues with multi-shipping either as I am polyamorous. I could care less about your gender, only that you are 18+ if you are going to write with me.\n\n**Preferences/Characters**\n\nI tend to write Connor, Rk900 (nines), and Gavin Reed. I love AU's, such as reverse au where androids are humans and humans are androids. My top ships are Reed!900, Reed!800, Hancon, GavinxHank, Honestly any type of combo including poly ships; but as I stated before I'm open to all ships. I tend to play males and play better when I am writing M/M. If its M/F I will admit the smut is going to be very lackluster and blackout time skip.\n\n**Reply Speed and Length**\n\nI answer pretty frequently. If I won't be responding quickly I will let you know as I do work full time, and sometimes there is just no will to write. I don't expect you to match my length as long as you write at least a small paragraph.\n\n**Writing Preferences:**\n\nAnything smut must be consensual between the characters.\n\nAU's I Love: Alpha/Beta/Omega, Royal, Coffee shop, Vet, baker, ect. Honestly, I'm down for anything if we can think of a plot for it.\n\nIf you have any questions or desire to write with me please DM me.",

A castle sat upon the hillside, overlooking it all. One single window illuminated with the light from a burning candle. \n\nA young girl sat inside, orange flames flickering in the reflection of her cerulean gaze. The wind howled against the cobblestone, a cloud edging along the sky to reveal a full moon, white and eerie. \n\nCold claws ripped through her chest and curled their bony fingers around her heart, sending icy chills down her spine. Something was happening, something sinister. \n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThank you for reading my post! I have a rough idea for a plot that I would love to work out with another Roleplay. \n\nMy idea would take place in medieval times. Somehow, a portal would be opened to the underworld, allowing demons, vampires, ghouls, and all sorts to crawl into our world. \n\nI\u2019m not sure how our characters would fit. Perhaps mine is the witch who opened it, a supernatural hunter, a half vampire. Or yours could be any of these things as well. \n\nI want this to be a dark and horrific roleplay, with action and adventure and possibly some forbidden love. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested, shoot me a PM!",

Mostly because I like to have adult themes in my Roleplay to allow from some conflict and tension.\n\nSo just to start out with, here are some Genres I\u2019m into doing (just I heads up I don\u2019t do fandoms) I do love Romance in all of my Roleplay so that is a given.\n\n-Fantasy (All Kinds)\n\n-Modern Drama\n\n-Victorian Romance\n\n-Dark Sci-Fi \n\nAnd there is one genre I won\u2019t do and that is Post Apoc. It\u2019s not my favorite and most likely won\u2019t do it.\n\nI am looking for a Roleplay partner who is up for a darker romance. Those themes I will go into those themes through DMs or some other platform once we get chatting.\n\nSome other things you should know is I am an artist so I usually draw most of my face claims, however I don\u2019t require you to have any face claims, descriptions are fine with me.\n\nResponses should be a paragraph or more. I tend to get lengthy with my responses which can be really fun if the partner is doing that as well!\n\nI am usually on 24/7 most of the time (PST.) However I only require my partners to at least post once a day, and if something comes up in life? Don\u2019t worry about it, just don\u2019t forget to tell me.\n\nLastly I just want to thank you again for reading! As I said I do like using discord, so send me a reply, and don\u2019t be shy!

            "selftext": "Cold gusted from the chilled bar top in waves and Sam sniffed at her drink. Condensation trickled from the glass and dribbled down her wrist.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t smell like whiskey,\u201d she said, fighting the urge to wrinkle up her nose. It didn\u2019t *look* like whiskey either. It was a virulent shade of orange, sparkling under the pink overhead lights as she rolled it around crushed ice. The barman snorted, the expression twisting his ghost-white face.\n\nHe\u2019d never seen the sun. Space colony born and raised.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t sell whiskey, earth girl. We sell *wisky.\"*\n\nHe pronounced the word like he was spitting it.\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nSam felt her face burn a little. She had assumed it was a spelling mistake.\n\n*Because colonists are idiots?* She could almost hear her brother in her head. *Because they're illiterate?* He'd always been the one that cared about colonists, their rights, the one who'd fought in protests and made the news as the rich boy who cared. Sometimes she defended him. Sometimes she fought with him just as much as their parents.\n\nThe barman gave a thin smile that could have been one of contempt or of sympathy.\n\n\"*Oh*,\" he agreed. \"Careful there, earth girl. *Wisky* ain't for sippin'; you ain't used ta it, you'll be on the floor in a half hour's time.\"\n\nShe nodded before he moved to serve the next patron, eyeing her drink warily. If she wasn't sat alone, she might have snapped at him. 'Earth girl,' he said. Like it was an insult. *At least I wouldn't be an alien on my own home planet.* She allowed her mind to wander back to her brother.\n\n*What would you think of me now?* Sam wondered to herself. *Would you be proud? Sat in a colonist bar with a colonist drink.* She doubted it. He had always hated the backpackers who tried out colony life 'as a gimmick.' Sam had always looked down on them too; if only because she couldn't understand why you'd dirty yourself with space rabbits in the name of soul searching. *Well, I'm here because of you, Ben. You went running and I'm chasing. Maybe I'll reach you before dad does. Maybe I'll even reach you before you kill yourself for a cause that doesn't even benefit you.*\n\nShe crossed and uncrossed her legs, trying not to twinge at the icy droplets splashed on her thighs. Her skirt and blouse had been perfectly fine for her quarters. The upper side of *Concordia*, a 12 million strong space station, catered broadly to botanists, biologists and businessmen - temperate, polished and beautiful. The lower was the working side, the side that supported that 12 million- well, 12 million being the official statistic. If rumour were to be believed (and she did believe it) most working-class colonists rejected the one child limit without a permit. Regardless, the less affluent sectors were either freezing cold or boiling hot depending on their distance from the engines. The bar she'd been asked to meet at, the Blue Dandelion, verged on the former.\n\nSam shivered and glanced around. At 6pm most of the people were workers coming off their shift and still in uniform. None dressed in emerald-and-gold blouses and leather skirts. None with the freckled skin of an Earther or salon pampered blonde hair.\n\nAnd none of them appeared to be the who she'd gotten the message from, responding to her note on the port's message board asking for information from anyone who had seen Ben. Or maybe they were- she couldn't tell. She couldn't tell anything on this glorified space rock. \n\nShe sniffed at her drink again and in a bout of frustration fueled courage, swallowed a mouthful. And promptly descended into a coughing fit. *Oh good lord.*\n\n**DONE**\n\nWant to come chat to an idiot Earther in a bar? Want to advise her on a drink more to her tastes? Want to tell her you've seen her brother? Want to stab her? Anything's fine!\n\nPlease shoot a message if you're interested. Whether this is a one off short term writing exercise together or it turns into a long-term thing, I just want to have fun creating something with you. This is generic sci-fi, no worldbuilding done from what I've written here, so feel free to just write a response. Hope to hear from you!",

            "selftext": "So right now, I'm looking for a partner to RP with. I mostly RP on forums nowadays but I can also RP on stuff like Google Docs as well. I'm willing to RP Star Wars, sci-fi, black ops, war, and in the superhero genre, whether it's like vigilantism or superpowers, idc. Anything is great really. I have quite a few interesting plots in mind, but most of these plots might require more than 2 roleplayers. \n\nAs for my character, you could compare him to Deadpool a little bit. For the time being, he's known as Blackout. I haven't really settled on a name for him yet lol.\n\nNow I'm currently looking for any male and/or female characters that are badass, witty, or can at least put up a fight (RP-wise). The plots I have in mind really depend on the characters' ability to fight, think creatively, or have any useful skills. I might even be willing to do romance and smut with a female character, but only if the writer is +18.\n\nI guess if you're interested you could just comment down below.",

            "selftext": "Is anyone here interested in Mass effect? I find the universe and the characters in these games very compelling and would be very happy to roleplay in this world! \n\nPreferably I would like to loosely follow the plot in the games but since we all know how bad the ending was I'd also like to mix and change things into something of our own. I've got a lot of ideas about the Reapers and the ending but would rather discuss these things in private. I don't mind original characters added in nor do I mind giving some side characters more spotlight if there's some minor character you fell in love with, it's all fine by me! I would really like to include all of the crew though but obviously some would have smaller roles than others. I might also be interested in post me3 plot but that would need some careful planning. I do have some ideas in mind for that too!\n\nI might be willing to do original story with original characters as well if the idea we come up with is exciting enough!\n\n As far as romance goes, I must admit I'm mostly used to mxm but I can do fxm and fxf as well. Especially if I can write Shepard. Pairings I'm mainly interested in:\n\n\n\nShepard/Garrus\n\nShepard/Thane \n\n\n\nBut I can definitely do others too! Like Tali/Liara, Wrex/anyone (I'd write Wrex) EDI/Joker. Honestly I'm probably open to anything you want, the only thing I ask is that I can write Shepard against Thane or Garrus. I know, I know, it's selfish! \n\n\n\nI am fairly active and on good days I can do multiple replies, sometimes it's just one or two. It depends on my work but I will always let you know!

In the past two centuries of the Kingdom, resources such as the power of Steam and the discovery of a magical substance known as Elixir made the country much more technologically advanced than its breatheron. This lead to many of the other countries attempting to recreate the technology, with most of them succeeding and creating their own Steam and Elixir powered machines. After a while, peace was relatively achieved between many of the countries. But of course, peace never lasts long. A Demon by the name Azrael created a massive army whose ranks were filled with mercenaries and demon spawn. She swept through the land, killing those who got in her way, aiming for just pure destruction.  Eventually, heroes gathered and with their powers combined, they were able to defeat her.       After the war with Azrael, the land settled back into its relative peace. But with regiments of Azrael's army still out there, and monster attacks rising, the world seems to be on the brink of a major change.\n\nThe chat itself:\n\n\u2022Kind staff that if you ask they will either have the answer or redirect you to me.

            "selftext": "I literally couldn't think of a better title than that, I swear.\n\n\nThat aside, Hello! I'm back, today looking for less of a prompt, and more of a...general search? I have no idea. Before I get into the nitty gritty, allow me to say a bit about myself. I'm a 20-something male with plenty of writing experience, about 6ish years or so. I'm the kind of guy who (proudly) sprouts absurd and out there ideas, literally just on a whim or the slightest bit of inspiration. Seriously. Sometimes I can get a little crazy. My post length is anywhere between 1-3 paragraphs, but I came definitely get more out if I'm feeling inspired.  I'm also, for whom it might concern, in the central timezone of the United States. That being said, I have a horrid sleep schedule, so I'll usually be up pretty late into the night.\n\n\nWith that out of the way, let me say what I'm looking for. I am (unsurprisingly) looking for a female partner to nerd out with, 18+ of course, just in case we *do* go down a NSFW road at some point (It's welcome, but I'd like to not to be the focus of anything). **I will not, under any circumstances, write with someone under the age of 18**. I'm not comfortable with it, and I'm sorry if someone out there disagrees with this. Additionally, I'm looking for someone that I can call my friend. All proper and business is boring. I like to freak out with my writing partners. Come up with dumb plotlines or AUs. If you're looking for something strictly professional, I'm probably not your guy.\n\n\n\nFinally, we get down to what I'm *really* gonna be vague on. As you might've guessed by the title, I'm looking for something fantasy related. What specifically, you might ask? I have no clue. I'm a sucker for romance plots, with an epic adventure hanging above our characters' head. Be it slaying gods, or sealing away an ancient evil, I can't get enough of it. I love all sorts of different fantasy races, too. Elves? Oh yeah. Demons? Sure! Any kind of Yokai? *my god, that'll press my buttons in juuust the right way*. That being said, anyone that brings an idea with **Kitsune** as a major emphasis will make me *very* happy. Anyway. If you have any existing ideas, please, throw them at me! I love reading through plots n ideas. Want to create something new? We can chat for a bit, and see what we both like.\n\n\nI'm rambling now, aren't I? I think I've gone on for long enough. If I've caught your eye, please, shoot me a message, and I'll get to you ASAP. I get a lot of messages, so I'm sorry if I don't get to you right away. Some messages also slip through the cracks, or don't follow a certain obvious rule, so sorry on that regard as well. Just be sure to include your favorite color in your title, so I know you got down this far. I won't respond without it, because I don't enjoy it when people don't read my post. Like I said, I'm usually around into the late hours of the night, so you'll likely catch me. Thanks for reading!\n\n\n(Oh, by the way, don't send me a message only saying \"hey I think we can work something out\" or the like. Tell me about yourself, have some energy. Those kind of intros give me life)",

I\u2019m personally keen on writing more paragraphs to add much more details in my characters, so I\u2019ll be writing more, but one paragraph is the minimum. (5 sentences).\n\nI\u2019m someone that is very keen on returning back to doing semi-literate/literate RP\u2019s. I have 7 years of experience under my belt and I'm returning to only improve my writing even further.\n\nI\u2019m very interested in an original medieval story setting with no fantasy races if possible, which means no elves, dwarves, orcs or anything of the sort, and restricted magic.  Preferably around the middle ages. Right now, I\u2019m willing for things to start off slowly and as events and situations and obstacles start to sprout, that the plot slowly begins to challenge our characters as it progresses. We'll also be brainstorming about what sort of world this is, and suitable plots that set the story in motion. (I have a few ideas in mind already.)\n\nI understand that life should take precedence before roleplay; I also have other artistic hobbies I engage in throughout the day, however, it would be very appreciative if you could let me know when you're unable to do scenes. (Preferably would like a consistent time that is good for the both of us to focus on RP.)\n\nIf this all seems interesting to you, please give me a PM. I look forward to doing some scenes with you.",

Also I'm planning on making this rp SFW although I am fine with some violent scenes. \n\nIf you're interested in this idea please message me and I will be happy to give you my discord and we can start to brain storm on world building plot etc.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you :)",

English is not my native language, but as you can hopefully tell, I'm trying my best!\n\nI am online rather frequently and would therefore prefer frequent replies, more than once or twice a day (unless one of us gets busy, because that's just life, I get that).\n\nMy preferred genre is medieval fantasy (can be dark and gritty or lighthearted, or a healthy balance of both). I'm a huge fan of Tolkien, so if you'd like to rp something within the fandom, I'd be open to that!\nWith that being said, I also love to do worldbuilding! \n\nI am open to romance, but I prefer if it were more of a side venture/would go hand in hand with a more developed story. I'd love this to be a long term thing, too.\n\nI play both male and female characters, (though at the moment I prefer males) and I accept both male and female partners! Or whatever, be a toaster for all I care, do your thing! \n(If you want to go for romance, i'm open to mxf and mxm)\n\nI'm also open to groups! So if you're looking for more members or are interested in making one, I'm definitely your gal! I'd really love to make some friends too.\n\nOr, if you're as lost as me, let's make a server together - I'm really craving a creative outlet.\n\nNote: I am not currently interested in any fandoms (besides what I mentioned above).\n\nI have a few ideas and would also love to hear yours! For communication I mainly use Discord, but I'm not opposed to using another medium if I feel we have something going!\n\nWith all that being said - if you made it this far, I applaud you, kind stranger, and I'd be super happy to hear from you, either in the comments of this post or in PM!",

            "selftext": "I'm back with the same prompt, only this time I'm going to be more honest and put in more effort.\n\n**Brief Overview so you can figure out if you want to read this whole mess or not:** Fear the Dark is a sort of sci-fi fantasy/supernatural world where humans have left Earth to escape the so-called \u201cmonsters.\u201d They live on spaceships as do the mythics (monsters). Bad things start happening on board one ship and a few decide to get down to the root of the problem.\n\n**Intro:** Welcome to \"Fear the Dark\". \u201cFear the Dark\u201d has been many things including a story plot, a roleplay, and a potential comic idea (that last one might actually come true hopefully). I really love this world and the characters I've made for it. Since I came up with it a few years ago, some of the ideas are a little awkward and cringey, but I think I\u2019ve fixed most of it.  \n\n**Summary of the World:** Roughly 200 years before the actual story takes place, a message was broadcasted all over the world telling people that the monsters they feared when they were young were real. The world was told that the only way they could survive was to flee Earth, because humanity's cruelty had given these monsters power, and they'd need a temporary safe haven to build up strength to actually fight back. So, they built giant spaceships that eventually became known as sort of space cities (now called interplanetary cities). They fit a decently sized portion of the population on these ships and took off. Eventually, all the ships got separated, so the others' fates are unknown.  \nThe roleplay will take place on one of these ships that I've named \"New New York,\" as if the idea of \u201cnew\u201d anything wasn't ridiculous enough. It only took a few years for the humans to realize they weren't alone on their new home, so the first 100 years or so were spent on a war followed by a truce. Then came the years of trying to get along which is the point that we're at. So, the short-lived war happened in the beginning, but there is still quite a bit of tension among the two groups. Humans will deny service to the monsters, which are referred to as mythics, and the other way around.  \nThere's an extremely biased peacekeeping force called the \"Knights.\" They're human-based and very against mythic members. The organization's objective is to get rid of any mythic causing trouble, but it's not uncommon to see Knights harassing an innocent mythic on the street. Not every Knight is like this though, and many simply play their role as a sort of police force.  \n\n\n**Your role:** Your character can be any kind of person or creature you want. New New York is just like any major city we have now except it\u2019s far more technologically advanced. When I came up with this story, I imagined a limitless potential for the types of mythics. Basically, any supernatural being that comes from a religion, legend, or rumor exists in this world, so you can be anything you want. You can also be a Knight or a simple citizen. The possibilities are endless, but boundaries do exist. However, I don\u2019t know what they are yet, so I\u2019ll just have to tell you if I don\u2019t think something will fit (can\u2019t really imagine that happening though).\n\n**Plot:** Basically, unrest has begun to spread through the city, not that there was never not unrest. There\u2019s a deeper reason behind it all and you can seek out that reason or just try to avoid the chaos.\n\n**As for me and my expectations:** I tried to get back into roleplaying but it kinda failed, so I'm making another new start. I expect at least a paragraph from you, because I remember far too many times when I've had to carry on a story by myself, because I was only getting bare bones sentences for replies. I'm fairly active (though college is starting soon and that may change) and expect the same (within reason) of anyone who I roleplay with. All in all, I just want to have fun, and I miss the interactions that roleplaying brought to me. If you have any questions, concerns, or comments, feel free to voice them. I'm pretty flexible and willing to work with a lot of things, so if you're interested just message me!",

I do have ideas of my own that I\u2019m willing to share, but I find the best stories come together from those equally passionate.\n\n**Co-Writers:** I\u2019m looking for friendly, literate people.

            "selftext": "Rheaume had been asleep when the klaxons sounded. Before he even knew what was happening, he'd been thrown from his bunk. He landed hard, and with a yell, as had a few of his fellow crew. He got to his feet, swearing and holding his elbow, and looked around, confused. Some of the crew had run for the door, still clad only in their undergarments, and he trotted to join them.\n\nThe ship rocked again, and the klaxons changed. A call to battle stations had changed to an announcement to abandon ship. The ship rocked once more, and for a moment, the gravity cut off. Rheaume had been mid-stride, and had floated up briefly before the gravity kicked in again. Crew people fell to the deck, some heavily, some light enough to carry on running. Rheaume had been one of the former, which had saved his life. Ahead of him, a blast ripped through the hallway, shredding those unfortunate enough to be in the way. A moment later, their remains were sucked out into the vacuum of space. Rheaume screamed as he was carried down the hall toward the void, but was saved when an emergency bulkhead slammed down, protecting the ship's atmosphere. His momentum caused him to slide into the severed legs of a crew person who'd had the misfortune of being a meter ahead of him, cut in half by the door.\n\nRheaume laid there for a moment, stunned, then got up and began to run the other way, joining other crew, and the few civilians quartered in that section of the ship. The thump of escape pods being jettisoned filled the hall, almost drowning out the calls for help, and people asking after family and friends. Rheaume made it into a pod, saw that someone else was in there already, and before he could get seated, another blast caused the door to seal, and they were launched out into space.\n\nHe was slammed violently into a crash couch, the breath knocked from him, and lay there for a moment. The pod's computer did some quick scans and computations, then fired its engines again, sending them toward the nearest habitable world. Rheaume managed to get his crash webbing into place, then passed out.\n\n((Hello there. I'm looking for a partner to help explore a new world with. It's NSFW due to the violence and gore the characters will discover and experience, and who doesn't enjoy a good sex scene to blow off some steam with? Because of that, I need you to be over 18. I don't have many limits, but my three main ones are that I don't like people writing my character's actions and words for me. I can write for myself. Also, I'm not a fan of giant, bimbo-esque body parts. Finally, no furries/aliens - though it's a big galaxy, I'd rather play with human characters. This might even be a first contact situation. I write in the third-person, past tense style. I don't mind if you write first- and present, though. I also write 1-3 paragraphs per post. I'd like the same. Any more than that, and one player isn't able to give their input so well. If you're a male on your side of the screen, but play female, that's alright with me. If you're interested, hit me up. I have role played some taboo and violent things, but I will respect any limits set before me. Letting you know ahead of time so that it's not a surprise later on, giving you a reason to ghost.\n\nI'd prefer to play on Discord, but messages here, not the chat function, is also okay.))",

I\u2019d prefer 20+ if possible. I enjoy long-detailed roleplays, but not every reply has to be paragraphs long. \n\nAs for themes/stories, I have a few in mind. I am particularly interested in vintage stories. I am in love with the \u201860s and \u201870s, so any sort of hippie/bohemian story would be excellent. I\u2019m also a fan of true crime, and a \u201860s cult theme is appealing as well. I enjoy the 1950\u2019s as well. Lastly, I am interested in doing a romance roleplay, NSFW scenes are permitted but are not necessary. \n\nAs for fandoms, I enjoy Peaky Blinders, Blade Runner, and Mad Men. I\u2019m not very much into sci-fi (despite Blade Runner) and I like to have realistic roleplays. \n\nPlease be literate and willing to roleplay long-term. I enjoy OOC talk as well. \n\nPM me if interested!",

Originally we were all about the first Dead Rising game, but we've diversified since then. At the moment we have two roleplays, both in single topic style:  \n\n\nCity of Misfortune: a Dead Rising 2 RP with zombies galore.  \n\n\nBlood ties: in a seemingly sleepy Midwest town, not everything is as it seems as vampires, werewolves, old gods and eldritch horrors come crawling out of the woodwork.  \n\n\nWe are also open to any new RP ideas!  \n\n\nThe roleplaying takes place on our old Proboards site (we have a Discord server too, the link of which can be found in the 'Rules and Guidelines' section).  \n\n\n[http://livingdeadrpg.proboards.com/](http://livingdeadrpg.proboards.com/)",

            "selftext": "\"A lipstick lesbian is slang for a lesbian who exhibits a greater amount of feminine gender attributes relative to other gender expressions, such as wearing make-up, wearing dresses or skirts and having other characteristics associated with feminine women.\"\n\nSome people can't tell when a girl likes other girls at first glance. But that's fine, sometimes it's difficult. The stereotypical lesbian looks pretty trashy, admittedly. But there are those that take care of themselves, wear make up and perfume and don't drive trucks. Getting past that, the person themselves can act vastly different from what you'd expect.\n\nThis is the particular case of one girl who felt as though things around her love life would work themselves out, even though most of the people she associated with weren't exactly her type. Namely because they were guys that she knew through friends. She knew that she wasn't attracted to them, and was especially nice about it, and they left her alone about it. Until that one fateful day...\n\nBut that's getting ahead of things. At her school, she had a reputation of being nice to everyone and a fairly good student. When she caught wind of a rumor of a private school student coming to spend her last two years at her school, a public one. It wasn't a big deal to her, until she started at that school. The new girl, Cecil was her name, probably short for Cecilia, but no one ever asked. Her hair was long, wavy and jet black, decent sized body and a somewhat athletic body from snowboarding, an exotic sport in their little town where everyone knew everyone. She liked to wear short cut T-shirts, baggy jeans and sneakers, mostly just glad she didn't need to wear a uniform. \n\nOne day, Cecil came up to this girl in front of the school and tapped her on the shoulder. The sight of her sent this pour girl's heart aflutter, bringing along the butterflies in her stomach and the weakness in her knees. As a result, she couldn't answer the new girl's question, which resulted in her apologizing and moving to ask someone else. And these few things set in motion a turn of events she never could've expected in a million years.\n\n*So that's the prompt. The idea here is that your character is the girly girl that falls for my not quite so girly girl. I'd like for them to explore a lot of things together and I'm really hoping for this to be long term. As for your character, all I ask is that she be the girly girl I've explained, she can have any kind of personality, hobbies, what have you that you want. So yeah, if you're interested just send me your questions and stuff.*",

            "selftext": "Six months ago, the unthinkable happened; at a summit intended to broker the first real, lasting truce between the superheroes and supervillains of the world, everyone attending disappeared. All that were left were the scraps, the remnants, the ones that were left; the weak, the rookies, the old, the retired, the injured, and the cripplingly-specialised.\n\nIn other words, you. \n\nOne month ago, letters and emails appeared in mailboxes and inboxes, inviting you- yes, you- to become part of a new Hero initiative. The world needs hope, you were told; the world has villains and criminals that still need to be stopped; the world needs you. You were told to report to Worthing Academy For Troubled Youths- secretly the pre-eminent school for the gifted- where the Headmaster, the Faceripper, renowned ex-hero and mentor to the elite would welcome you.\n\nToday, you meet at the academy for the first day of the rest of your lives. Welcome, heroes. Welcome, all.\n\nWhatever Happened To All The Heroes? is a literate, group roleplay based around the incoming class to the Worthing Academy, and their adventures and misadventures. We're a friendly group who like to kick back and chat as much as we like to get some serious roleplaying done. With plenty of experience of both group and individual roleplays, you'll find an environment of people who love to write, and who love to write well, and who love to tell a story.\n \n**A few ground rules:**\n All characters are weak. That's just the way of the universe. There's no Supermen here, no Batmen or Wonder Women or Captain Americas. At best, you'll be a retired hero who was sidelined for being old; at worst, you're a rookie with no control, no experience, and no respect.\n\nPlease be 'literate'. That means at least a couple of plot-advancing paragraphs per post. Loners and passive-aggressive corner-sitters will need to put in extra effort to be involved; you'll have to come us, we won't come to you.\n\nPlease be active; taking a few days out here and there is fine, but if you're going to be inactive for long periods of time, please let someone know.\n\nHave fun!: We're all fans of superheroes, and if you're not having fun, what's the point, right?\n\nAll characters must be of legal age; college age at the youngest. For liability reasons, the school is unable to accept students under the age of 18, even if they 'look over 18', or 'are secretly a 100 years old'. \n\nOkay, so feel free to message me with questions and stuff. If you're looking to join, put your favourite superhero- or villain- in the title, and answer me these questions three:\nHow much experience do you have?\nIf you had any superpower, what would it be, and would you use it for good, evil, or personal gain?\nIt's not a question, but a quick one-paragraph writing sample would be great.\n\n**Please do not use Reddit chat. I don't use it, and will ignore all messages that come through on it**.\n\n\nSee you soon, hopefully!",

I generally do around 1-3 paragraphs, and prefer quality over quantity. Please be at least semi-literate in posts. Typos are ok, just do your best. Must be ok with organic escalation into adult situations. Must be 18 or older. I can role play over e-mail or discord.\n\nI usually prefer fandom based role plays, but can be persuaded into a good original plot if it is fantasy or sci-fi.\n\nFandoms I Love:\n\nMarvel Cinematic Universe (incl. Venom &amp; Deadpool)\nDetroit: Become Human\nSupernatural\nDC Universe (AU only or not-canon universe as I'm not very up to date on canon)\nSherlock (BBC version)\n\nSubjects I Like:\n\nAlpha/beta/omega dynamics \nRoyal\nAnything with magic\nParanormal/supernatural themes (particularly angelxdemon, mermaids, or vampires)\nEtc\n\nWhat I Don't Do:\n\nFurries\nMedieval\nHigh School/Teenagers (characters must be 18 or older to be in a relationship in the fic)\n\nSide Note: I get a lot of requests to do MxF.

            "selftext": "Taesolis is a freeform RP with the theme of creative freedom. We strive to give players as much leg room as possible, allowing you to create characters, races, nations, and more. It's meant to be essentially a giant sandbox for people to use as a creative outlet. You can RP however you like. Whether you want your story to be action-packed, political, slice of life, or even romantic is all your choice.\n\n# Premise\n\nThe RP is set in an original sci-fi universe with fantasy elements seamlessly incorporated into it. Our lore is constantly being expanded. There's a variety of  diverse factions and planets. We have a wiki for anyone who'd like to learn more about it!\n\nWe also use a unique magic system, which much of our lore is based on. \n\nWe've built the setting to have open-ended scenarios for players to discover. Currently Taesolis is primarily set in the Solaris system, but we have plans for expanding the setting to the galaxy through in-RP means. There are temples waiting to be explored; planets with unsolved mysteries; various wars to be won; and more.\n\nOur RP is structured around plots. There's a main storyline, but in between arcs we'd like to have other side plots happening, to give people a break and do whatever they'd like before diving back in. Players can also run their own plots as well, allowing people to tell stories that they want to tell.\n\n# What can I do in Taesolis?\n\nAnything. Whether it's getting really creative and in-depth with character creation, forming nations, creating races, you can go for it. If you want to run your own plots and tell intriguing stories for other players, go for it! If you just want to participate in plots and make a difference with your characters, that's also fine. We're a very flexible and accomodaiting server.\n\n# What We're Looking For\n\nWe want people who can take initiative in RP to join! Proactive players will be heavily rewarded for making an effort to progress the storyline. We encourage character arcs, friendships, and rivalries to make our RP interesting.\n\nOur group is very welcoming. We're just some people looking to have fun :D\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe hope you come check us out!\n\nDiscord: [https://discord.gg/xGPEFWf](https://discord.gg/xGPEFWf)",

I often don't put too much about myself here because If you're truly interested I often prefer you ask me yourself!\n\nI'm looking for a partner interested in the idea of a cyberpunk-like world with crime rampant and neon/rain all over the place.~ Only thing is, imagine your stereotypical cyberpunk city... but now it's one colossal, multi-leveled building. Two-hundred or more levels of massive spanning streets. All the cyberpunk you want, in one place. Some of the levels (the richer blooded ones especially) can be taller and simulate sky, etc. While some are constantly experiencing rain from the sprinklers and are cramped with neon signs and dystopian living.\n\nI want to play a rookie cop, who has to dive head first into the impossible tide of life here. Idealistic, naive, and good hearted... All things that will be tested and broken by crime and everyday life under duress in the city.\n\nI want NSFW themes to be included, please discuss them with me in private! 18+ Partners only please.~\n\nWith that being said, I prefer the feminine-genders, but am willing to to play across anyone on a good story!\n\nI'm very friendly and approachable, but I dislike writers who can't atleast give me two para's a reply. If you are someone who isn't able to hit that criteria, or isn't sure, then It would be best for you to move on. \u2665 PM me if interested!

Men and women alike now search for the Pirate King and his crew, but they still remain a mystery to this day. With the throne of king absent, ambitious eyes sought to shake the world.

            "selftext": "Hey there folks! The name\u2019s Cosmo. I'm 17 and looking to do some space roleplay! Currently, I don't really have a set a story or character in mind. I typically make my character compliment my rp partner\u2019s character or the story my rp partner and I create.\n\nWhich brings me to my next point! If you're up for it. I would absolutely love to create a whole universe with you! Slowly but surely making a thriving cosmos with each planet we visit and create along the way! I'm fine with more dark themes but I would prefer if at the beginning the rp to be more lighthearted and then see how it takes us from there\n\nPerhaps for each planet or adventure, we visit we can take turns making the story for that planet/adventure and controlling the other characters in the said story! \n\nTalking about the story. I'd like if we had a main overarching goal. it may be as simple as our characters wanting to strike it rich. To something more convoluted like taking down the alien government for some reason. Whatever the case. I truly believe we've got to have some kind of ultimate goal that each adventure slowly but surely makes it's way up to.\n\nNow then world-building aside let us talk about things more specific about the characters. First off I'm cool with the romance of any kind as long as it's a natural progression. Gay, Lesbian, Straight, Queer, Hive mind romance. You name it. I'm probably up for it. Of course, If it gets nasty we're gonna have to fade to black because again. I'm 17.  I'm also quite partial to one heck of a bromance so romance is not required. Also hey before you send me a pm. Make sure to add your favorite tv show in said pm. I won't reply if you don't!\n\nNow then. Character races! My fellow Redditor. This is SPACE. If you want the weirdest possible alien species. Let\u2019s. Do. It. Do you want a plain human? That's a Classic. I really don't care. Basically, just don't make an overpowered character and we're gonna be good!\n\nNext up lengths and speed of reply. Honestly at most I require at least one reply each week. I get life can be busy so that's all I ask. If you want to message each other more than once a week talk to me about it. We can figure something out. Secondly lengths. I've  always believed in quality over quantity. So write as much as you please. Whether it be three sentences or six paragraphs. Just be sure it's written well. I'm not gonna get onto you for small grammar or misspellings but nothing to huge please! \n\nFinally, I'm fine with any platform but prefer discord. Thanks for reading!",

I'm gonna try my best to keep this short and sweet!\n\n**Please try to not use reddit chat as I do not frequently check it.**\n\n----\n\nI am a female, and I'm 20 years old. I'm just looking for somebody to roleplay some good ole modern-day romantic slice of life with. I have grown tired of the fast-paced sci fi adventure stories, and the stressful horror plots. I just want to be a regular degular human navigating through a regular degular human relationship!\n\n----\n\n**What I\u00a0*don't*\u00a0want:**\n\n\n- Anybody under the age of 18. (Preferably 20+.)\n\n\n- Very long eplies. Yes, it's good to be literate, I definitely don't want one liners or borderline incomprehensable replies, but if you're looking for somebody to write you a novel... I'm not your girl. A good couple of paragraphs is enough! Maybe less - if we're at a mundane stage of the roleplay.\n\n\n- NSFW scenes. I know it's a natural part of any relationship, I would just rather is be *fade-to-black* style. Ie: alluded to, but we don't actually have to write out the scenes. I will do it every now and then if you want to, but mainly I'd prefer fade-to-black.\n\n\n- Very dark plots. I don't want to be part of the mafia.\n\n\n- Any sort of OOC photo trading. I'm not going to send you a selfie of me and I don't expect one of you either. I prefer using face claims for our characters.\n\n----\n\n**What I\u00a0*do*\u00a0want:**\n\n- Simple plots. Even cheesy, cliche plots. (New roommates? Long time best friends growing feelings for each other? You broke into my apartment while drunk one night? We hate each other but we both have a mutual friend so we have to put up with each other? I dunno! Hit me with your favorite plot and we can figure something out. :))\n\n\n- Character descriptions beforehand. Physical descriptions, photo refs, likes and dislikes. Any basic information to give us something to go off of.\n\n\n- Clear communication between us! It's totally fine if we don't click like you thought we would, or if you got bored, or if you're going to be busy. I'd just rather get a warning before ghosting. No questions asked at all! And I'll have the same respect for you. :)\n\n----\n\nI use kik and discord (with a preference for discord). So PM me and we can figure something out for us!",

            "selftext": "It didn't take long to get used to the humidity anymore. Not that he ever sweated less, because that was likely to never change. The air wasn't so oppressive to his lungs, though. The stickiness of the air in his lungs, the damp feeling that never left his clothing, nothing bothered him here any longer. He didn't really notice it after so many visits to this world.\n\nCrouched inside of a large bush, he peered into the clearing. The firelight danced from behind the wooden fence, and the three guards could barely be seen. Two stood at either side of the entrance, and a third was in a sort of watch tower, more of a platform, really, that extended above the opening. It was maybe 35 meters to the entrance from his position. It would take 3 shots, pop, pop, pop, and they would be dead before they knew what happened. Easy? The easiest. Was that what was about to happen? Never in a million worlds. \n\nThese people hadn't ever seen a gun before, and who knew what the consequences would cause here if that technology was ever revealed to them this early in their history. No, stealth would be key here. It was time for the open hand, not the fist. The good thing was there wasn't TOO much stealth needed. If he was fast enough, he could really just make a run for it, and with a little luck, he wouldn't even be pierced with an arrow or spear.\n\nHe didn't think  he would be totally unscathed though, as good of hunters as these people were. To hit an elephant, which was really not an elephant, but there was no word or creature like it in his world, in the eye, on the back of a horse at full gallop took skill. When that \"elephant\" had two trunks, 8 tusks, and only one eye in the center of it's forehead? Even harder. But he had seen these people do just that.\n\nHe waited, waited, and waited. The fire flickered, and the guards guarded. \n\nThen, with no warning, there was the sound of air being sucked in, and a roaring explosion. Some 100 meters to his right, a pillar of fire shot into the air, black smoke billowing away from it.  The two guards on the ground looked at each other, then took off running towards the explosion. The man in the bush stood up, and began to swing a small sling with a rock it it. He had found that on this world, and during his time here, practiced with it. He was no where as good as these people, but he was no slouch. From his standing position, his entire upper body was free of the bush. \n\nHe spun, spun, and let fly. A stone flew, and grazed the remaining guard on his temple. Not a direct shot, but enough to knock him out, at least for a few moments. As the guard fell in a heap, the man waded out of the bush, and began to run towards the entrance gate. For as tall as he was, with his dark green shirt and dark jeans, he hid in the darkness well, at least until he was in the confines of the gates. There, the campfires danced, and flickered, but no one seemed to notice him. Not with the far end of their camp blown to pieces.\n\nHe had planted the explosive close enough to the fence to damage it, but he hoped no one had been hurt. He had looked for an empty patch as best he could, and sincerely hoped no one had died. These people had explosives. He had seen that by their fireworks they shot off before making sacrifices to their gods. He wasn't afraid of an explosive messing up their history or timeline.\n\nAs he ran, he met no one. Women and children were in hiding, and the men were trying to put out the fire. He ran past houses, all made into a flat roofed shape using the natural stone that had been mined on the volcano nearby. From up there on the volcano, he had estimated it was a quarter mile to where he needed to be, but maybe more. Distance was funny here. Time seemed to go normally, but distance could be tricky. This close to a gate, that wasn't surprising.\n\nAs he ran, it became more apparent it was at least half a mile, maybe more. Sure, it was a lot hotter here, but the advantage was it was at sea level. He lived at altitude, and that made a huge difference here as he kept a near sprint for more than a minute. Then 2 minutes. Then 3.\n\nMaybe it was a full mile before he saw the large temple come into view. For as far off as it appeared, he seemed to get there in only a few short steps. Distance was weird here. But he already expected that. He was pretty sure the temple guards would still be there, and he was certain the priests would be as well. The priests wouldn't resist him. The guards? To the death.\n\nThere were only 2 guards out front, and one fell to a rock from his sling, and the other retreated into the temple as that happened. He would deal with her later, maybe. He found it somewhat odd that all the temple guards here were females. The retreat wasn't a surprising move, though. An explosion, then a guard knocked out cold out of nowhere. Yes, this looked like an attack. He was sure he hadn't been seen by now, but that was about to end.\n\nThere was no way to sneak up the temple stairs, but he still avoided running up the middle of them, clinging to the right side of the staircase as he climbed. It was about 30 stairs to the top, and from there, he could really see the purple glow he had hoped for. Crouching below the top of the stairs, he peeked over, looking for the gate.\n\nThere, about 50 meters inside the enormous temple, was a glowing purple....not a hole...because holes are in the ground. But a hole...in the air. To the left of it was clearly there, and to the right as well...but where the hole was...it was just...a glowing purple. He saw a few priests in the temple, but he never saw the other guard. He didn't have time to wait for her to show, though he was sure she was hidden, and watchful in there. Waiting.\n\nHe took a sip of water from a water skin, and prepared to run. \n\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nAnd that's where you come in.\n\nAs you can tell, I'm wanting to do a little bit of multiverse, possibly time travel, RP. My character finds himself on this world, needing to get through this gate to another world. What's there? Who's there? We can make that up as we go!\n\nWho are you? Are you the temple guard who happened to grab me as I fell into the hole, and the next world over? Are you a temple sacrifice who takes advantage of my distraction, or maybe another world traveler, who by chance, happened to be there right as I was?\n\nI'm interested in longer responses that may come a little slower, and not so much discord, back and forth responses.\n\nSo, if you're interested in taking the leap through that gate, and finding out who I am, and where it goes, then send me a message, and we can make this happen!",

If you\u2019ve messaged me before feel free to do it again, my life has got hectic recently and I lost some people along the way. So what am I looking for exactly you may wonder? \n\nI\u2019m currently looking for only female x female pairings. This is non negotiable.\n\nI am definitely looking for quality over quantity type of writing. If you can express everything in a detailed and nice manner in a paragraph then that works for me. That being said if you write several paragraphs I will do my best to match that and expect you to do the same. I understand that some scenes require less than others might and we can totally just play it by ear.\n\nI definitely prefer to play long term over short term roleplays. I prefer to get really into my characters and the world we create. \n\nThat being said I like to use a Discord server for roleplaying because I like the separate tabs for different information to keep everything nice and organized as things get bigger.\n\nI post every day, once a day at minimum unless I warn you otherwise in advance. Usually I can generate more replies then that especially if it\u2019s an action scene or something but always at least once. I prefer you to be able to do the same.\n\nLastly, I am a huge fan of OOC chatting. I\u2019m here to make some friends to build a world and story with. So I\u2019ll ramble to you about life, characters, ideas, posts I see that remind me of our story, anything like that. If that\u2019s not your thing please just tell me ahead of time so I don\u2019t talk your ear off. \n\nOn to the actual story! I am looking to play in one of the following ideas or genres in order of interest:\n\n* A bit of a cliche roleplay centering around a down on their luck college student who\u2019s wrapped up in their own little fantasy world who\u2019s suddenly thrown into a different life with new friends, one of whom is your character.\n* A modern slice of life roleplay. Whether this be that they both end up working in the same place, one is the frequent customer at the other\u2019s place of work, or they meet on a dating app. Anything is cool for this one! \n* Always willing to hear your ideas as well!\n\nIf any of this catches your idea please just shoot me a message and we can get going! Hope to hear from you!",

The citizens of New York City begin to riot and destroy the city causing city officials and diplomats to be evacuated. An investigation by CERA has determined that the viral infection was initially spread through United States currency sometime during Black Friday.*\n\n**December 7th, 2015** *The 42nd Infantry Division of the New York Army National Guard is mobilized to restore order to the city. Up to 10,000 are reported to be dead from the Dollar Flu and rioting.*\n\n**December 15th, 2015** *With a lack of food and supplies coming into the city, people have resorted to eating pigeons and local plants for food.*\n\n**December 18th, 2015** *The 42nd Infantry Division retreats from New York City and sets up a Forward Operating Base across the channel in New Jersey.*\n\n**Turbulence - A Division Store**\n\nA clear Winter morning is visible as the sun begins to cast an orange hue on the city that never sleeps. David Welsh sat up in his bed slowly as he let out a long yawn and squinted his eyes over towards the window of his modest apartment. It certainly wasn't anything great, but what else could you afford on a New York Police Officer's salary. Having been stationed here three years prior as a sleeper Strategic Homeland Division agent, he kept the money he was paid from the SHD and sent it back home to his family in Arkansas. \n\n\"Good God,\" he muttered under his breath as he cracked his back and pushed out of bed.\n\nThe slow patter of his bare feet against the hardwood floor echoed out as he began to start his day. Only being 29 years old, he felt more like 60 this beautiful Friday morning. It was Black Friday, and that meant a busy day for all of the New York City Police Department. Fights in progress, theft reports, and probably even a couple of crashes are what his shift would hold. He wasn't looking forward to it, but it made the day fly by.\n\n**Themes:** Actions and Romance\n\n**What I'm looking for in this roleplay:** I am looking for a long term writing partner who would like to write an RP in a somewhat post-apocalyptic New York City. Two sleeper government agents are activated as the city falls into chaos and work to restore order to the city and rescue her citizens from certain destruction.\n\n**Disclaimer:** So, appearently I need to put this up here since I've recieved more than a few messages about this. I will write smut if it fits in the story, but I do not write smut for the sake of writing smut. I have nothing against people who do that, but I don't. Please do not message me with any inappropriate offers, thank you.\n\nA little about me:\n\n* I am a 22 male (**I don't RP with people below the age of 18 due to the mature themes**).\n* I am in the EST timezone.\n* **I prefer a partner who can reply multiple times a day** or at least chat to let me know you're still interested. I totally get life gets in the way sometimes as well!\n* I am a Police Officer, so sometimes my time gets very limited (not that other jobs don't) since I work about from 5 to 6 to 7 days a week, not including doubles I sometimes pull.\n* I like to talk in OOC and plot a lot, so please let me know if you don't want to.\n* I like a lot of drama in my RPs since I feel it keeps the story interesting.\n* I would prefer to RP on discord, but if you have an option you would like to try, I am totally fine with that.\n* I'm pretty easy going, so if you have more to add to the plot or the basic narrative I typed above, please don't hesitate to let me know.\n* I try to keep my posts around 1 - 3 paragraphs, but I can definitely post more if it warrants it.\n* I like to post music with my posts sometimes if I feel there is a need for a dramatic feel in a post. If you don't like that, please let me know beforehand.",

Itching to write your favorite characters in a more collaborative setting than 1x1s (because, come on, two heads are better than one. Hail HYDRA)? Want to try a new character on for size? Trying to find writers closer in age to you? Earth-616.5 might be the right fit for you.\n\nEarth-616.5 is an ***LGBTQIA+ friendly,*** mature (25+), **relaxed/casual,** free-form/prose based RPG server on Discord. A midway point between Earth-616 (the Marvel Comics main continuity) and Earth-199999 (the Marvel Cinematic Universe\u2014post-Black Panther, pre-Infinity War), the characters who inhabit this world are a mix of both their comic book pasts and their on-screen exploits. Their backgrounds, headcanons, and unique characteristics in this world are up to the writer to choose. The idea is to collaborate with other writers on a case-by-case basis to come up with the best version of the character, as the writer sees fit, and then just have fun with it.\n\n*Our ideal member is:*\n\n* any adult over the age of 25;\n* can write at least two literate paragraphs;\n* understands the syntax, conventions, and rules of English;\n* understands that role-play is about having fun, stretching those literary muscles, and getting to discuss (geek out about) some of these characters that we know and love;\n* will be moderately active (15 texts/3 paragraphs x week);\n* isn\u2019t racist, homophobic, transphobic, or ableist;\n* understands boundaries and that the versions of character who may be present at our may or may not be \u2018your\u2019 version;\n* not going to take any of this too seriously. :0)\n\nWe are a small but amazing group, waiting for the rest of our teammates to join up. We have some loose ideas for plot in the future, if the game grows large enough, but for now, we just want to explore some connections between these characters.\n\n***TAKEN CHARACTERS:*** Clint Barton, Francis Barton, Kate Bishop, Jessica Jones, Billy Kaplan, Loki Laufeyson, Peter Parker, Pepper Potts, James Rhodes, Steve Rogers, Tony Stark.\n\n***HIGHLY DESIRED CHARACTERS:*** Thor Odinson, Gwen Stacy, Matt Murdock, Bruce Banner, \u0432 \u043f\u043e\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0445 \u0437\u0438\u043c\u043d\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0441\u043e\u043b\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0430 (Bucky Barnes).\n\n***UNCLAIMED CHARACTERS:*** Bucky Barnes, Natasha Romanoff, T\u2019Challa, Scott Lang, Shuri, Phil Coulson, Vision, Wanda Maximoff, Pietro Maximoff, Kate Bishop, Happy Hogan, Janet van Dyne, Carol Danvers, Erik Killmonger\\*\\*;\n\nScott Summers, Alex Summers, Kurt Wagner, Jean Grey, Logan Howlett, Ororo Munroe, Kitty Pryde, Charles Xavier, Wade Wilson\\*\\*, Ellie Philister, Neena Thurman, Remy LeBeau, Bobby Drake, Warren Worthington, Hank McCoy, Anna Maria, Jubilation Lee, Danielle Moonstar, Raven Darkh\u00f6lme\\*\\*, Tyron Johnson, Tandy Bowen;\n\nMatt Murdock, Luke Cage, Danny Rand, Foggy Nelson, Karen Page, Frank Castle\\*\\*, Patsy Walker;\n\nReed Richards, Susan Storm, Johnny Blaze, Ben Grimm; and everyone else you can think of. :D\n\n\\*\\* - anti-heroes will require a higher level of maturity and understanding of the character so as not to conflict with the overall flow of the game\n\n\\_\\*\\* - anti-heroes, such as Frank Castle or Deadpool, will require a higher level of maturity and understanding of the character so as not to conflict with the overall flow of the game\\_\n\nSo, if this ad has piqued your interest and you\u2019d like to come to spend some time writing with us after work and on the weekends, come check us out: [https://discord.gg/UFZHMyR](https://discord.gg/UFZHMyR)",

            "selftext": "Heyo fellow role playing aficionado! I\u2019ll first warn you that this post is rather long. As seen in the title, I\u2019m looking for some more fantasy in my life. A little bit about me, I\u2019m a 21 year old male in the central time zone. I work full time, usually night shift. That being said, i can usually be on my phone during work allowing me to reply often enough. My reply length varies, depending on what the situation calls for. I\u2019ll always be able to send *at least* a paragraph if we\u2019re doing quick responses/dialogue. Other then that I usually strive for 2 paragraph or more. With the basics out of the way, here\u2019s a few things I\u2019d expect out of you.\n\n- Semi-Literate. This should be obvious for a roleplay group, but I\u2019ll start with it anyway.\n- As I do it, I expect at least a paragraph reply. You don\u2019t have to describe *every little thing* your character does, just use decent descriptions/imagery and I\u2019ll be content!\n- Add your own ideas, let\u2019s discuss! Yes, the ideas listed below are my own. However, that doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t add your own to them. Each idea I tried to keep general and open to change for that reason.\n- OOC chat, OOC chat, OOC chat. I feel like getting to know who I\u2019m sharing my imagination with helps keep the roleplay enjoyable. \n- Be able to reply at least once a day. I am open for most the day, but i know most people can\u2019t so I\u2019m flexible on this. \n- Be open to Romance and occasionally NSFW (smut, but mostly gore/violence/etc.) I enjoy a good, built up romance.\n\n*Fantasy Ideas*\n\n**Tale of 2 Nations** - This is about two nations that were always on the brink of war, until (someone of royalty) of one nation was assassinated by the other nation. My character would be an Assassin-for-hire type. One that sides with neither nation and, you guessed it, the one to go through with the murder.  I have a couple ideas of how to take this, and some more information (who hired to name one) that I\u2019ll save for people interested in talking more about this. \n\n**Anti-Hero** - Set in a fantasy world we would design where magic is common , my character would be powerful Mage who uses a magic seen as \u2018evil\u2019. Going by his idea of fight fire with Fire (or evil magic with equally evil magic) and driven by his own desires to wipe evil out by any means possible. Meaning he doesn\u2019t care for the safety of the general populace, as long as it means he\u2019s killing/destroying what he sees as evil. This nature would cause him to be hotheaded, self opinionated, and sadistic. Maybe your character helps bring him down to Earth, making him more aware that sacrificing others to destroy evil isn\u2019t what a \u2018hero\u2019 would do. Or your character could have similar ideals and group up with mine to defeat evil by any means necessary. \n\n**Send me your Fantasy Ideas!!!** - I\u2019m always open to hear any fantasy ideas the community has to offer. The worst I can say is no!\n\n*Fandom RPs* Each fandom RP I want us to play OCs and the story be mostly non-canon. I don\u2019t really enjoy fandoms if I\u2019m basing everything off the world and characters. I\u2019d rather use them as ideas and create our own. I don\u2019t read the Manga, but I\u2019m caught up on the Anime. It would be recommended you were at least knowledgeable about the anime.\n\n**Tokyo Ghoul** - This could be Ghoul x Human or Ghoul x Ghoul. Don\u2019t have too many ideas for this, but one I\u2019m more excited for. \n\n**My Hero Academia** - Was thinking we could both be fresh out of different high schools. Our characters would be signing with the same hero agency starting as side kicks. This could build a friendly rivalry to push each to get stronger.  \n\nIf you\u2019ve gotten this far, great! Maybe you\u2019ll push a little further. When/if you send me a message, include your favorite color so I know you read it all!",

Preferably it would be multi-paragraph, as I can reach 6+ paragraphs or drop down to 2-3 if things have slowed down. Decent use of punctuation, grammar and capitalization would be great, too.\n\nNow that all of the boring stuff is out of the way, I've been recently getting back into Bruce Wayne/Batman as I've been replaying the games, watching the films and reading a lot of the comics. I'd love to play Bruce Wayne in a roleplay against another canon, or an OC. Though I prefer canon characters, I'm more than willing to make an exception to that rule. \n\nAside from the Batman stuff;\n\nI also enjoy many many other fandoms such as Marvel (more specifically Spider-Man) and can play Peter Parker, Miles Morales, Luke Cage, Danny Rand, Matthew Murdock, Frank Castle, T'Challa, Thor Odinson and Steve Rogers. \n\nThe other video games I enjoy are...\n\nGod of War\n\nRed Dead Redemption\n\nOverwatch\n\nHalo\n\nThe Elder Scrolls\n\nSplinter Cell\n\nDestiny\n\nBorderlands\n\nFar Cry\n\n\nDevil May Cry and many more!

Include your favourite holiday of the year if you do please; even better if you include plot ideas or your own Discord to contact you!*",

Most of humanity resides in complex tunnel systems or sewers.

They are powerful in technology and their numbers are low.\n\nThe TRA (The Research Alliance) is a faction similar to the USRTF, however, they are more peaceful and tend to work on gaining trust from the people and working for the better cause. They are powerful in the number of people they have, they are not technologically advanced.\n\nThe USRTF and the TRA are at war due to conflicting interests.\n\nMost cities are decayed and are filled with patches of \u2018The Haze\u2019.\u00a0\n\nIt is easy to tell when haze patches are around due to their fluorescent orange color when the wind changes directions or is blowing hard.

            "selftext": "First of all, a bit about me. I am an experienced, mature RPer who has a number of years of experience in different formats, including face-to-face, email, forums and the like. Primarily, I am interested in character interaction and development, especially through storytelling, conversation and relationship building. I like to see well developed, well thought out and believable characters. I prefer exotic or unusual settings, primarily science fiction, cyberpunk or post-apocalyptic. \u201cReal world/slice of life\u201d scenarios aren\u2019t that interesting to me; if it's something like a military or espionage setting, maybe, but not something 'mundane'. With that being said, I\u2019m open to ideas if they\u2019re original or creative or a little unusual.\n\nI generally like well-written, well thought out posts, and definitely prefer quality over quantity. I don\u2019t want to read a novel with each post, but I don\u2019t want to see one-line-wonders. Similarly, I am a stickler for grammar and spelling and punctuation, although I am prone to the odd bout of ferocious typos myself. However, as long as the intent is there, then I\u2019m happy.\n\nMy interests lie in mutual storytelling and creativity, rather than playing along to somebody else\u2019s story or the like. I control my character, I decide what\u2019s going on with them, I create their background and so on. I ask for my partners to respect that, as I will do the same for them. Likewise, I will never launch a major story element or a plot twist or the like without okaying it with a partner, as I would expect them to do the same for me. If I do something a partner doesn't want, then I'll gladly change it, but I ask that they will do the same for me.\n\nI\u2019m flexible as to settings and backgrounds. I am currently looking for **Sci-Fi**, **Cyberpunk** and **Post-Apocalyptic** RP in original settings. I am also interested in fandom RPs based on **Star Wars**, **Battletech/Mechwarrior, Shadowrun** and **Fallout**. I am **only** looking for one-on-one RP, not groups\n\nIf you are interested, please contact me by **PM**. I will not reply to messages posted here or chat requests",

However, it wasn't seamless for all of them; due to discrimination, many mutants turned to crime and villainy. Those who were too dangerous from birth were turned over to become wards of the state, used as tools to accomplish the good of the nation.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u2022 One of the few superhero servers with primarily literate and adv literate level writers.  \u2022 Explore a seedy underground crime filled LA.  \n\n\u2022 Design custom powers with which you can entertain new and interesting roleplay. \n\n \u2022 Find a place where people love to help you improve your writing.

But right now, I\u2019m mostly interested in historical settings (the 20th century, but the 1940s/World War II in particular). It\u2019s not a requirement, but I\u2019d like to include a romantic element if possible. I\u2019m also really interested in a potential horror scenario inspired by Lovecraft. I\u2019m 18+ and can do NSFW scenarios, just as long as it actually benefits the characters and/or plot. My replies tend to be shorter, around 1-2 paragraphs, I hope that won\u2019t be a problem.

            "selftext": "Hello, lovely people.  I decided to write a separate prompt for another one of Gotham's lovely sirens. Another notable omission from Batman Beyond was the luscious and lethal, Pamela Isley. It makes me think about what Ivy would have been up to during the age of Neo-Gotham, a place with little to offer in the way of flora. I'd like to explore Ivy's return to Gotham and her reaction to its many changes. Of course, she would catch the attention of Gotham's newest Dark Knight, Terry McGinnis.\n\n I would also like to explore the dynamic between Terry and Pamela. I feel that Terry's own criminal past gives him a unique perspective on Ivy and her goals. He could definitely understand and respect her goals, but want to avoid the loss of life. It would definitely create a lot of tension, and possibly even bloom into a romance. \n\nMoving on to the boring rules part of the post, I'd like for my partners to be detailed. I average about 300-400 words per reply, and would like for a partner that could respond within a similar range. I'm also not really interested in roleplaying with any OCs, sorry. Finally, I ask that my partners be fine with mature themes. \n\nif you're interested, go ahead and send me a message. I'm also open to roleplaying against another Gotham gal like Black Canary, Barbara Gordon, Catwoman, Harley Quinn, Stephanie Brown, Cassandra Cain, Carrie Kelly, Misfit, Rose Wilson, Max Gibson, Ten, Dana Tan, or Huntress.",

            "selftext": "Hey, guys! I'm looking for a long term roleplay partner. I'm 26 years old and I've been roleplaying for 13 years.  I'm looking for someone close to my age, but at least over 20, since the most fun rps have mature themes. When I have a favorite rp partner, I stick to them for months to years--only a falling out in friendship stops the story.\n\nAbout me:\n\n* I've either done the thing or seen the thing done, so pretty much nothing in rp bothers me.  Bring on the suggestive and the gory! \n* I am an impulsive writer, I don't make my characters do things, I write what they want to do--so detail planning things is wasted effort because 50/50 chance they will sabotage all plans. On the bright side, it makes them more realistic. \n* I prefer making male characters since that's what I'm used to, but I can make female characters if I'm properly inspired. I also prefer m/m, but I'm okay with m/f for side characters. I have never done f/f before so I have no opinion on it. \n* I can make characters so fast it's almost embarrassing. The more characters in an rp, the better! \n* I write multi-para to novella (1.5k to 3k+ words). The more inspired I am, the more I write--but I write less than 1k (0.7 - 0.8) if there is nothing going on. I will not respond if I'm bored. If I'm bored and I don't expect to get over it, I'll let you know. I am okay with my rp partner not mirroring me, but if you write less than 600 words I will get bored fast, no matter how great your writing is. \n* I write in 3rd person attached, with multiple POVs separated if I have more than one character in a scene and their POV is important/relevant.\n* Genres: fantasy (including modern), supernatural, romance, slice of life/family (in moderation), action (**not** sparring), adventure, sci-fi, world building, apocalyptic, post-apocalyptic, and horror (sometimes)\n* Super duper extremely literate! Jk, I make mistakes and don't proof read sometimes, but I have been in the game long enough to know what I'm doing and be somewhat picky about what I receive. \n* I only use OCs, I *do not* Fandom RP and I *will not* Fandom RP.\n* I prefer email but I guess everyone likes discord so I'll do that too.\n* I respond daily, often multiple times a day, and I will tell you if I can't respond on one day (like if I have a date or something idk.).\n* None of my characters are human. I **hate** making human characters, I will not do it! Some of my characters are OP (because of stuff and things in the RL past), if rping with them happens, fighting them is not allowed because that's kinda not fair. I hate sparring period, but still.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat I'm looking for in you!:\n\n* 20+, and okay with **super** mature themes. (Like, seriously, if you have triggers I'm probably not a good fit, because some things that can trigger people at the very least will be mentioned if it's part of a character's backstory. I don't wanna do that to you.)\n* Have a firm grasp on grammar, and able to write more than 600 words.\n* Able to juggle more than one character. (I'm sorry, but you're going to get overwhelmed if you have one character and I have, like five. Also, I've done this imbalanced thing before and it's also really boring for me... No one watches tv or reads a book with only one character present the entire time, you know?)\n* I'd love you to prefer m/m, but it's not mandatory. You have to definitely be comfortable with it.\n* Able to respond daily. Matching how frequently I respond is preferred but you don't have to!\n* Have a healthy (or unhealthy, who am I to judge) obsession with shipping like me.\n* Able to write in 3rd person and juggle multiple povs.\n* Be a really cool person! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do not have \"rl\" faceclaims... I like to draw, so if I want to see my character I'll draw them. But I was a weeb, so my style is pretty anime-ish, apparently some people don't like that? I'm not really interested in changing that about me. Sometimes I'll go on a search if there's a specific outfit I can't describe properly, but that's it. Idc if you use rl people as faceclaims, I just won't want to do it.\n\nPlease don't message me questioning why I haven't done f/f.... people did that last time. :(\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIF YOU READ ALL OF THIS THANK YOU! GO OUT AND BUY YOURSELF A COOKIE, YOU EARNED IT!",

(Keep in mind I just started and it'll likely take me months to finish it)\n\nI really would like to find a literate, 21+ rp partner to play around with my completely confused but utterly curious and determinate Link! Maybe your character knows exactly what's happening and gently leads Link into remembering and then working towards the ultimate goal. Maybe your character is just as oblivious and they find out together what their destiny holds. I'd honestly love any! If you have any different ideas, I'd also love to hear them.\n\nI should say I love OOC and would love to find a partner who likes to build stories as much as I do. Detail is very appreciated.\n\nPM me!",

If you\u2019ve messaged me before feel free to do it again, my life has got hectic recently and I lost some people along the way. So what am I looking for exactly you may wonder? \n\nI\u2019m currently looking for only female x female pairings. This is non negotiable.\n\nI am definitely looking for quality over quantity type of writing. If you can express everything in a detailed and nice manner in a paragraph then that works for me. That being said if you write several paragraphs I will do my best to match that and expect you to do the same. I understand that some scenes require less than others might and we can totally just play it by ear.\n\nI definitely prefer to play long term over short term roleplays. I prefer to get really into my characters and the world we create. \n\nThat being said I like to use a Discord server for roleplaying because I like the separate tabs for different information to keep everything nice and organized as things get bigger.\n\nI post every day, once a day at minimum unless I warn you otherwise in advance. Usually I can generate more replies then that especially if it\u2019s an action scene or something but always at least once. I prefer you to be able to do the same.\n\nLastly, I am a huge fan of OOC chatting. I\u2019m here to make some friends to build a world and story with. So I\u2019ll ramble to you about life, characters, ideas, posts I see that remind me of our story, anything like that. If that\u2019s not your thing please just tell me ahead of time so I don\u2019t talk your ear off. \n\nOn to the actual story! I am looking to play in one of the following ideas or genres in order of interest:\n\n* Critical Role Roleplay with their characters in the game. I have a lot of ideas for this and would absolutely love giving it a shot.\n* A modern slice of life roleplay. Whether this be that they both end up working in the same place, one is the frequent customer at the other\u2019s place of work, or they meet on a dating app. Anything is cool for this one! \n* Always willing to hear your ideas as well!\n\nIf any of this catches your idea please just shoot me a message and we can get going! Hope to hear from you!",
