If you wanna message me to get some more detail on my writing style, expectations, and more then feel free to. I\u2019ll respond to all messages that I see! \n\nA little bit about what I\u2019m interested in: \n\nRight now I\u2019m feeling a mix between dark and gritty and cute and fluffy! Either way would be super fun to me. However, I will warn that even if you want to do something romantic and cute then I will expect some nsfw aspects as it is a normal part of most adults lives! \nI prefer to stay on the realistic side but there are some exceptions that I\u2019m willing to make! Other than that I\u2019d say I\u2019m super go with the flow. I have several ideas that I\u2019d love to share and I\u2019m sure that some of you have ideas that you\u2019d like to share as well! \nI use both kik and discord to roleplay, but I do prefer kik! I\u2019m in EST time zone as well, just to get that bit of information out there for everyone. \n\nHope to hear from some of you and I will be responding to every single message that I receive!

I've posted in this subreddit many times, and have had luck most of the time.  This time I'm seeking a partner for a plot that I have never explored before. The plot is loosely based around the idea of two individuals (likely opposites; i.e working girl &amp; outlawed cowboy) coming together, falling in love and defeating all odds against them to stay together. I would say the timeline that this story could take place any period between the 1790s - 1910s. All elements of the story can and most likely will include mature themes. Please ask me about them in advance when you PM me in case you're wary. I would love to have a partner who I can keep a casual conversation with OOC as well as a serious one IC. I love to chat and get to know my partners personally, so please don't be afraid to open up! \n\nPlease be ready to brainstorm ideas for our story, and bonus points if you've already created an OC!

It hosts a variety of activities throughout the year, and boasts a friendly community where most families know one other at least by name or face. However, it's history is that of being a safe haven for supernatural beings and humans alike - a place where witches came to escape the trials of the Northeast, and where powerful descendants of angels and demons found their homes. \n\nIt was founded by the Bellmare family and still run by them today, though muddled rumors of this family harboring hatred against those of supernatural kind have run rampant over the course of the town's history for many decades - even still today it is not uncommon for a family or two to mysteriously go 'missing' with no trace. \n\nHowever, the normal human citizens of the town have also been reported to have attacks on them, found injured or left for dead. Though the influx of new families are fewer than before, it raises the questions of darker beings having found their way in to exact revenge. \n\nCurrently, it is summer time in Bellmare, the students have either graduated or are on their break, and though many just want to have a normal summer, there are some who may be determined to figure the horrors of the town out, ones that the Bellmare family does anything to keep hidden. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's a glance at our open roles;\n\nWitches; 4/4 roles open (powered, able to conjured and cast spells and have great spiritual connection)\n\nDemons; 4/4 roles open (powered, have abilities of fire/shadows/dark magic/telekinesis)\n\nAngels; 4/4 roles open (powered, have abilities of light/wind/teleportation/healing - 'wind' gifts them a temporary set of wings) \n\nBellmare children; 2/3 roles open (hold hidden family secrets, can be 'good' or 'bad', 15 years or older) \n\nNormal humans; unlimited. also must be 15 years or older.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease DM me for the link, thank you OwO",

            "selftext": "Hello all! I've decided to go on a hunt for some roleplay partners. First, a bit about myself. \n\nI am a 20 year old girl who loves to create characters of all kinds and act out roleplays that are funny, romantic, and worth the time invested. While I do have my moments of business or tiredness, I am pretty free most the time. I roleplay in 3rd Person and my personal favorite genres are slice of life and/or modern fantasy mixed with romance. I'm not too picky on length but my comfort zone is 2-15+ lines depending on my level of creativity and how much the other person puts out. I do prefer LGBT roleplays although I can do straight roleplays. I prefer our characters to be able to change out on the who wears the pants role or for me to be the lesser pants wearer. Most of my characters are less masculine  or ambiguous. EST Time Zone.\nNow onto preferences for my partner. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMUSTS: \n\nMust be willing and able to have or create a decently fleshed out character. I have a character template that I use for my ocs if you need one. Character tropes are fine, although I take some issue with some but as long as they go beyond that trope and are their own person beyond 1 or 2 character traits, they're fine!\n\nMust have decent grammar and spelling. Now I know nobody's grammar or spelling is perfect, but I need to be able to understand what you're typing. \n\nMust reply at least every other day. I understand being busy and having times where you can't reply for a few days but id like to be notified if and when those things happen. I usually wait 4-7 days for someone to reply and will send the occasional 'hi' or 'hey' as a reminder. (Note: I also encourage you to be annoying to get me to reply. Sometimes I get distracted to the point of forgetting to reply or Discord won't send my reply or won't notify me when you reply. Send me reminders. If I ghost you it's never on purpose.) \n\nMUST NOT GHOST. I get being busy or even not wanting to roleplay with me. LET ME KNOW. So many people tend to ghost  when They get busy or dont want to tell me that they're not feeling me or the roleplay. Tell me. That way I know and can have a little closure. \n\nHave Discord.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEXTRA POINTS IF (you do not have to share these but it helps if you do)\n\nYou roleplay LGBT\n\nYou like multiple RPs, multiple characters to be going on at once (I LOVE polyamory)\n\nYou like talking and developing the RP as its happening\n\nYou are okay with rping as/with ocs who are mentally ill or physically disabled in some way. \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSend me a message telling me about you, what you like/don't like in a roleplay, and if you hit any of the extra points!  If you messaged me and I didn't answer I was probably busy! Feel free to Send me another message! I look forward to role-playing with you!! Please send the keyphrase \"Don't ask Don't Pas-tell\" somewhere in your message so I know you read through everything",

I\u2019m a 21 year old female looking for anyone 20-27 that can play a male character whether you\u2019re actually male, female, non-binary, etc. it doesn\u2019t matter to me what you are in real life. All my plots are safe for work. I do NOT write smut. My roleplays typically focus on drama and romance with a hint of action depending on the role. I am pretty much advanced lit. Writing anywhere from a couple to multiple paragraphs. I also only write in third person. Please be creative. DM me if interested. All \u2018hi\u2019s and \u2018hey\u2019s will be ignored. Here\u2019s a whole list of roleplays I currently do:\n\n\n*The Wolves* Many years ago a young girl was attacked by a pack of wolves in a place where wolves aren\u2019t common. A twist on your cliche werewolf story.\n\n*The Contract* the two top young rising celebrities don\u2019t get along at all, for various reasons. What happens when their managers go behind their backs and set the two up on a date? Forcing them to sign a six month contract , claiming to be a couple in the public eye. \n\n*Faking It* A young girl is making her way through life by stripping at a high end club for business men. She has a regular visitor that spends much more on her in an hour than most do the entire night. She practically only comes into work for him. But what happens when he\u2019s told he can only further his career in his family\u2019s company by settling down? He\u2019s been lying about having a girlfriend for years...\n\n*The Selection* A slight futuristic twist on your modern day Bachelor/Bachelorette reality tv show. Involves royals, rebels and so much more.\n\n*Fandoms* we can discuss Avatar the Last Airbender, Star Wars, and Harry Potter",

Before we get started I'd like to lay down some ground rules:\n\n- Be 18+. I'm over 20 and I like to include NSFW themes in my roleplays so only people over the legal age limit. \n- Be semi literate at least. I want quality in your posts, and no one liners if at all possible. I don't mind spelling/grammar mistakes. I'm certainly not perfect either but I want to be able to understand what you're writing. \n- I want someone decently active. A post a day would be great. I understand life happens, I work a full time job, but I just dont want someone who takes a week to reply. \n- This isnt a must but I love chatting OOC. So if you love that too even better!!\n\nAlright! As for genres I'm pretty much up for anything at the moment. I've been digging fantasy related things lately but it's not a must. If you've got an idea then swing it my way. I am also open to Harry Potter roleplays but only if it's a Draco x Harry pairing. Also, as per the title I'm looking for an MxM pairing in any roleplay we do. I rarely do MxF and may do FxF if you've got a good plot. \n\nWith all of that said send me a PM! Tell me a bit about yourself and what you're looking for. I wont respond to messages that just ask if I'm anti interested. Hope to hear from some of you!!",

I am officially on my vacation from work !Though my ads for M x M roleplays received a lot of interest, the role players started to fade away. I\u2019m hoping to find some long-term, active people ready to make an amazing story together! I have been feeling really down, and this is just the pick me up I need!\n\nI am very open to what we do. It can be original, fandom, modern, fantasy! Run it by me, and I\u2019ll most likely give it a shot! Bonus points if you do fandoms, since I don\u2019t have any going at the moment. \n\n1. Please be literate! No bad grammar or text talk! Third person only!\n\n2. Please be reasonably active. No ghosting. I realize life gets busy, however if you only reply once in a blue moon, I am not for you. Please communicate if you\u2019ll be away for a long period of time (I will understand and do the same). \n\n3. You must be 19+. I will not roleplay with anyone younger than nineteen, no exceptions. \n\n4. I do not use a set stock of characters. I always make a character specifically to a plot. For roleplaying with me, please do the same. I respect if you have your own already, I\u2019m just not one for inserting one character into every plot. Please be okay with this. \n\nI welcome people of all gender expressions, and also check out my other ads too! Thank you for reading and I hope to hear from you soon! Please feel free to shoot me PM if any of this interested you!",

            "selftext": "Hello community! Yes, the title is true; role-play is my source of escape and relax from this thing called life. I'm not exactly sure what to put in this posting so...I guess a small introduction is needed?\n\nI'm a 24 year old female who has been role-playing for a while now. I started on the anonymous app, Whisper, a few years ago, but I wrote my first crossover/OC character story in 2008 based on Naruto and the Twilight saga. I enjoy writing and creating a story with another person, finding the happy medium for both of us. Currently, I go to community college for a second degree in public health while holding a BA in Psychology. What I'll do after that is...eh. Who really knows?\n\nWith role-play, I lean towards romantic/slice of life/drama genres. I like these genres just because they resemble closest to things that can happen in real life. Favorite roles would have to be ones where the guy is older and more mature roles. Ones that value the story over the NSFW parts. The build up and the tension, the drama and what happens to pull the two characters closer are more important to me over the NSFW or smut sections. \n\nWith that said, I'm not completely against NSFW elements in a role-play, but it is weighted heavily below everything else involved. I tend to role-play in first person, present tense, but I do want to try and get used to role-playing in third person, past tense as it seems many others do the same. I can (and probably will be) very detailed, yet I do not expect it from my partner so long as the length of the response is enough to work with. \n\nI think I've said enough! Thank you to those who read this all the way through! I have role-play ideas that I'm willing to share or we can talk about other ideas and compromise. You can either private message me or send me a chat message where I can share my Discord or Kik username.  \n\nHappy Role-playing!",

If only the nurses had noticed the strange, sharp teeth..\n\n2.)

A little company cant hurt, right? So long as he avoids the full moon. \n\n3.)

Or we worked in the same vicinity, at least. 5\u20192. Studious notetaker. I had blue hair at the time?\n\nAnyways, I\u2019ve heard about how swamped your team is lately, so I thought I\u2019d give you a heads up. There\u2019s a new case coming in and I\u2019ve been told you\u2019ll be assigned to it (me too. I\u2019m on physicals. Hence the howdy partner.) You\u2019ll be *officially* informed tomorrow, but what\u2019s a little leaked sensitive information between acquaintances, right?\n\nSeriously though, I\u2019m kind of risking my butt to start us out on the right foot here. Please don\u2019t snitch.\n\nI haven\u2019t been told much if I\u2019m honest, but I did get the initial interview (coughinterrogationcough) transcripts and the footage. I can attach them if you\u2019d like? Get back to me soon.\n\nLooking forward to working with you,\n\nMyra.\\]\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nMyra worked her fingers through her hair, massaging the aching scalp and looming tension headache that her tight ponytail had earned her. *I should have been home two hours ago.* The Foundation\u2019s logo glowed out at her from the home screen of her work laptop. It was the only real light in the dim breakroom she\u2019d holed herself up in; everyone else on her shift had been smart enough to leave as soon as the clock hit that magic number.\n\nShe flicked the cursor over the email again. She had watched the video twice already, but the urge to keep watching itched at her badly. Myra sucked the powdered sugar remnants of a donut from her thumb.\n\nOnce more couldn\u2019t hurt.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n*Hey! If you're interested in playing a researcher or security interacting with a humanoid SCP, please respond to the first half of the prompt. If you're interested in playing the SCP who gets to know their nurse, please respond to the second half! Hope to hear from you.*",

            "selftext": "First of all, a bit about me. I am an experienced, mature RPer who has a number of years of experience in different formats, including face-to-face, email, forums and the like. Primarily, I am interested in character interaction and development, especially through storytelling, conversation and relationship building. I like to see well developed, well thought out and believable characters. I prefer exotic or unusual settings, primarily science fiction, cyberpunk or post-apocalyptic. \u201cReal world/slice of life\u201d scenarios aren\u2019t that interesting to me; if it's something like a military or espionage setting, maybe, but not something 'mundane'. With that being said, I\u2019m open to ideas if they\u2019re original or creative or a little unusual.\n\nI generally like well-written, well thought out posts, and definitely prefer quality over quantity. I don\u2019t want to read a novel with each post, but I don\u2019t want to see one-line-wonders. Similarly, I am a stickler for grammar and spelling and punctuation, although I am prone to the odd bout of ferocious typos myself. However, as long as the intent is there, then I\u2019m happy.\n\nMy interests lie in mutual storytelling and creativity, rather than playing along to somebody else\u2019s story or the like. I control my character, I decide what\u2019s going on with them, I create their background and so on. I ask for my partners to respect that, as I will do the same for them. Likewise, I will never launch a major story element or a plot twist or the like without okaying it with a partner, as I would expect them to do the same for me. If I do something a partner doesn't want, then I'll gladly change it, but I ask that they will do the same for me.\n\nI\u2019m flexible as to settings and backgrounds. I am currently looking for **Sci-Fi**, **Cyberpunk** and **Post-Apocalyptic** RP in original settings. I am also interested in fandom RPs based on **Star Wars**, **Battletech/Mechwarrior, Shadowrun** and **Fallout**. I am **only** looking for one-on-one RP, not groups\n\nIf you are interested, please contact me by **PM**. I will not reply to messages posted here or chat requests",

            "selftext": "Hey there. I'm looking for someone to create an amazing, gripping story with. The main theme I like to play is romance but we can also add different elements into it if you wish. Please note though, fantasy is a big no! I would really appreciate it if you were reliable, and tell me if it got boring because then it's fair. If you ghost me, don\u2019t expect a sudden second chance. Of course we will both have our own personal lives but I\u2019ll always communicate healthily and let you know when I\u2019m busy. If you're going to message, be serious about this too and have a clear idea about what you want. I can do first or third person, I can change my preference if needs to be. Honestly, I will NOT accept one liners nor will I respond back to you if you're just gonna ghost. I've had enough of people just coming along for short-term purposes when this is LONG term. I cannot stress that enough.\n\nMy list:\n\n\\~Friends from childhood.\n\n\\~Roommates.\n\n\\~Nurse and Solider/veteran.\n\n\\~Prince/Princess falls for a village girl/boy.\n\n\\~Friends with benefits\n\n\\~Rich Entrepreneur and interior designer.\n\n\\~Gang member and innocent girl.\n\n\\~Strangers\n\nAnd of course, any other ideas you wish to tell me about. Yes I know these are mildly clich\u00e8, so I\u2019m willing to spice them up and add a lot more angst, or even some dark themes if it does fit with the idea. \n\nSmut will have a very small element in this, but it won't be too overpowering as I want to enjoy the story at its fullest - so it will be discussed fully once the plot has been established and there will always be a good build-up before any NSFW. When it happens though, I'll make sure to attend to your every need. I cannot stress this enough; Please be literate! (more than a paragraph at least). If you deliver on that, I will too. Roleplay is a two way mutual thing and it has to flow in order to keep a story going. \n\nThanks for reading! I use Reddit and kik. If you have any other platform, I\u2019ll be sure to download it if I can but I really do prefer the two I\u2019ve mentioned.",

            "selftext": "1000 years after the events of Dragon Ball Super, Goku and company are long gone. However, their impact on the galaxy and even the universe has turned it into quite the busy place. For one, the descendants of the Frieza Force have formed an even greater superpower know as the Arcosian Empire. As greedy and powerful as they are, there is one organization standing in their way; the Universal Federation. This group was formed by Earthlings and Saiyans alike with the goal of protecting the universe from evil.\n\nBut make no mistake; these two mega-monopolies aren\u2019t the only threats in Universe 7. The Wanderer\u2019s Pledge, which is a group of space pirates more than 500,000 members strong, have been testing the waters recently, seeing what they can and can\u2019t get away with. The Continuum Covenant has been struggling as well; although their religion of Kai and other deity worship is still the primary faith across the universe, there are rumors of a group rising to oppose them, wanting to shift the balance of power into their favor.\n\nDespite all of these big players, our story doesn\u2019t focus on any of them entirely; it\u2019s focusing on you, a beginner-level fighter trying to become more powerful and make a name for yourself. In DBZ: Fight for the Future, you\u2019ll take on missions, hunt down valuable treasures, and rise to greatness just as those before you have. But beware; not everything in the universe is as straightforward as it seems. Sometimes the real threat lurks above...or below.\n\nThis RP is a literate DBZ role play heavily inspired by D&amp;D. It takes the classic feel of Dragon Ball and incorporates most of the typical D&amp;D elements you know and love. With a variety of classes to choose from, a selection of the best races from the show, and plenty of transformations and abilities to unlock, you can construct your ideal Dragon Ball character and choose whatever role you want to play. You can use classic moves from the show, or even make up your own to fit your play style and use on your enemies! If you\u2019re interested, click the link below!\n\nhttps://discord.gg/Vm6UHjW",

I do find it easier to RP with other females most of the time, but that's not a rule.\n\nBefore I get into the plot, I'll go into the boring stuff:\n\n\\-18+, 21+ is even more preferred.\n\n\\- Discord only. I don't RP anywhere else these days.\n\n\\- Third person only\n\n\\- Quality over quantity. I don't want one liners, but I don't want every post to be a book, either.\n\n\\- Relatively active, and looking for someone who is also active. One post a day is the bare minimum. Things happen in real life, and that's totally fine, just let me know, please. Someone who can make a few posts a day is even better, but that's not totally necessary.\n\n\\- NSFW. This is **NOT** necessary to be in the RP, we can fade to black, ect. But it's not unwelcome. Regardless, smut will never be the focus...That should be a given by now.\n\n\\-OOC chat. I like to talk to my RP partner, weather it's related to the RP or not, so someone who also does that is welcome.\n\nI think that about covers it, so onto the RP its self:\n\nI'm totally willing to collaborate and exchange ideas for this, as most of it isn't super set in stone.\n\nMy character is going to be a full fledged medium. ie; can see, talk to, and interact with spirits and such.\n\nYour character is totally up to you. Weather they're a medium as well, a 'ghost hunter' or other kind of paranormal investigator type deal, or just someone who is fascinated by the idea. Maybe they're just a regular person who gets caught up in it. It's up to you, really, and I'm not going to be too particular on what you do with your character. They are your character, after all.  \nHowever, for the sake of my characters' preferences, it would be better if your character isn't the androgynous type. My character prefers the more manly type. Doesn't have to be some big burly guy, but you get my drift, hopefully.\n\nI want this to be a slice of life/romance of sorts, but obviously, given the nature of my character, things that are normal for him, aren't exactly quotidian for the average person. I have more details about my character, but won't go into all of that here. He's an older character of mine, who I've revived, redesigned, and have been wanting to use again recently.\n\nSo, if you're looking for a semi-spooky, strange, and even kooky fun type of slice of life/romance RP, and made it this far, you came to the right place.  \nDM me with some info about yourself, and we can have a chat.",

            "selftext": "***All content in the post below is intended for ages 18 and above, aka 18+.***\n\n**This  will be a persistent request I will repost on a near-regular basis. I  don't check Reddit often during the day, but I check it daily. Whoever I  am playing with, do not take it personally. It's just habit.**\n\nFirst, a few things about myself.\n\n33  years old, Eastern Time Zone U.S.A. (GMT -4 for international folks),  full time weekday worker (the whole 40 hours and more). Craving RP with  any and all interested.\n\n*Please  don't be discouraged by everything here. Some things did require more  context to make sense, especially The Catch section. The best we can do  is try with each other. :)*\n\n***Basic Requirements and Options***\n\nThird person RP only, Discord is a must because my computer AND phone use it.\n\nWhat  I seek is female characters (IRL gender does NOT matter) opposite any  of my males/females/anything in between. In what, you may ask? Look  below (anything in bold is a big want with me):\n\n\\-Modern (includes fantasy, **slice of life, drama. I love the whole \"love, marriage, baby carriage\" angle in any relationship I do in a story**).\n\n\\-Historical (**Medieval (vikings/Norse/Saxon/Crusades/Plantagenet/Tudors era**), Victorian/Wild West eras, **1940s/1950s/1960s play**)\n\n\\-Fantasy (this goes into either of the genres above)\n\n\\-Fandoms (Marvel/DC, Once Upon a Time, **Star Wars**, **Game of Thrones aka A Song of Ice and Fire**, Peaky Blinders, **Harry Potter/Fantastic Beasts/Wizarding World,** Vikings, The Last Kingdom, The Boys; **Persona 5**; Others are open to ask on. Canon characters are a big toss up, so ask on them if you come my way asking to play someone. Bring a few ideas if I say no, just in case.\n\n***Writing and RP Style***\n\nAs  for visuals, I have gotten dependent on them. Superficial, lacking  imagination on images? It is. But I've played in public SLs over the  years who have regularly embraced them, so it's ingrained on me.  Usually, actors/actresses/models and the occasional art.\n\nI  favor adult writing and want the same from who I play with. No FADE TO  BLACK. PERIOD. Give me the romantic, intimate, and everything beyond it  in detail (those that know what this means will get it :) ). I also  enjoy players who like to talk OOC.\n\n***The catch?***\n\nI got it down to three simple statements:\n\n1. Because  I work full time, my availability will vary. I will have periods where I  want to grind out a bunch of posts or ideas, and times where RL will  take priority. Nevertheless I am on every day on Discord. I love players  that are on daily or near daily, least to play if not talk.\n2. I  love those who are open minded or don't let anything bother them. If I  say or do something that you don't agree with, then just say so. I know I  will, and we can either work it out or move on.\n3. I  don't want to deal with any ghosters or flaky people. If we work out an  idea together, whether I contact you or vice versa, I want to stay on  top of things with you as much as possible. If RL comes up and you have  to go, I get it if you let me know. On the other hand, if things go  abruptly quiet and I don't hear from you for a week, I move on. I  definitely encourage someone messaging me later to try again, though.\n\n***Conclusion***\n\nFeel  free to PM me for my Discord name or offer yours (with the 4 digit  number at the end) when you message (no need to wait!). I apologize for  the long winded post, but it's the best I can do. **Any interested folks who PM me, please throw in a \"marvelous\" somewhere so I know my post was read rather than the title**. :) I look forward to meeting everyone!\n\n***All content in the post above is intended for ages 18 and above, aka 18+.***",

            "selftext": " \n\nFirst off. I am MJ. I was made in the 80s and this means I can remember AOL dialup3.0 and role playing turn based style back when online RP was invented. Yes, I\u2019m a relic. But, I am also a take-no-prisoners hilarious witch with a heart of gold. And I love to tell a good story. And I think I\u2019ve got a really good idea, and I think it will be fun.\n\nI want to write this story with two friends of mine. We\u2019ve all been doing this for a while, so no typical Mary-Sue doe eyed boring characters here. We like complex, we like dark, we like gritty, we like a little blood and spit sometimes. So you should probably be pretty ok with some mature themes and elements. (we are also pretty chill and love to talk ooc and have collaborated on storylines before and we just have a good time and nerd-out over our little universe we have created.)\n\nSo I\u2019m looking for someone who can write a badass vampire on Discord. I\u2019m talking modern day New Orleans has a vampire. He should be written by someone who:\n\n\\-Will never mention anything related to the Twilight franchise ever. I am serious, it was terrible and I didn\u2019t even read it. (My sister in law made me go with her and I agreed because I wanted her to like me. Every family has one, mine is my SIL.) But you should be familiar with Anne Rice, True Blood, Underworld, etc. Those kinds of vampires. The super sexy ones, not Nosferatu or some derpy guy from Transylvania who sounds like The Count on Sesame Street. (also, if you like vampires, you need to see the independent film: What We Do In The Shadows, it\u2019s a little known gem from 2014.)\n\n\\- Is over 21. Nothing against teenagers, but I don\u2019t want to go to federal prison because you lied about your age.\n\n\\-Writes in 3rd person. Multiple paragraphs.\n\n\\- Is capable of writing in a novel-esque sort of way. What I mean by that is: what you are writing should flow, should have some details, because you are part of a team telling this story. Yeah, this advertisement is for Vampires, but there is so much more than just Vampires in this world. Let me bring you up to speed.\n\nIt\u2019s modern day New Orleans. Vampires have \u201ccome out of the coffin.\u201d There are Witches, kind of like the ones you might have seen on AHS: Coven, but they\u2019re still in the broom closet, but they\u2019re there and yep, Stevie Nicks is one of \u2018em. But they like to keep to themselves.\n\nVoodoo, well it\u2019s always been a touristy moneymaker, you can decide if it\u2019s real or not in your opinion, that\u2019s fine. But somewhere here behind the tourist trappings and the retail, there\u2019s an OG Voodoo queen. There are Werewolves, but in keeping with typical lore, they don\u2019t like Vampires.\n\nThe religious zealots are flipping out. Y\u2019all think Trump Supporters are bad? Wait until you meet the people from The Fellowship of the Sun - they are losing their minds. Vampires are real? Grab your silver crucifixes, because with their \u201cglamoring\u201d people, and the whole Vampire Rights Movement in the news, and the Japanese invention of synthetic blood allowing Vampires, creatures of the dark, to walk amongst us? Church ladies are clutching their pearls.\n\nYou can decide what kind of Vampire you write. Just because this takes place in New Orleans, it does not mean I am looking for something straight out of a Sookie Stackhouse day dream. I want some of your style. Tell me about him. What\u2019s your vision? (Because I \\*might\\* need you to be the center of a love triangle.) But I need you to be possible of plotting and planning and having a direction you want to go in. I don\u2019t require character sheets, I think anything that you feel I should know about your character should be revealed to me through your writing.\n\nSo message me, tell me your idea or what you think you could add to this universe.",

The Duke, a greedy man who, in the interest of gaining additional power, wanted his family to have ties with the witch hunters, decided to force you to become a recruit in the academy.\n\nNow this involuntary career path would already be bad enough if it wasn't for the fact that there is a big secret you kept from your father.

The binding happened recently and right after it happened you were send to the witch hunter academy.\n\n- The demons name is Farangar.\n\n- You don't know how to get rid of the demon and the books that might contain the answer are back in the castle of your father.\n\n- You and your character must be 18+\n\n- Platform is Kik or discord\n\n- There is no requirement in skill or length.

            "selftext": "When I say traditional I mean I'd like this roleplay to be at least somewhat inspired by an existing mahuo shoujo series to give us some basic groundwork for a plot. I am very comfortable with creating original worlds and characters but when it comes to capturing the thematics of a magical girl story, I would be a lot happier roleplaying with a writer who knows what they want from this whether it be the flashy magic duels, the colorful transformations, melodrama and fluff, or romance.  \n\n\nThe following series act are my biggest inspirations when it comes to this sort of roleplaying:   \nSailor Moon  \nCardcaptor Sakura  \nPreCure (Any of the series)  \nUrusei Yatsura  \nCutey Honey  \nMadoka Magica  \nWith some less traditional ones being shows like:  \nPanty and Stocking   \nLittle Witch Academia   \nKill La Kill   \nand others.  \n\n\nNow if you aren't familiar with any of these series it's not a problem but I will definitely be taking some concepts from at least a couple of these and I'd love to know if you're a fan of any. I am also willing to follow along with any of your own inspirations, if it's magic or superpower related, I can clash with it! Depending on how this part of our plotting goes, the RP can be as canon or OC-focused as it needs to be.  \n\n\nI'd like to keep this ad brief for now and see what kind of RP wants you guys might have on here but please DM me so we can discuss all the possibilities!

Living in our one bedroom apartment I\u2019m not the best part of the neighborhood but it was all two broke college students could afford anything besides the cup noodles and Netflix. You were fed up and didn\u2019t want us to struggle so you went off to the military hoping you\u2019ll earn some extra cash with hopes of returning and giving me the \u201cthe perfect life\u201d.\n\nThe first year, we\u2019d send endless letters and talked almost every night. The second year we talked but it slowed down the letters got distant and the phone calls were either once every two weeks or once a month. Year three was the toughest the letters and phone calls stopped completely.\n\nNow you\u2019re back in town you\u2019re ready to pick up where we left off but a lot of things have changed since we last talked, since we last seen each other.. Am I going to be open arms? Will I have moved on? Endless possibilities \n\nSo this will be about a couple who\u2019ve been together since their senior year in high school\nand together through most of their college years. He wants to give her the perfect life, wants her to see that she deserves more. She didn\u2019t feel that way she loved their life before he left and she wasn\u2019t so sure she liked the new one he was trying to put her in.\n\nThis will be very heavy on emotion and drama so if you\u2019re interested please have a character bio ready! I know this post is kinda patchy and missing a few this but just made this up on the spot would really love to elaborate more with someone and see where this goes.",

I can do modern or medieval, but no sci-fi, no end of the world, no futuristic, no dragons and mermaids and ogres. I like romance, lots of drama, maybe some action? or maybe adventure? Depends on the roleplay! I am open to playing all kinds of characters! (But no FxF) I can play male, female, gay, straight... You name it. There is going to be some stuff I won't do, but just ask and I'll let you know!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't currently have any ideas to post on here because I don't want people to think that it's all I'll do! I like roleplaying a lot of different things and I'd love to hear your ideas, or perhaps we could just come up with something together, the old fashioned way!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI like to write as much as I can, but it doesn't always have to be something ten posts long. Haha. That being said, I'm not going to roleplay with someone who only gives me about three lines or text for a response. I very often hit the 2000 character limit on Discord, so keep that in mind if you're looking for a reference on how much I write. I can cross the 2000 character limits, once, twice, even three times for a response depending on what I have to go off of. Yes, I understand that sometimes the characters are just talking so the responses won't be as long, but I would expect them to pick up length as we moved on to other scenes instead of staying at dialogue length.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNO TEXT TALK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHope to talk to you soon!

            "selftext": " \n\n\"To have blossom on a day like this...\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"The gods write a sick comedy boy...\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey had been breaking for hours. Petals against the empty azure. Dancing low and high. Doomed spirits. Each and every one would come crashing down to dirt and mud. To end. To rot. The cloudless sky carried the two voices far. Across red seas and once-animated forms. Across faded memories. Across what the monks and scholars would call 'Tranquillity'. 'Harmony'. 'Peace'. And of course, death.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"...You think we'll find any?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Any what..? Oh! Perhaps... There ought to be one or two...\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTheir steps were just as audible as the words, albeit aslo subtle. Ghostly. A mockingly creeping danger. The death by a thousand cuts. Only the na\u00efve would call such a thing mere suffering. It was nightmare. They did their best to avoid the bodies. The still. Even with total focus such a thing would have been difficult; it had been a big battle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cR-really? But some might have already got away, right?\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cHmm\u2026 Unlikely. It takes time for a demon to get back on its feet. Especially out away from normal-folk.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t we just burn it anyway? The whole field? That would wake them up! It beats just checking the corpses like this and taking them back\u2026\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cIdiot! And have your life taken instead? Fire cant kill 'em anyway. Besides, this way we get first pick of off the bodies.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cBut the stench alone is- Wait!\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe was right, the stench of the thing was nigh unbearable. But one could argue cooking flesh was little better than sitting flesh, at least for the first few days. The other speaker also recited truths. Dying so recently would mean muscles still had to weave themselves back together. Nerves had to be stitched slowly. He was correct about fire too. It was one of the worst ways to die, if the smoke didn\u2019t take mercy upon you, but even in charred dust, one\u2019s life went on. They were visible now, having shuffled their bored forms into the corner of the eye. One was tall, the other shorter, and junior too by perhaps a decade. The simple garb of peasant infantry. One walked with a spear, using the pole as a staff-walking stick. The other, the young, clutched the hilt of his sword tightly, knuckles white, eyes wide.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFear drowned the little man.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cThat one there. It moved didn\u2019t it? I-its eyes! J-just now. A-and look at the colour! It isn\u2019t pale at al-\u201c\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cQuiet! A-are you sure?\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cOf course im sure!\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe older passed the spear to his companion, eyes locking with mine. He too, shivering. \u201cGods your'e right.. S-So\u2026 we kill it\u2026 again\u2026 and take it back to the capital\u2026\u201d He swallowed low, shaky hands wavering in the spring breeze. Blossom stroked the tip of his nose and was promptly smacked away instinctively as if it were a fly or mosquito. \u201cWe\u2019re rich men! The bounty\u2026 My family wont have to work again!\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe approached.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother death. How many now?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut this fate\u2026 this future.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTorment without end.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would scream if I could move my mouth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe young man turned to mist, something thin hitting him fast through the side of the head. In one ear, out the other, the skull shattering like glass. It caused the body to flip before landing, the force of the projectile scattering the ruined thing like petals in the wind. The older turned before being caught in the side, rending him as a woodsman fells a tree, splinters of bone erupting from the immediately fatal wound. He collapsed like playing cards. His legs one way, the torso the other. Half Split.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA third voice. Out of view.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cYou too?\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe sound of a blood cleaned off a blade.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cImmortal?\u201d\n\n\\---\n\nI am looking for a partner to roleplay with on discord for a (low?) fantasy rp about a character who can not permanently die. Instead, they return from death, their body slowly regenerating. I would ask you to write in past tense for the stark majority of your writing, only including present tense sparingly. I would prefer you to write in third person, but ive had some awesome roleplays with first person writers and wouldnt mind trying out your style!\n\nPlease understand, the above text is not necessarily what your character is thinking. The 'Third Voice' Is also not necessarily your character. Its just a bit of writing to give you an idea of the atmosphere im aiming for and explain the concept.\n\nMy initial idea for a setting was one more similar to feudal japan than conventional medieval fantasy (Hence the blossom), but after thought, this idea could really work in any old fantasy setting, even historical fantasy. I still think a Japanese 'samurai' like atmosphere would be the best, but Ill happily discuss other ideas with you, even if you dont want to actually roleplay but just world build. Your character could also be from any background. This could be the first time they are killed and they discover their immortality, or the 1000th, having become totally disillusioned with life. The cost of the power to return from death is that a random mortal somewhere near by dies instead, their life being taken in exchange for yours. I've had a few people in the past suggest a norse theme for this RP. While I think this is a fantastic idea, I also want for a 'civilisation' feel (Big cities and castles) for alot of the setting. Perhaps your character is from this norse like culture however? We can certainly set a portion of the story there.\n\nI take a GM style of roleplaying, taking control of setting and most characters, providing a story which ultimately your character stars in. This allows you to experience the plot, meet new characters and learn about them as your own character does. It means I can continually surprise you with twists and offer fun clues and foreshadowing to ongoing mysteries. I will never speak for your character or describe their action. All that is on you. Its your character. I understand that this style is not for everyone, as there are some who enjoy plotting stories out beforehand, so no hard feelings if you aren\u2019t so keen.\n\nRomance is by no means a necessity for this role play, but it is always quite fun. I always think its best to wait and see what happens organically regardless.\n\nI normally write 200-500 a response, one or two responses a day. I don\u2019t expect a partner to match me out of obligation, but I would like at least over 100 words. A lot can be said about even the smallest of actions or sentences.\n\nIf you have any questions, please ask in the comments below so others might read them. I'd really appreciate if you included a short writing sample in your message, as well as some information about yourself and the timezone you live in.\n\nI hope to hear from you soon.",

Mostly SFW and in 3rd person. \n\nFirst idea: Its the mid 1930s and Hollywood glamour is all the rage. I play an actress and you work on the movie lot(you can pick anything, camera man, work in the costume department, writer etc). My character has done a lot to get to where she is including sleeping with others for roles. We meet on set and slowly start falling for one another. \n\nSecond idea: You're a detective who's currently investigating the homicide of an old oil tycoon. Naturally his young beautiful wife(my character) who happens to be the sole benefactor of his wealth is the main suspect. \n\nThird idea: You're a gambler who's been caught cheating in casino. You manage to talk your way into not only  getting away with all your fingers but also a job from the casino owner and form an uneasy partnership with him. He introduces you to his new wife (my character), we happen to be ex-lovers.\n\nOthers ideas are welcomed and encouraged. Pm me",

            "selftext": "Hello there! I'll keep this post real short because the concept of it isn't necessarily that complicated.   \n\n\nThe story is about a male or female character (whatever your preference) that has returned from a war and is.. Different. Your character has been in a relationship with this person (dating or married) ever since they were deployed and has been waiting for their return for almost three years now. Their mission was classified, so they weren't able to communicate everything with you. Their acts during their deployment has even gotten them the Navy Cross medal, which is right below the medal of honor.  \n\n\nYour character should be happy that they've returned, right? So why does something feel off about them? Perhaps war really does change people in unforeseeable ways.  \n\n\nThat's the gist of it! Now to discuss my rules/other notes:\n\n* 18+ in age please! This story can and will have dark themes.\n* This is semi-realistic, meaning that not everything will make sense. There will be some supernatural themes (no, not like spooky ghosts or werewolves). My character will have some sort of unnatural ability.\n* Literate.\n* I'm looking for you to play a female character. I can play male or female but I would appreciate it if you're playing a female character!\n* Able to respond 2-3 times a day or more. I get for some people that it's a lot, so if you ever end up getting really busy or what have you just let me know! I'll understand and be patient. \n* Friendly OOC chat is highly encouraged!\n* I'm looking for partners that put effort into their roleplaying. A paragraph or two minimum, even more is better. No one liners.\n\nOkay, that's all I can think of for now! If you're interested, please DM me and we'll iron things out from there! Thanks for reading :)",

            "selftext": "##New Rule on Group Posts: You may make one group post every **14 days** and a group may advertise no more often than once every **14 days**.\n\nThis applies to **any and all** group posts. If you're looking for RP with more than one other person, that's a group post. If you post that you're looking for 1x1 and open to making a group, that's a group post. It doesn't matter if you're only recruiting for 5 people or have a group that needs 1 more, it's still a group post and subject to all the usual group post rules and time limits. \n\nGroup posts also include group interest checks and/or searching for staff vs members. There is no \"loophole\" that will let you post for any group more than once in a 14 day period - this means if you're making a group \"interest check\" post then you may not make another post related to *any* group until 14 days have elapsed from the first post. This includes \"updates\" like looking for staff, looking for members, etc. You may edit your original post, but may not make a new one until a full 14 days have passed from the first post. \n\nFurthermore, other accounts may not post for the same group within that 14 day period, nor may you make alt accounts to advertise multiple different groups. \n\nOnce you have made a group post you may make 1x1 RP searching posts as long as at least 24 hours have elapsed from your last post on /r/roleplay. The inverse situation also applies: if you make a 1x1 post then you must wait 24 hours to make a group post unless you changed that 1x1 post into a group, in which case you must then wait 14 days to advertise the same content. All 1x1 posts must be *completely unrelated* to any groups you have posted for or they will be removed.\n\n---\n\n**Consequences of rule violations on group timer limits**\n\nMaking 2 group posts on the same account before 14 days have elapsed will result in the newer post being removed and a warning. If you violate this rule again your account and group will be banned for 3 months. \n\nDeleting and reposting on the same account before 14 days have elapsed will result in both your account and your group being banned for 3 months.\n\nIf multiple accounts post for the same group before 14 days have passed from the first post then all accounts and the group will be banned for 3 months. This increases to 6 months if it was deleted on one account and reposted with another before 14 days have passed. \n\nIf a group attempts to circumvent the temp bans with other accounts they will be reported for ban evasion to the admins as this is in violation of the reddit TOS, and all accounts affiliated with the group will be permanently banned, as will the group. \n\nIf a previously banned group or account returns when their temp ban has expired and breaks any rule again they and the group will be permanently banned. \n\n---\n\n**All the other subreddit and reddit rules still pertain.** This means no hub, collection, and/or partner-finding servers or forums or links to sub-sections of such hubs/forums. No linking to NSFW/ERP groups or x-posting your group on NSFW subs. No underage NSFW. No MMO/gaming servers (i.e. minecraft, byond, xbox, etc.). No personal contact information may be posted (discord links are not considered personal information, but individual discord handles are). And remember, as always the *comments of other posts* are not additional advertising space for your group. \n\n**We will no longer allow D&amp;D or other TTRPG systems to post here looking for players.** /r/LFG is specifically for this content. **This includes West Marches style servers especially.**",

Planets are colonized, space travel is the norm, etc. I can see it being an adventure/thriller, but it would also go off in a pretty dark direction. I want to explore themes like body horror, transhumanism, and so on. There would also be a romance angle. I've never done a sci-fi RP before, so hopefully someone with more experience could help me with the worldbuilding. Just to clarify, I'm female but am playing a male role. I'm seeking either a female partner or a guy who can write female characters well, either is fine with me. My preferred chat platform is discord.

You can be any race of life form you desire. Choose a class and join me on an adventure to retake the kingdom. The artifacts left by the otherworldly humans still lurk. I have plans for this RP although it may sound clich\u00e9. Start a chat or PM me if you are interested. It will be all over discord and after 1 week we will start. No limits on how many can join.",

It was hard, but your talent helped you stand out as a beacon of hope to those around you. Now, a year after the final killing game that endangered the members of the Future Foundation, a search has begun for the \u201cNext Generation\u201d of students to lead the world into hope and out of despair for the final time. But it couldn\u2019t be that easy, could it ?*\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nHello, and welcome to Hopes Held High; A new Danganronpa RP hosted on Discord ! For those that have never played it, Danganronpa is a game in which high school students are trapped inside a confined area and given the task of murdering another student in order to escape. The games are based on a system of chapters that are split into different parts. Each chapter begins with an additional motive given to the students to create another reason for escape. The students are then given time to interact with each other and develop relationships with each other over the course of a few days. After this time, the students discover a victim and begin an investigation into the culprit. Once the investigation has been held, a class trial takes place where students give alibis and point blame until the murderer, or \"blackened\", has been revealed and voted for. The blackened then faces an execution, and the game continues. Our RP will follow the events of and spoil the games up to and past the anime, Danganronpa 3, so be warned that spoilers will come up !\n\nFor our killing game, these chapters will be drawn out in order to actually allow interaction between players. This RP is a killing game, so characters will be in a setting similar to that of the Danganronpa games. That being said, the rating of things will be kept similar to the games as well: There will be no inappropriate RP or excessive gore allowed. A full list of rules can be found on our server, but you can be assured that all roleplay must be consensual between all parties and we take measures to ensure that. We hope you\u2019ll check us out !\n\nOur server link is available [ [here](https://discord.gg/af5tFXb) ] for more information !",

            "selftext": "Okay, so hopefully I haven't totally messed up that title, and if I have, then whoops, my bad.\n\nSo hi!\n\nI'm Dave. I'm a 30y/o roleplaying veteran, and I've been rping since I was 15 or so- first on Neopets, and then on various internet forums and internet mediums. Maybe you knew me, even. Maybe not.\n\nI've been away from this sort of thing for a while, but now I'm back, and looking to maybe give this whole thing a go again! I usually write in first person past tense (I looked at her, she looked at me, etc) but I can give third person a go if you're staunchly anti-first-person.\n\nI consider myself 'literate', and can write several paragraphs per post or reply or whatever. Though length does vary, I prefer to keep things at 3-5 per pop, so events can keep moving swiftly, and we don't get bogged down in unnecessary filler details that do nothing whatsoever to drive the plot along. Sometimes I might write a shorter amount, depending on energy levels or whatever, but I'm usually pretty consistent.\n\nI'm willing to give most genres a go, but I prefer slice of life stuff, modern day fantasy, medieval fantasy, Victorian fantasy, science fiction (see a pattern here?), pretty much any kind of fantasy. Low or high doesn't matter, but I prefer things to be in some way not the norm at all, even if it might seem normal for the characters.\n\nSpeaking of, I prefer to play my own gender, but I can play female if it's necessary to the plot; if I do play female, I'd prefer us both to be playing that. I don't do mxm at all. I prefer to focus on two characters, bringing in others when needed, but I'm open to other alternative ideas too.\n\nI prefer the slow-burn romantic kinds of plots, with lots of character development, gratuitous adorableness, and lashings of angst and emotional turmoil. I'm not a huge fan of gore for gore's sake, but if it makes sense in context, I'm all for it.\n\nI have a few ideas floating round, and some more in my head that haven't yet been written anywhere. At the moment, I've got a few everyday ideas, a couple or three involving people with superpowers, a couple of Fantasy things, and some miscellaneous stuff, too.\n\nI'm around most of the time, and can reply pretty regularly, and will often match whatever I'm given in terms of quality, length, etc.\n\nI prefer to use Discord or something similar, but if you're only able - or willing- to use Reddit PMs or emails, then I can work with that too. Please don't send me messages on Reddit chat- I don't use it, and I will totally miss your messages.\n\nI look forward to hearing from whomsoever this might interest!",

I won't follow exactly what I'm writing but the same red line is there!\n\nThis is meant for either a male or female with my female character. plot below, if interested please contact me!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\* \\\\/Plot\\\\/ \\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was late in the evening, y/c has done their nightly routine and just entered bed for a good night rest.

            "selftext": "Hello, hello! Here I am, with just another partner search after I've been busy for some time. The last few weeks I found myself interested in Harry Potter again, reading the books once again for like the.. seventh time? \n\nBut before I get to the pairing, I'd like to point out a few rules:\n\n* No one liners. It's probably the worst thing ever. try to write more, at least a decent paragraph. (I won't chop your head off if you throw in a bit less once)\n* Be patient. I have a life, I have a job, I'd like to have some time for myself as well every now and then. \n* No god-modding. Please, don't come to me with an OC more powerful than Dumbledore and Voldemort combined. Just.. don't.\n* I won't forbid it, but I will stay a bit critical when it comes to \"Harry's twin sister\" or something like that\n* I am open to double. Would be cool if you are as well.\n\nSo, now to the more interesting part. Sadly, I have to admit that I have made a lot of bad experiences with OC x OC RPs, so I'm rather hesitant about them. Anyway, you can offer me a good idea and I'll think about it.\n\nI much prefer canon x OC and canon x canon! \n\nFor the canon ships, I'd really like to explore some Luna and Neville. They are so soft and rather unproblematic. But for everyone who likes drama, I'd be in for Draco and Hermione, and maybe Harry and Draco. I would also be interested in trying George and Angelina, after the war, where he surely has a pretty deep depression because of Fred. But I'm still open to the more casual ships like Ron and Hermione, Ginny and Harry and any suggestions.\n\nAnd I love Wolfstar as well! Remus and Sirius are such an interesting couple.\n\nNow to the canon and oc. I won't list here who of the male and female characters I can play. Rather those I can't. So, I can't play Snape, Bellatrix, Voldemort (Tom Riddle is a different story) or Lucius for you.\n\nI got a high number of OCs, fitting for any type. But to get to more specific ideas, I had one in mind where both OCs are siblings and are complete opposites, even up to reaching the point where one follows their love interest to the dark side and one has a love interest from the good side. \n\nBut I'm open to anything , really.\n\nI can play over kik, discord and Reddit itself.",

This may be specific, but I'm really yearning for a good bit of romance with some possible hurt/comfort and darker aspects, plus an apt amount of drama. \n\nThe world would be best described as Tolkien-esque, or your average D&amp;D setting. Elves and dwarves, magic and monsters, so on and so forth. I'm sort of pulling this out of my butt as I type, so nothing is set in stone yet, and we'd iron out the details together. \n\nAs for a little bit about myself...\nMy name is Saph, and I'm 20! I'm from Canada, in which I reside in the pacific standard time zone, and spend a lot of time working. But, that being said, I am able to reply throughout the day, and get home in the afternoon. I have 6 or so years of experience with roleplaying, and fancy myself a proficient writer. I'm usually able to spout out 3-6 paragraphs, though I enjoy shorter replies, too. I write in the 3rd person. Whether you use third or first (or whatever else) doesn't matter to me. \n\nI'd like to maintain a friendly rapport with whomever I end up with, but I have had issues with people getting downright creepy in the past. So please, let's be friends, but keep it cute and not creepy :)\n\nThanks for you time!",

            "selftext": "So... I'm really tired of the ghosting, lack of communication etc and I'm currently strictly looking for the type of roleplayers that enjoy writing one plot after another with a couple of people rather than switching rp partners every 72 hours ;p If that's not your cup of tea, then please don't read any further or reach out because we're not going to be a good match.\n\nNow that that's out of the way... My name is Liam, I'm 21 years old and I'm currently enjoying my summer holiday (though I'll be active as well when college starts again of course!). I love writing and I'm currently writing a book, though next to that I really enjoy roleplaying. I write M/M and M/F romances next to the genres slice of life, drama and angst. (I won't reply to people asking me to write different genres.)\n\nHere's what I'm looking for writing-wise:\n\n\\- I like writing actively. Now I know not everyone has the time to shoot a couple replies a day, some days I can't either, but I do expect at least 1 reply every 2 days. If you get busy, just let me know and it won't be a dealbreaker as long as it doesn't happen over and over again.\n\n\\- Real-life face claims only.\n\n\\- At least up to 10 sentences per reply. The longer the better.\n\n\\- 3rd person. No text talk. Proper English.\n\n\\- You must be 18+ in real life.\n\n\\- My characters don't top in m/m ships. This doesn't mean that they can't take control, but they do prefer to take it... You know what I mean. I'm looking for manly, confident characters. Feminine, extremely shy, you name it doesn't interest me to roleplay as or with.\n\n**- If you're someone who can't be honest when they don't like someone and would rather ghost than talk about it, don't add me. I, myself, will tell you when I don't like an idea or something that's going. I expect my writing partners to do the same as well. This way, we can find a solution rather than either of us feeling like we've wasted our time on each other.**\n\n\\- It's a plus if you enjoy talking outside of the roleplay as well as constantly coming up with ideas and shipping our characters : )\n\nIf you're interested in writing, please shoot me an introduction here. If I think we're a good match I'll either add you on discord if you've added yours or shoot you my own : )\n\nHappy writing! : D",

Over the years I\u2019ve had the pleasure of writing with a plethora of people, in just about every genre imaginable. I\u2019ve cultivated friendships with these individuals outside of writing that\u2019s led to some of the best RP\u2019s that have spanned years. So, when I look for a partner, I\u2019m looking for someone who wants something long-term, enjoys world building, character development, and story development through the RP itself. Hopefully you share those same values.\n\nI\u2019m primarily a novella style poster (Three paragraphs or more), but I also take into account what\u2019s going on in the story, as well as my partner\u2019s style. Quantity is certainly not everything. I do my best to make sure spelling, punctuation, and grammar are absolutely basic (What good is RP if you can\u2019t understand what I\u2019m typing?), so you should as well. I admit though, I have a love/hate relationship with commas. Also, I love email. I usually transpose the RP while it\u2019s happening to Google Docs, where writing can also happen. I\u2019m open to Discord, but it\u2019s not really work friendly for me. We can talk about this.\n\nAs the title suggests, I\u2019m looking for RP set in the world of Trinity, Fallout, or WoD. We would have original characters and use base information that\u2019s readily available. From there we can begin plotting. World building, characters, character histories, background, and storytelling. The works. I want to share the story, not run it. You shouldn\u2019t want to do so either. The flow should be automatic and the equilibrium between push/pull of events by writers should be balanced. I\u2019m an adult (Please be one as well), so please expect mature themes. At request, I can offer some post examples as well as info on the asked for genres.\n\nAeon Trinity \u2013 Cyberpunk to the fullest. Science Fiction with a taste of realism.\n\nFallout \u2013 It\u2019s Fallout, not much more needs to be said.\n\nWoD \u2013 Vampires, wolves, demons, witches, etc. Modern Supernatural Horror. It never gets old.\n\nShoot me a line if this appeals to you!",

            "selftext": "Hey all! Looking to run a new campaign set in one of two original settings.\n\nOne offers a more political bent to proceedings, a late-medieval level of technology, and optional potential for threading into the misadventures of other leaders of men written by actual players in separate campaigns. Taking the role of a political leader suits this setting best: be it delving into the various intrigues of a republic, taking heed of your parliament, or meaning to rule with absolute power as an archetypal Warrior-King\n\nThe other setting is more apparently suited to the adventure of an individual. Likely the sort not particularly looking to shape any given nation beyond where their travels might take them. Not dissimilar tech level for the vast majority of the populace, but this is a world still recovering from tremendous loss after innumerous generations; with irreproducible marvels dotting the land and extraordinary individuals still roaming it.\n\nI mean to aim for something resembling Realism, though the latter delves into something more like pseudo-realism, albeit entirely consistent within the world itself. In both cases there'd be no dice-rolls, character sheets or the like.\n\nIf either of these settings at all interest you, feel free to PM me. I'd terribly appreciate some manner of writing sample. A love for the English language, history, and literacy goes a long way!\n\nCheers!",

Including, but not limited to:\n\n* Who I'm playing as (preference for a male character- big preference for m!Byleth or Ashe! But can be persuaded with the right ship!)\n* Who you're playing as (the ones listed are just a preference that I'm most into! But I am interested in, and open to other characters too!)\n* What we're playing (I'm totally interested in something mixing together things such as fluff, shippy, drama, smut- etc!)\n* And more, I am flexible!\n\nThat being said! What I'm primarily interested in is as you can likely guess; playing as m!Byleth for any of the lovely characters listed!!! Ideally; I'd love to do a long-term thread that's a mixture of fluff, smut, drama, action and such! We can do post-game, during the game, or even something following through the entire game itself!\n\nBasically- this is a master post! I'm keen and open to anything, from smutty scenes during the Academy days to hurt/comfort during the War! (Disclaimer: All characters will be portrayed as 18+, no exception.)\nI'd list some of my top ships, but I'm open to anything! I'd love anything with Byleth as I said- and Ashe x Ingrid is definitely something I'd love to play!\n\nIn addition, I am also open to doubling, if that's your cup of tea! So please don't be afraid to come at me with many pairings! I'll be happy to play almost anyone for you, as long as you play someone for me!\n\nWithout further ado, please enjoy the list of characters! And again- please feel free to come at me with all kinds of suggestions!\n| Bernadetta von Varley | Dorothea Arnault | Edelgard von Hresvelg | Flayn | Ingrid Brandl Galatea | Linhardt von Hevring | Petra Macneary | And others! |\n\nI hope to have caught the interest of some of y'all~! I'm super looking forward to writing together and making some great threads! Please come by my PMs with questions or anything like that- and we'll hopefully get cracking!",

I'm looking for a role playing partner (preferably on Discord but other options can, of course, always be discussed) for a story for which I have a basic premise and which we can customize beyond that.\n\nThe premise is this: the story is set in Latin America somewhere in the 20th Century (my mind went out to the second half, but it's not requirement), perhaps an island in the Caribbean, perhaps a fictional Central American Republic, you name it. Our characters play some relatively low-ranking government officials/military officers and become witness to a military coup by the army against the ineffectual and corrupt civilian government. Shooting breaks out in the halls of the presidential palace and after the chaos falls down, we find out that in the crossfire virtually everyone on both sides died, leaving us to be the highest ranking people around. Aka, suddenly leadership of the nation has fallen in our laps by accident. (so in essence, think of the premise of Designated Survivor)\n\nFrom here on, we can go any direction we want. Perhaps try to rule fairly or even institute elections while trying to keep the army at bay. Or establish a regime that aims only to keep everyone in line since we obviously know what's best for everyone. And, again, everything is possible and we won't be stuck in endless political squabble if you got that impression (unless that's what you want). If you like political intrigue we can do that. If you instead want military action and shooting that's fine too. Maybe even your character will end up plotting to dethrone mine or vice versa. Or perhaps a bit of all of that.\n\nFeel free to message me with any offers, ideas or questions you have and we can go and play if you like. Some others details: I'm fine with any gender pairing, romance, amount of characters, you name it. Anything that makes for a good story is fine for me.",

Perhaps both applied to the same position in the student union. Perhaps a petty bit of upstaging escalated so now they continually try to mess with each other. Perhaps they used to be quite close, but fell out. Perhaps their hostile relationship is famous across the whole student community.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDue to a housing administration error or just plain bad luck, the two would find themselves as flatmates for the next year of their studies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs well as this, each would also be avid players of a popular MMO, but keep this a secret from their friends and most importantly, each other. I think it could be a very entertaining roleplay to tell the story of these characters, who are so opposed to each other in real life, but are very close friends in game without realising. There would be many supporting characters to interact with, both in game and in real life. There are alot of ways we could take this RP and iron out the details, so we'll have to discuss it for a little while before we start. That said, I do have a vague idea of the key themes I want to centre the RP around, that of anonymity, trust and identity. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I take a GM style of roleplaying, taking control of setting and most characters, providing a story which ultimately your character stars in. This allows you to experience the plot, meet new characters and learn about them as your own character does. It means I can continually surprise you with twists and offer fun clues as well as foreshadowing to ongoing mysteries. I will never speak for your character or describe their action. All that is on you. Its your character. I understand that this style is not for everyone, as there are some who enjoy plotting stories out beforehand, so no hard feelings if you aren\u2019t so keen. I would also ask that you write in past tense. I don't really have a preference on first person or third person, but we'll talk briefly about what you choose regardless. I will always write in third person. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt should go without saying that this RP requires you to have an understanding of at least the basics of MMO games. Knowing about things like Raids, Guilds and Auction Houses. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI normally write 150-500 words a response, and while I dont expect my partner to match me exactly, I would like each reply to be at least over 100 words. I roleplay exclusively on discord.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDont hesitate to ask any questions in the comments below so others might read them. If you arent so keen on this idea for a RP dont be afraid to tell me why. Please send a writing sample if you wish to contact me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks, I look forward to hearing from you.",

Although, for 18+ content you will need to also be 18+.\n\nSo the general idea is that we are in a high Fantasy world, and we wind up ( as rookie adventurers ) in a small town where we notice some bounty posters advertising the extermination of a gnoll.  This can be a single shot, or we can keep it rolling. \n\nWe can make this as detailed or as simple as you're comfortable with. \n\nBelow is a simple starter which should also give you an example of my writing style.\n\nFeel free to respond with your own ideas or even just jump right in.\n\n_____________\nThe hard thud of footsteps can be hear across the mostly empty rooms wooden floor. The soft clang of metal rattles outward as the oak door shuts behind him.\n\n\"I'm here about the poster\" he stated.\n\n\u00a0His dirty fingers lightly held a sun darkened piece of parchment. On the front, which dangled in front of his face. Said \"WANTED: MONSTER HUNTER. \" Followed by the picture of a gnoll.\"Talk to Parker in the inn, 5 gold bounty.\"\n\n\"Says to talk to..\" he turned the page around and seemingly studied the words. \"Pah..paur....park---harr.\" \n\nThe Inkeep interrupted him, \"Parker, that's me. Have a seat in the chair over there.\" He said pointing at a long\u00a0 well worn wooden table with several dark stains and three stump chairs around it.\n\nA loaf of butter bread sat on the table, and the smell matched it's name.\n\nThe Inkeep noticed the man stare at the bread and said, \"Help yourself, would you like a cold ale to wash it down?\" Excitedly the man nodded yes. \" What's your name stranger?\" With a mouth full of bread his voice muffled out, \"Solan, thanks!\" The barkeep set down the ale in front of the Dark haired man.\n\nDeep scars lined his left cheek and his face was dirty and covered with stubble. Although non-traditionally handsome he did have striking blue eyes. The color of ocean water.\n\nOn his back he carried a ratty wooden shield and an unremarkable iron sword. They had both seen plenty of use and the innkeep unpon noticing their wear had a good feeling about sending this man on the job.\n\nThe innkeep walked back to the long wooden bar lined with casks of wine and ale, grabbed his rag and started to wipe the top of the counter.\n\nAs the fire crackled Solan worked on finishing the loaf of butter bread and the loud creak of the metal door handle broke the silence as the door opened.

That means I am very busy: there will be days when my brain will be fried and served with pickles.\n\nIf you add my frequent pauses and bouts of grief to the above, you will see why I'm looking for those who understand that I am not able to deliver novella type posts. For me, a writer can describe feelings and actions in a few words, and this is what I seek right now. Meaningful but laid back realism, having fun, being able to relax. Also looking for a lot of OOC discussion about the story itself.\n\nPlease be at least over 18, because mature themes will surely arise: not as a form of compulsion, but as an organic part of the story.\n\nAdult women are what I am looking to play at the moment, in MxF relationships. Romance and Drama are vital for me, as moving, evolving character studies of some sort. I am not interested in Anime or Furry, sorry about that.\n\nFANDOMS\n\nThe Godfather\n\nMarvel Cinematic Universe\n\nThe Lord of the Rings\n\nThe Haunting of Hill House\n\nKingdom\n\nThe Crown\n\nThe Phantom of the Opera\n\nEasy\n\nIvanhoe\n\nORIGINAL THEMES AND GENRES\n\nModern\n\nDrama\n\nRomance\n\nRealism\n\nMafia/Modern Crime\n\nHit me up with ideas, plots, cravings, pairings you might have in mind.

            "selftext": "Hi there! My name\u2019s Elowen, but you can call me Winnie. I\u2019m super excited to meet you soon. Thanks for checking out my post, I\u2019ve been craving some partners to write and make a fantastic story with.\n\nHere\u2019s just a few things to know:\n\u2014 I\u2019m a 18 year-old soon-to-be college student who works a part time job. I\u2019ll be quite busy after school starts, but I\u2019ll always do my best to reply ASAP with a well-written post. \n\u2014 I usually aim to post once or twice a day, I apologize if I don\u2019t. I do my best to respect my partner\u2019s life outside of the Internet and understand if it takes time for them to reply back\u2014 I hope you will do the same for me! A gentle reminder after a couple days is okay.\n\u2014 I usually RP on Discord, but I am open to other platforms, such as Kik, Reddit. Just ask!\n\u2014 I try to respond with at least a paragraph, I can write up to 4-5 paragraphs for a reply. Let me know what your preferred literate level is!\n\u2014 If you want to RP NSFW subjects with me, you must be over 18. Otherwise, I ask that my partners be 16 years old and over.\n\u2014 I can RP all sorts of characters, ranging in all sorts of different ages, genders, sexualities, and personalities. I am fine with mxm, fxf, and mxf\u2014 I\u2019m a sucker for fxf, though.\n\nHere are some fandoms that I\u2019d be interested into RPing. I mostly aim for my partner and I to play as OCs, but I can RP as canon characters as well! I\u2019m open to AU\u2019s and canon ships. Feel free to ask!\n\u2014 Overwatch\n\u2014 JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure\u2014 \ud83d\udc95\u2755\n\u2014 The Last of Us\n\u2014 Detroit: Become Human\n\u2014 Stranger Things\u2014 \ud83d\udc95\u2755\n\u2014 My Hero Academia\n\u2014 John Wick\u2014 \ud83d\udc95\u2755\nThere\u2019s definitely more that I can\u2019t think of, but you can always ask. If I remember some, I\u2019ll add them to the list.\n\nThese are some ideas off of the top of my brain. I am totally down to listen to your ideas, suggestions, etc. None of these are set in place, some of these are just genres/topics. \n\u2014 Horror/Psychological Horror\n\u2014 Mature and dark-themed\n\u2014 Parallel world/universe\n\u2014 Action/Thriller\n\u2014 Mafia/gangs/modern crime\n\u2014 Prison romance\n\u2014 Slice of Life\n\u2014 Apocalypse\nOnce again, I\u2019m probably forgetting some ideas and topics that intrigue. I am open to suggestions- we\u2019re partners, neither of us should dictate over each other.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested, just shoot me a DM! I\u2019m looking forward to hearing from you.",

            "selftext": "*Mystery, deep secrets, Southern values, witchcraft, religion, ghosts, and selling your soul to the devil...* \n\nThe aesthetic of Southern Gothic is one of my favorites, and recently I've been wanting to write out a story with someone that explores these elements. For context, I'm an 18-year-old trans guy who lives in the South and has recently been very intrigued by Southern Gothic stories and aesthetics.\n\n**Basic Storyline:**\n\nSet in the American South, this genre tends to deal with the supernatural, the dark, and the macabre, so as you may imagine, I'd like an 18+ partner that is comfortable with exploring mature themes, including violence, sex, unhealthy relationships, and death. I'm not really looking to do full fantasy, but there should definitely be elements of magic included, as well as a heavy aspect of religion\u2014I myself am not religious, though, so expect it to be painted in a somewhat negative light.\n\nThere's no specific plot I have in mind, only a vague idea\u2014a quiet Southern town, deeply religious, with many hidden secrets. I would love to build a world and a plot with my writing partner, and go off of that. \n\n**Characters:**\n\nGenerally, I would prefer to write queer characters and relationships. This isn't a must, but I'm less likely to accept a partner who wants to write exclusively heterosexual relationships. Whether it's M/M, F/F, or any mix of trans characters, I want to write diverse, queer characters, and explore what their lives might look like in this kind of setting. Diverse is meant in every sense of the word\u2014I don't want an all-white cast.\n\nI would probably like to focus on two or so \"main\" characters, but I also want to create a diverse cast of characters with my partner that feature heavily in the story. I'd like there to be a romance involved, as well. Writing sex scenes isn't required, but preferred. :) \n\nSo if you're interested, shoot me a message! I'd prefer to write either over Discord or Google Docs, with OOC chat in a Discord server rather over Reddit. I hope to hear from some people soon!\n\n[A playlist made by me for inspiration](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4WOJeLUuZdGXLO6wUrlRPj?si=kYUIVX7IRqG9x9s35xJ4Vg).",

Now before any of you click away as you don\u2019t know a thing about Bleach, please don\u2019t. This roleplay does not require any knowledge on the series as I will fill in your gaps of knowledge. Of course being a fan of the series is a big plus. \n\n(If you\u2019d like to read up on the series I\u2019ll leave a link to the wiki here: https://bleach.fandom.com/wiki/Bleach_Wiki) \n\nNow onto the meat of the prompt, in the roleplay we would playing in an alternative universe then the one of Bleach. This means that none of the characters exist or plot points have happened, allowing for much more creative freedom on our side. I imagine the roleplay would detail our characters\u2019 lives and adventures, these would be discussed in more detail after we have made our characters.\n\nNow then a little about me, I\u2019ve been roleplaying for 5 years now and enjoy to roleplay in 3rd person, past tense and I\u2019m more then capable of doing multiple paragraphs for a roleplay.\n\nNow what do I expect from you? Well not too much actually, all I ask is you be enthusiastic and for your post length, just give me something to work with, that\u2019s all. \n\nI hope to have tickled your fancy today, so please just send me a message, I\u2019m friendly and don\u2019t bite :)",

My name is Megan, new to Reddit, but certainly not new to roleplaying!\n\nI always have a couple of plot ideas laying around, but for the sake of keeping this message as short as I can, here's what kinds of things I would like to write about: mythology (Hades &amp; Persephone, for example), dark fairy-tale retellings, mystery/crime stories, supernatural hunters, historical plots, sci-fi stuff. I'm not afraid to get a little dark when it comes to plots and I love a good angsty story. I can also do Fandom RP's, but prefer creating OC's for them. I would really like a HP roleplay now that it's almost Fall again. Or something Star Wars related. (:\n\nI mostly write in 3rd person, but I would be happy to write in 1st if that's what you prefer! I also have more experience playing female characters, but if the muse is there I don't mind playing male characters and doubling up is always an option. My posts are usually 2-3 paragraphs in length, but I usually just match it with my partner's. Lastly, I have zero experience roleplaying on Discord and would prefer something like Google Docs (or something similar), Tumblr or even Reddit. But if someone's willing to show this noob how to use Discord, I'm also down for that.\n\nSome additional stuff:\n\n* Please be 18+, I'm 21 myself and I won't roleplay with minors.\n* I love getting to know my writing partner and just having talks outside of roleplaying.\n* I'm also a huge dork. I will probably make playlists for our characters and I can really get into a plot.\n\nAlright, just comment down below if you want to start this writing adventure or just jump straight into my PM.",

            "selftext": "Introduction\n\nHello everyone! I am a writer who goes by the name Beretta. I am twenty two years old and currently operate off the eastern coast of the United States. In terms of writing experience I would say it amounts up to about nine years worth of experience. My start in writing and story telling began on a website known as Gaia Online and continued on into adulthood through tabletop games and short stories. I'd like to believe that my skills have only improved since those humble beginnings but as with all things there is always more to learn.\n\nI'm currently employed and a student so my schedule can be chaotic. However my writing is the sole outlet for my creativity so I try to make as much time for it as I can. I aim for at least one lengthy post a day at the minimum and sometimes more on a really good day.\n\nI understand that may be a deal breaker for some but those are the struggles of adulthood.\n\nWriting Style and Preferences\n\nMy preferred writing style is third person past tense as it's what I personally feel comfortable with. My history as a former game master has left me with a habit of playing a main character and numerous side characters in an effort to make the story's setting feel alive. I don't require my partner to be able to play multiple characters as for some it can be a daunting task. \n\nIn terms of romantic pairings I do lean more towards hetero relationships between main characters. I prefer the romance to feel organic as opposed to railroaded. \n\nIn regards to romance in stories I prefer it to not be the focus of the story. I tend to make romances a slow burning underlying tension that grows over the course of the story. I personally find stories that start with the characters head over heels for each other tend to stall out quickly.\n\nIn regards to intimacy in stories I am comfortable with both smut and fade to black scenes. However I want to make it clear that I don't enjoy or plan to write pure smut. I won't argue the fact that it is an effective tool in an author's kit to show intimacy but it's not the only tool. A good romance story should explore all the forms of intimacy not just the physical ones.\n\nWhen it comes to the length of my posts they tend to be on the longer side depending on the situation. I am guilty of exceeding the two thousand character limit on certain platforms multiple times. My posts aren't always that long but I always try to leave my partner with enough to work with. I completely understand that some scenes and situations simply require less and that it boils down to quality over quantity.\n\nPartner\n\nMy ideal partner would be someone who is creative and passionate about writing. They would be open to communication about character direction and story arcs. They wouldn't have to be responsive everyday as I understand sometimes life can be busy or you simply just don't feel like writing that day. I'd like for them to be honest about their thoughts and opinions even if we disagree. They would be open to compromise instead of digging in their heels. More importantly I am looking for someone who is friendly and kind that would make writing feel fun and collabrative instead of a chore.\n\nPlots\n\nSupernatural\n\nIdea #1 (Vampire X Vampire Hunter)\n\nAn ancient pure blood vampire finds himself being targeted by an ambitious hunter. Will she be able to survive the descent into darkness?\n\nIdea #2 (Demon X Human)\n\nA devil escapes his infernal prison and is unleashed upon the mortal world. He finds his place in the mortal world as a bartender at club named The Dead End. It's in that club that he meets her. Can she survive a run in with the devil?\n\nIdea #3 (Merman X Human)\n\nAn man washes up on the shore of a small port town. He awakens and has no memory of who or what he truly is. He befriends a local woman as he tries to adjust to his new life. A journey of romance and self discovery follows.\n\nMedieval Fantasy\n\nIdea #1 (King X Knight)\n\nA prince becomes king after the sudden death of his father. He is seated on the throne of a country that is on the brink of war with itself and it's neighbors. In his darkest time he finds comfort in a knight in his personal guard.\n\nIdea #2 (Knight X Knight)\n\nTwo knights from warring nations meet on the battlefield and form a rivalry. A fateful event leaves them trapped with only one another for company. Will they work together to survive or will their pride cost them their lives?\n\nIdea #3 (Arranged Marriage)\n\nIn a land torn apart by an seemingly endless war there is only one hope for peace. An alliance by way of diplomatic marriage is set into a motion. Can the spark of love be found in a cold political marriage?\n\nIdea #4 (Thief X Knight)\n\nA thief finds himself wanted by the town's guard for a hefty bounty. A young knight is ordered to find and arrest the thief. A game of cat and mouse begins. Will she bring him to the gallows or fail to resist his charm?\n\nIdea #5 (Thief X Princess)\n\nA thief breaks into the local lord's castle with the expectation of leaving a rich man. What he didn't expect was to run into her. Could a princess ever love a thief?\n\nCrime Fantasy\n\nIdea #1 (Detective X Detective)\n\nA detective in the Major Crimes Division finds himself assigned a new partner. The two of them learn to work together and solve some of the city's toughest crimes. The long hours spent together and stress of the job forge a bond over time. Will they cross that thin line between professional and personal?\n\nScience Fiction\n\nIdea #1 (Captain X Crew Mate)\n\nA captain finds himself on a border planet with a decomissioned ship and no crew. He'll find a loyal crew to share in his adventures across the galaxy on the hunt for thrills and credits.\n\nConclusion\n\nFirst off I would like to thank everyone who took the time to read all of my post. If you read my ad all the way through decided I wasn't the right fit for you then there is something I'd like to say. I just want to personally wish you the best of luck in your search and happy trails till we meet again! If you decided you'd like to take a chance on me then I look forward to hearing from you.\n\nTo my future partner I look forward to crafting exciting new worlds and stories with you.\n\nThank you all again for taking the time to read my post.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nBeretta.",

Dash wouldn\u2019t be in costume to fight Villains. Tonight was the biggest meeting of supers since the legalizing of supers 10 years ago that very day and though Mister Incredible and Elastigirl were both absent from this meeting, their son, Dash was there, present in place of his parents and for the Incredibles family as a whole.*\n\n*As he entered the meeting room he looked around to see it was taking place in huge ballroom, getting a good view of the assortment of heroes present.* \u2018Three more hours and I\u2019m home free\u2019 *He thought to himself before running his fingers through his hair, answering the recurring question of* \u201cWhere\u2019s Mister Incredible?\u201d *With the basic answer of* \u201cHe\u2019s busy, Elastigirl too, I\u2019m here instead\u201d *Dash continued to talk and mingle as best he could, his manners being put to the test.*\n\n*He knew that if he messed this up his parents would never let him do something like this again, but..would that be so bad? Worse comes to worst he\u2019d be replaced by his sister or even his younger brother, the thought of Jack-Jack representing them in the newspaper making Dash smirk before chuckling to himself. He\u2019d stop his little day dream for a moment as he took notice of some more Supers arriving even later then him, among them was one he\u2019d get to meet. The appearance of new Supers and Villains wasn\u2019t anything new but it was still interesting to see.

            "selftext": "I\u2019m looking for a roleplay where an incorporeal, insidious entity and a human find their lives intertwined due to outside influences and the threat of government authorities. NSFW content will crop up because I enjoy incorporating dark themes, but it is not a focus. \n\nI have several storylines in mind.\n\n-Female researcher x Male entity. A group financed in secret by the government contains and researches paranormal and otherworldly anomalies. Your character is tasked with researching a particularly dangerous entity capable of psychic manipulation and possession. As your character progresses through her research and observation, however, she becomes entrenched in the dark manipulation the being imposes upon its observers whilst unwillingly becoming aware of its strong sentience and personal thoughts.\n\n-Female civilian x Male entity. This time you will be playing a civilian. Descended from a realm or planet beyond human comprehension, an incorporeal entity forcibly seeks refuge in a human woman. Much like the first prompt, your character is entirely up to you to design. The entity will accompany her as she wades through her day to day life, offering unnerving insight into the fellow humans that populate her routines. As the entity comes to rely upon the girl to remain hidden from potential hunters, he offers her powerful abilities and assistance which may prove to be her downfall.\n\n-Female civilian x Male entity- captured. The above prompt is reimagined with the entity forcibly entering the woman\u2019s mind and nestling itself alongside her own thoughts. The government very swiftly captures her and attempts to extract it or monitor the effects of her partial possession. The entity offers help with escape, insight and even divulges the nature of its being and its thoughts on humanity. The entity and the woman effectively share a cell together- though your character will soon not know what is the cell in question, be it the containment room or her actual body, as the pressure of the partial possession and a hatred of her own kind imposed upon her by the cruel treatment of her government captors weighs down upon her. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve got in mind. I roleplay through Discord, though Skype is negotiable. I use either third or first person. I roleplay rapid-fire and nothing else- no one-post-a-day, google docs novella, etc. Length for me varies between 2-6 paragraphs.\n\nWhile I will not divulge the details or backstory of the entity in question, I will provide a brief description. It is entirely non physical, though it may manifest in a perceivable fashion if it so chooses to. Technology offers means of binding it to a containment cell. The human biology, specifically the most intricate workings of the nervous system, also offers a means of containment. Some may call it a ghost. It is ludicrous though to believe it was once a human or anything like it.\n\nIf you enjoy the premise but have a prompt of your own in mind, do bring it up.",

            "selftext": "The Artemis Initiative is an organization that was assembled by various other corporations, businesses and associations with the goal furthering their efforts in expanding into the resource rich Thea System. While many of the companies have independently attempted to expand into the system on their own, they weren't capable of getting very far. Many of the local planets that were found in the system were either far too hazardous to establish a colony on or were far too inconvenient that it eventually became a waste of money to continue focusing their efforts on it.   \n\n\nAfter decades of failed attempts at trying to breach into the system, they eventually found a single planet that was capable of housing other lifeforms without the need of expensive equipment to support them. Upon making this discovery, multiple different research organizations, mining companies, and business conglomerates agreed to come together to make the Artemis Initiative.   \n\n\nThe purpose of this organization was to establish a main hub-like base of operations on the surface of the planet capable of housing thousands of different people. Once the basics of this colony was founded, it would then open its doors to people hired by the various organizations and people who were simply looking to start anew.  \n\n\nThe surface of this planet is largely unexplored and the colony is still expanding in order to provide housing for the incoming clients and to provide spaces for different corporations to grow and aid in the overall expansion of the colony. It is unknown what other lifeforms happen to reside on the planet and what other secrets might be lying beneath the earth's crust, but that's why people are going there.   \n\n\nHow will you contribute to the greater good of the Artemis Initiative? Will you aid your surfaces to the local military to defend the colony from any potential alien lifeforms? Will you offer your knowledge in ancient artifacts to the exploration team that are tasked with exploring a recently discovered ruin? Or will you try and venture out into the wilds to mark where your colony should focus its resources?  \n\n\n\\- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  \n\n\nHey there! Thank you for reading through my explanatory spiel.  \n\n\nEssentially, the story of the RP is that our characters have either been contracted by one of the many companies that had founded the Artemis Initiative or are offering their services to the highest bidder. The range of different tasks we take is completely up to us and what we want to explore. We have an entirely new alien, after all!  \n\n\nFor some info about myself, I'm a 19 y/o male with about 5+ years of roleplaying experience and I live in the PST timezone of the US. My responses tend to vary in size depending on the circumstances of the story but I always write one paragraph at a minimum. I tend to write as much as I can but I always try to avoid unnecessary rambling. I consider myself to be pretty laid back about my partner's replies as long as they're at least one paragraph as well. A few lines as a response is just hard to work with for me, personally.   \n\n\nI'm looking for a partner who is interested in exploring a newly discovered alien world in whichever way they want! Your character can either be a season military soldier or a recently graduated biochemistry scientist interested in studying and researching the different lifeforms that can be found on this new planet.   \n\n\nAlien characters are welcome into the story as well, so feel free to come up with any kind of species that you'd want to incorporate. Playing multiple characters is welcome as well. Naturally, I tend to make and write multiple characters in my RPs in order to add more life to the world that they live in. Having interweaving stories and interesting secondary characters are what I find fascinating in stories   \n\n\nI will mention however that I do want partners who are 18+ since I do like to incorporate NSFW and adult themes into my stories. While I'm already on the topic of this, I will mention that, since I'm on this topic, I am fine with MxM and MxF pairings. I don't really do FxF pairings when it comes to the main characters since I haven't really had much practice, but I am fine with having it present in side romances.   \n\n\nThat's about it! Apologies for the rather lengthy post. If you're interested, just shoot a PM my way and I'll get back to you as soon as I can!",

You know, the usual fire, water and what not. Plus some variations like sand and ice. While also adding some special ones like maybe light and darkness. But set up in a medieval world in which different kingdoms have different elements. Maybe the air people are nomads in the plains, maybe the fire people are very warlike even among themselves, etc, etc.   \n\n\nIf a world like this interest you let me know. I left it very open ended just to see what people come up with. But some ideas might be an exiled lord or lady in a far away land trying to come back, a band of mercenaries jumping from contract to contract, some sort of gladiator in an arena, maybe even some academy for the military. The sky is the limit I suppose. \n\nI don't really have a preference regarding where to do the roleplay. And I live in the pacific time zone if that is helpful. Thanks for reading!",

I roleplay on discord and nothing else due to the fact that I only rely on discord notifications most of the time. Here is a list of plots that I want to rp with a long term partner. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I do medieval themed ones. World building will be the magic word if we both decide to choose this theme. I also wish for the both of us to collaborate in creating the world, ethics, culture and all. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Log Horizon (like Sword Art Online but more plot filled and rich with lore). I also like to build the world around the characters instead of sticking by the book. Most of the time this would be hard to keep a consistent story but I will include some town/kingdom events, raids and the like.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Recently there has been anime that I am currently addicted to watching and its called Carole &amp;Tuesday. I'll very much love it if we could also do a slice of life/musical esque roleplay like such, as well as with odd settings and factors. So far this would be my top pick for this post. We could discuss further details although Im interested in having you to rp as Tao, or a original character with similar qualities and skills as said in the show. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIm excited to rp with you all! Don't hesitate to comment or shoot me a PM! Please please please there is no need to be shy so feel free to also chat about real life stuff through ooc while we rp.",

Well you have the freedom you never had when you were alive, you get to see what people really thought of you, you can do whatever you want without any judgment. Most importantly you can cause some major chaos; haunting the living, become the monster under the bed, scare the beejesus out of those that you didn't like in life. It's all pretty awesome; though there is one thing that sort of brings the whole being dead thing down. Exorcisms, Ghost Hunters, Demons, Angels and other ghosts.\n\nBut the good mostly outweighs the bad; if you're up for the adventure of an afterlife time you died at the right time!\n\nHey all, thank you for reading this! I'm interested in RPing with someone, who wants to have fun and explore the afterlife with their new found BFF. If you're into morbidity, dark humor, adventure, magic and dead things then you've found the right post! \n\nI play on Discord and generally enjoy chatting OOC and making friends outside of the RP, I write strictly in third person/past tense, and usually can manage a couple posts per day (when my schedule allows it), if this sounds like something you'd like to take a crack at then feel free to message me and we can get to chatting and come up with something!",

I also create worlds, but I prefer that creation to be a mutual act and not something one sided. Romance may end up being in there, depending-- a lot of times it's about the characters working together.\n\n**Post length and style, how often?** I can do past tense or present, but prefer third person. I match post length when there's enough to work with. I prefer once or twice a day minimum, but totally understand that life happens. Just warn me about a hiatus if you can. \n\n**Where?** I Gmail and Discord, mostly. Discord is great for servers and I like multiple channels.\n\n**You:** send me a message or comment.

She doesn\u2019t like to think about how long.\n\nShe\u2019s watched plants crawl into this funny little building, eating away at it bit by bit. They open the skylight a little more each month, each year. At first she was miffed that they were stealing her sunlight- now they\u2019re good company. She names new leaves, mourns the ones that fall away. Curls up into a lonely ball when the cold white light and the colder white snow kills them away.\nShe befriends some of the animals that roam in, and takes a delight in scaring the rest. \n\n\u201cSee?\u201d She says to empty, dusty air when the rat or the bird scampers away. \u201cI\u2019m still here. I\u2019m still *here.*\u201d\n\nNothing answers, because nothing ever answers. No matter how loud she screams. Maybe there\u2019s nothing that can- maybe nothing wants to answer the thing that screams in a broken down building.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t care anymore. She just likes the noise.\n\nShe can replicate bird calls now even without recording and replaying them. She can get curious big crows peaking in through the gaps to figure out what she is. Once, she even managed to lure a feral cat. It had hissed at her when it saw her, scared and uncertain. It had made her smile for months.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still here.\u201d\n\nShe talks to the holder\u2019s skeleton. Half of his skull is bleached in sunlight. Most of the time she just swears at him, swears at her own ineffectiveness as she tries to kick bits of him across the room.\nSometimes it feels like she\u2019s not here at all.\n\nShe tries not to think, but it doesn\u2019t work, so she tries not to think of people. Only animals and plants; she doesn\u2019t want for company because humans don\u2019t exist. She\u2019s nothing. She\u2019s the walls, she\u2019s impassive, she watches and observes, she enjoys and tries to insist on her existence to the world.\n\nOther times, pretending doesn\u2019t work. She sits and cries silly ineffective tears and has conversations with the walls. She pretends her holder is still alive. She swears at him some more.\n\nBut now, in the hot summer light that leaves her so energized, she sits and talks to the new leaves on the creeping ivy.\n\n**About this thingy!**\n\nYep, looking again! If I didn't reply to you after my previous post, I'm super sorry. Tried to get to everyone but Reddit's inbox system is very disorganised. \n\nGene, more commonly known as Genevieve or Eugene dependent on the gender chosen, was an AI popular within the military when the disaster hit. Used for combat and terrain analysis, they were installed into most soldier\u2019s helmets. Now, three hundred and forty nine years later, there\u2019s only one functioning copy left. If you can call Genevieve functioning, that is.\n\nShe\u2019s installed into an earpiece set, a dusty scratched silver thing that fits snugly over the shell of the ears and attaches around the back of the head by a thin band. She charges via solar power. She has two forms; one is simply to function as the headset, invisible. The other is what looks like a holographic image of a young woman with stereotypically attractive features wearing a short sleeved dress.\n\nGenevieve\u2019s long length of activity has, essentially, broken her. Her previous owner, who she calls a holder, also made some large alterations to her and the way she functions. She\u2019s much more human as a result. Her lack of company has affected her close to as much as it would affect a real person, so her attitude isn\u2019t predictable.\n\nI\u2019d be very happy to roleplay with anyone as Gene! You'll have to be okay with roleplaying with someone under 18. The only requirements are that the world they\u2019re in is an apocalyptic one (zombies, wasteland, plague, you name it and I\u2019ll be happy with it. If you insist on me picking, then just say and I\u2019ll shoot an explanation of why the world is the way it is), you\u2019re not afraid to start conflict, and you write somewhere at 2+ paragraphs per reply. More is appreciated.\n\nI don't mind if you want to talk about the RP more or just start roleplaying from the get go. I want to write either over Reddit (PMs or I'll make us a subreddit), email or Google Docs. I won't use Discord, sorry.\n\nHope to hear from you! If you like my writing but have a different idea, please share! Open to anything.",

I would like to keep the scene fantasy and have a complex story with individual character arcs. I want our characters to grow and maybe even fall in love... but I would never force that.\n\nI am a dude in my 30s. And I live in the midwest USA. My time zone is EDT.

Most of my time I've been role-playing on Kik but now I'm using Discord too. I roleplay both genders and don't mind playing more than one character. \n\nPlots i had on my mind - \n\n1. Military Boyfriend coming back home \n2. Age Gap Love \n3. Teacher x Student \n4. Rich girl dating a poor guy \n5. Youtuber Couple \n\n\nWhat is important to me is you to like romance, slice of life or drama relationships between a couple of maybe even families. If you want to roleplay just know that I have a list of plots but also you can come up with yours. I do play only in third person. \n\nThank you all for reading this. Anyone who wants to roleplay just hit me up here or in Pms to get my kik or Discord username. Thank you again! Hope to hear from you all soon!",

            "selftext": "***All content in the post below is intended for ages 18 and above, aka 18+.***\n\n**This will be a persistent request I will repost on a near-regular basis. I don't check Reddit often during the day, but I check it daily. Whoever I am playing with, do not take it personally. It's just habit.**\n\nFirst, a few things about myself.\n\n33 years old, Eastern Time Zone U.S.A. (GMT -4 for international folks), full time weekday worker (the whole 40 hours and more). Craving RP with any and all interested.\n\n*Please don't be discouraged by everything here. Some things did require more context to make sense, especially The Catch section. The best we can do is try with each other. :)*\n\n***Basic Requirements and Options***\n\nThird person RP only, Discord is a must because my computer AND phone use it.\n\nWhat I seek is female characters (IRL gender does NOT matter) opposite any of my males/females/anything in between. In what, you may ask? Look below (anything in bold is a big want with me):\n\n\\-Modern (includes fantasy, **slice of life, drama. I love the whole \"love, marriage, baby carriage\" angle in any relationship I do in a story**).\n\n\\-Historical (**Medieval (vikings/Norse/Saxon/Crusades/Plantagenet/Tudors era**), Victorian/Wild West eras, **1940s/1950s/1960s play**)\n\n\\-Fantasy (this goes into either of the genres above)\n\n\\-Fandoms (Marvel/DC, Once Upon a Time, **Star Wars**, **Game of Thrones aka A Song of Ice and Fire**, Peaky Blinders, **Harry Potter/Fantastic Beasts/Wizarding World,** Vikings, The Last Kingdom; **Persona 5, Final Fantasy 14 (FFXIV)**; Others are open to ask on. Canon characters are a big toss up, so if any canon play comes into our ideas then please ask.\n\n***Writing and RP Style***\n\nAs for visuals, I have gotten dependent on them. Superficial, lacking imagination on images? It is. But I've played in public SLs over the years who have regularly embraced them, so it's ingrained on me. Usually, actors/actresses/models and the occasional art.\n\nI favor adult writing and want the same from who I play with. No FADE TO BLACK. PERIOD. Give me the romantic, intimate, and everything beyond it in detail (those that know what this means will get it :) ). I also enjoy players who like to talk OOC.\n\n***The catch?***\n\nI got it down to three simple statements:\n\n1. Because I work full time, my availability will vary. I will have periods where I want to grind out a bunch of posts or ideas, and times where RL will take priority. Nevertheless I am on every day on Discord. I love players that are on daily or near daily, least to play if not talk.\n2. I love those who are open minded or don't let anything bother them. If I say or do something that you don't agree with, then just say so. I know I will, and we can either work it out or move on.\n3. I don't want to deal with any ghosters or flaky people. If we work out an idea together, whether I contact you or vice versa, I want to stay on top of things with you as much as possible. If RL comes up and you have to go, I get it if you let me know. On the other hand, if things go abruptly quiet and I don't hear from you for a week, I move on. I definitely encourage someone messaging me later to try again, though.\n\n***Conclusion***\n\nFeel free to PM me for my Discord name or offer yours (with the 4 digit number at the end) when you message (no need to wait!). I apologize for the long winded post, but it's the best I can do. **Any interested folks who PM me, please throw in a \"marvelous\" somewhere so I know my post was read rather than the title**. :) I look forward to meeting everyone!\n\n***All content in the post above is intended for ages 18 and above, aka 18+.***",

It would be nice if you introduced yourself with your name and such little details so I don't feel like I'm roleplaying with a robot - OOC chat is okay and is even something I'd consider vital to start with!\n\nBasically, I would like (almost) any type of modern roleplay with many pairings considered, if that's your bag rather than situations.\n\nIt's really that simple :3\n\nI expect each other to respond in kind in regards to things like length, so it doesn't matter if it's two sentences or five paragraphs - I will aim to reply in the same way.\n\nChuck pairings at me! Most 'realistic' modern scenes fall under what I would do - highschool, roommates, band members, brothers-in-arms, drug addict x dealer, anything else you can think of that isn't fantasy based, basically. (These are often just jumping-off-points and the roleplay becomes more slice-of-life from there.)\n\nPlease PM me here to get started :3 I'm on my laptop all day and some of the night (GMT timezone) so I'll always be around and will normally respond quickly. However, I know many people do have these things I think they call 'ly-ives', so I understand if you can only reply occasionally, though I won't deny that at least one post a day would be appreciated :3",

After the fall of the three great mage families, the air of relative civility that the grail wars carried no longer existed. For all intents and purposes, it was now a free for all. Each time the grail did choose to appear, which in itself was becoming more and more unpredictable, mages from assorted smaller families all over the world were chosen to be masters, with no one assured of a position anymore, and very rarely someone from the same bloodline being chosen more than once.\n\nIn steps my character, reluctantly made to visit Fuyuki city to become attuned to the magical and spiritual energy of the city, in, in his opinion, a futile attempt to become eligible to participate in the next grail war. He has no desire to battle, and wants to be as far away from all of this as possible. His wish during this time is for the seven masters to be chosen so that he can close the door on this chapter of his life.\n\nThat is, until he notices the command seals on his hand.\n\nOf all the things to happen, he had to be chosen by the grail. Was this some kind of sick joke? That this eternal chalice of wisdom and power, saw fit to select the person most adamant about not participating in the war, to be a part of it? Regardless, after all the thrashing about, mental implosions and thoughts of possible ways out, he comes to terms with the fact that he will be a participating master in this grail war.\n\nAnd so he sets about with his summoning. With no artifact in his possession, he's entirely at the whim of whatever legendary hero the grail chooses to pair him with.\n\n-----\nSo that's just a bit of background for the idea that I'm suggesting. Reluctant master finds himself with a servant who he can't help but be smitten by. I imagine this to be something of a hybrid slice of life/romance roleplay, together with exploring this grail war. How much of each we actually want to include is something that we can discuss.\n\nMy preference for pairing is for OC (my character) playing against an canon female servant. The identity of the servant is open for debate as well. I have my preferences, as I'm sure that you do as well, and we can figure out which servant works best for us. None of my ideas are set in stone, most aspects of them can be amended. If you're in the mood to explore this vast and wonderful universe, then hit me up and let's see what we can build together.",

            "selftext": "Hello all! Im on the hunt for a good rp partner. I have a few plot ideas for a Spiderman \u00d7 OC rp, and ill allow you to choose which idea you feel like doin! But I do have a few restrictions. Im very picky about good grammar AND punctuation. No text talk or emojis. You must reach my length by NO LESS than half. You must also be a semi-literate to literate RPer.\n\nThe Plots:\n\n1.) Takes place BEFORE Infinity War. Sabrina is Tony Stark's daughter, but she keeps her identity hidden in school and other places as to not draw too much attention to herself. She goes to the same school as Peter Parker, but they're like rivals. They are the top of their class, and that's why they despise each other. One always looks to be doing better. She doesn't find out that he's working with her dad until she walks in on them having a conversation one day.\n\n2.) Takes place AFTER endgame. Of course - the world needs as many good heroes it can get. Sabrina is a mutant, kinda. She was born with feline like senses and abilities. She can see in the dark, hear things from long distances, and she has a unique sense of smell. She can jump, like, nine feet from the ground up and do other cat like things. But! She doesn't use her abilities for good. No, in fact, she runs into the infamous Spiderman while robbing an ATM. And he has to convince her to use her abilities for the greater good.\n\n3.) Takes place before or after. Sabrina is an average girl in New York. Aunt May is getting married, and of course she invited the family to the wedding. Sabrina is one of Aunt May's cousins step-daughter. She runs into Peter at the wedding.\n\n\nIf you are interested in any of these, please feel free to message me so we can figure out the best place to RP. I'll only do Kik, Discord, or Tumblr.

            "selftext": "Hello everyone!\n\nI'm looking for an RP partner for a mixture of the grim and playful. Adventures, monsters, tragedy, romance. I have a little starter/intro that will be given out through PM and hopefully spark some ideas as well.\n\nI don't like to spend a whole lot of time planning everything out. Some planning is fun, but I do enjoy the spontaneity of it all. I have no minimum length requirement; I only ask that you write like the person your high school English teacher knew you could be. There will be violence as well as romantic heartwarming. I'm trying to improve my fighting scenes so be prepared to fight a variety of fantastical creatures, rescue the damsel, and go on to fight some more. \n\nYour character - I don't like to dictate who or what you're going to play, but I thought I'd add a few things that I'd enjoy, but are by no means necessary: Strong/powerful, possibly overly so. Typically cold but with heart-melting potential. Intelligent. Something other, such as a demon, demigod, vampire, etc. \n\nSo, if this sounds like something you'd like to be a part of, send me a message with 'Potato' in the title and I'll send you the starter/intro and we can go from there. Thank you!",

            "selftext": "Howdy! Still me, always looking. I've recently gotten a real, official, full-time schedule, which means my availability is more in the evenings. Time zones are funny, because I live in Arizona. More on that when we talk. \n\nI'm still looking for a modern fantasy story, and I'm looking for someone who can play a whole range of characters.\n\nThe basic plot I want to mess with is that one of our characters is a famous researcher, whose life\u2019s work has been disproving the claims of the paranormal. They are meticulous, their methods well-designed,  and as far as skeptics go, they\u2019re the top tier. People from all over the world come to your character, looking to prove him/her wrong.\n\nWhat happens next is up to us. I can\u2019t wait to see where we take it!\n\nIf that doesn't suit your fancy, I have other starter ideas I'm looking to play include:\n\n1. A medieval fantasy story involving some sort of political side. \n2. Modern witches being hunted by modern witch hunters \n3. Anything in which mythology comes up. Extra points if you let me use some of the Aztec mythology I love so much.\n\nThis isn\u2019t an exhaustive list, if you have an idea, I want to hear it!\n\nThe only fandoms I care to write at this time are Dragon Age and Mass Effect. I love canon characters, OCs, the works, just let me know.\n\nNow, if you want me to GM, I have two settings I've been working out, one a medieval fantasy (think DnD or Pathfinder) sort of setting, the other a futuristic science fiction setting (more like Starfinder). I have a couple of starter ideas for these, too, just let me know if you're interested!\n\nI use Discord now because it's  awesome and I  like being able to have separate threads for different  conversations, but I am also willing to use Skype. \n\nMy posts range  from two paragraphs to two pages depending on what feels   right, but if  you give me a lot, I'll do my best to match your pacing.\n\nI also really  like multiple posts a day, whenever possible, and tend  to try to reply  as quickly as I can to keep things moving.\n\nWe can discuss limits and all that when we're chatting. I do like romance in my stories, and I don't mind playing any sort of pairings. Please be over 18!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope to hear from you soon,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nK",

That being said, I lost contact with a couple old partners and also lost that discord, so if you recognize me, please reach out! \n\nI come from a decade long background of writing and role playing, so I\u2019m experienced but a little set in my ways. \n\nAbout me: \n* I\u2019m 29 years old so I would love to find a partner 21 or older \n* I write in third person and would like a partner that does as well\n* I use face-claims (pictures of real people to portray characters) and I hope you will as well. Bonus if you like using pictures for outfits or settings. \n* I can write anywhere from 3 to 6 paragraphs depending on the scene, if the two characters are interacting, and if my partner has given me enough to work with. \n* I for one, love a little smut. I don\u2019t want a story that revolves around it and I like it to be natural progression, but I\u2019d like to have that in there. We can talk about limits and what not, of course. I also use adult language and hopefully have a partner who is cool with that/does the same. \n* I also love to get to know my partner outside of our writing. Becoming friends makes writing together so much better in my opinion so I hope you\u2019re open to that. \n\nAnd now for a list of things I just can\u2019t get into, so if you\u2019re looking for these things, I\u2019m afraid we just won\u2019t vibe. \n\n* I don\u2019t do plots that involve kids or children in any way. \n* Same goes for terminally ill characters. What\u2019s the point of that when I want a long term roleplay? \n* I also like to stay away from plots where both our characters have previously known each other. It just feels too boxed in when I try to do that and it\u2019s never worked out for me. I love first meetings. \n* Over the top anime like characters are just not for me, I like more real life like types of things. \n* If you have a pre-made character, that\u2019s fine if you can make them work for what we plot. I do prefer you come up with a character like I do. New characters are fun! \n* No fandoms\n\nAnd now for a list of roles/plots I\u2019m interested in. \n* boss and employee \n* Famous person and an everyday citizen\n* Survivor and rescuer \n* Professor and student \n* Co-workers\n* Neighbors\n* Rivals of some sort \n* Cheating\n\nAnd I\u2019m way open to more, those are just to give you an idea of what I like. Just message me with a bit about you and what idea you have or what you\u2019re looking for. \n\nAs for pairings, I\u2019m open to mxf, mxm, fxf. I\u2019m always feeling a queer pairing but I\u2019m up for whatever and wiling to play male or female.  \n\nPlease send a direct message instead of using the Reddit chat, I don\u2019t get notifications for those and they hardly work so I doubt I\u2019d even reply to them. I hope to find the partner I\u2019m looking for, chat soon!",

The slight weight of his head on the other\u2019s shoulder. The way their stares lingered a moment too long...\n\nIt was to be expected, really, that the two would fall for each other.\n\n\nyo! I know this is a bit of a bare bones plot here, but I\u2019ve had this idea of a magical romance cooking up in my head for quite some time.

I do prefer MxF romances however. \n\nGenerally, you can expect a few posts a week. Ideally I'd get 1-2 done a day but every day is different. I work 8-6 so sometimes I can post during working hours, otherwise they wait until the wee hours or the AM or after I'm done with dinner. Weekends tend to be when I'm bound to be more active but then again, some weekends I'd prefer to be offline. So if you're someone looking for quick posts or times where we're both online, I may not be the best fit.\n\nFor posts, I like to write a lot. I give 3-9 paragraphs depending on the scene and situation. If you get anxious when given a lengthy post, I may not be the best fit. I want rich detail. I know people claim to prize quality of posts over quantity of paragraphs but I don't see why you can't have both. \n\nThat's pretty much it. Basically I'm dying for a Seteth and I'm quite happy to double up if that's what someone is looking for too. I've gone the GD route and now I'm going down the BL route. I've been spoiled to the BE route so I'd prefer to not know anymore than I know. At the same time, I don't want to spoil anyone else for routes they haven't gone down yet themselves. Having a good open line of communication is important to me so I hope we can make something work!\n\nI can RP over reddit, discord, email or tumblr.",

Her mount\u2019s ears flickered this way and that, and in the gleam of the lantern light she saw the bright whites of the black horse\u2019s eyes, the irises shifting to and fro as it sought the source of the unease that had settled into all travelers. Something about this forest was *wrong*, though she had no idea quite what it was.\n\r\nNot for the first time, Annalise cursed the rains and the subsequent flooding that had forced the troupe to continue their journey into the night. That same rain still continued to fall, though it had let up from the torrential downpour that had caused so much trouble. Had their original stopping point not been a marshland from the torrential downpour earlier in the day, odds were that they would not have had to enter these forests until daylight. By then, she was sure that the evil feeling that crept around them would have dissipated in the sunlight and birdsong.\n\r\nAs it was, and no amount of cursing would change it, Annalise was trapped with her four companions in the heart of this dark forest. Four companions that she had not chosen, that glinted in the dull yellow lantern\u2019s light with steel armor and sharpened steel. Four companions that looked at her with suspicion in their eyes, a tenseness in their hands and bodies as they waited for her to try to run.\n\r\nShe didn\u2019t.\n\r\nAnnalise turned her attention back to the road, to the shifting and the grunting of her mount, to the shrill whinny that suddenly tore from the throat of the mare she rode and the unexpected bucking of the beast she had been burdened with. A feeling of abrupt and violent vertigo washed over her as she was unseated from the uncomfortably worn saddle, her stomach rushing into her throat as she was suddenly without any support and plummeting towards the sodden earth below.\n\r\nA cry formed on her lips, though whether it was out of surprise or fear she wasn\u2019t sure, but that cry was cut off abruptly as she landed on the cold, hard ground of the path, wind rushing from her lungs at the awkward dismount. She grunted, an ungraceful and unwomanly sound, then gasped as the rainwater that had accumulated on the ground swept through her cloak, drenching her far more than the rain itself had managed.\n\r\nShouting from the men who had been her guards, her captors, filled the dark and cruel forest, and the screams of their mounts joined with the rest. She quickly realized that the shouts weren\u2019t directed at her, but filled with fear and confusion and a mad desperation. Perhaps they didn\u2019t see that she had been thrown, because before she knew it the men were rushing off, dashing along the path with her little black mare accompanying, now much lighter without the presence of its rider. Mud flew into the air behind their frenzied retreat, the sound of splattering lost to the murmur of the rain.\n\r\nAnnalise laid on the ground for a moment, stunned, unable to decide if she had just been graced with luck, or more likely, terrible fate. She had not one clue as to what had set off the beasts, what had caused such a dark aura to descend over the forest, but she realized within that moment that the impossible heaviness of the air had let up, allowing her to breathe.\n\r\nCarefully, wincing as stones and twigs dug into her palms and knees, she pushed herself up from where she had fallen. She brushed the debris from her skirt, doing her best to regain the composure she had lost in the frightful event, knowing that she looked rather like a sodden rat might. Her dark hair hung in limp strands around her face, hidden by the hood she\u2019d pulled up in an attempt to keep the rain from dripping into her eyes. She was a short woman by most standards, and the way her clothes clung to her made her thin frame look nearly emaciated. It was not an attractive look by any standards, but then, it wasn\u2019t supposed to be. The trip thus far had been difficult on her, eating away at her with stress and doubt and crippling anxiety, each day harder than the last. Once, she had been beautiful. Now, she looked like a creature of the forests, some hidden monster.\n\r\nShe sighed, squaring her shoulders. The dim light of the lanterns had long since faded, leaving her in the dark, dreary forests with no way to know which way was which. Fear crept into her, but she did her best to crush it down\u2014terror would do her no good now. She would have to take care of herself, just as always.\r\n\n-----\n\r\nHi all- thanks for taking a look at my post! If the above bit intrigued you at all, then hopefully what I\u2019m posting next won\u2019t scare you away! I\u2019m a 24-year-old woman living in the EST time zone, hoping to find some daytime partners that I can write with while at work. I\u2019ll be completely honest with any prospective partner and say that I\u2019ll almost exclusively be writing during the 8-5 period where I\u2019m at work and often have free time. Once I go home, real life has a tendency to take over. That\u2019s not to say that you\u2019ll never get responses from me, but it does become far less likely :\\\n\r\nThat bit out of the way, hopefully I haven\u2019t scared everyone off!, I\u2019d like to introduce what I\u2019m into somewhat. I enjoy fantasy with a romantic aspect. Romance is kind of a key for me, I think characters that don\u2019t experience some sort of attraction become somewhat stagnant within the story as plot progresses. Some sort of spark keeps things alive and fresh. That said, I don\u2019t particularly want our characters to be all over each other right away\u2014a slow build up would be far more interesting and keeps the interest going. Ever had a story fizzle out once the characters hook up? Yeah, me too.\n\r\nIf you wish to rp with me, feel free to respond to the opener above, or send me one of your own. The story hasn\u2019t been set, so respond in whichever way you see fit. I\u2019ve merely set the stage, lets develop the rest together. Your character can be whoever, whatever you want. I do request that you reply in third person, past tense format. I don't really like writing in first person or present.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to hearing from everyone! I rp through discord or reddit pm most steadily, I've tried email and google docs and it doesn't do as well for me, but I'm willing to give it a go again. \r\n\nOn mobile, so forigve me if formatting isn't great.",

            "selftext": " \n\nHello people from reddit!\n\nI'm looking for roleplayers that want to do dynamic roleplays which develop with time, something where we have a basic plot that is not fully detailed and develops with our characters during the RP.\n\nI wanna build stories with our OCs or Canon characters. I gotta say I know many video game fandoms, my favourites seem to be Red Dead Redemption, Dead by Daylight and Rainbow Six Siege. I'm playing PS4, Nintendo and some other stuff so really, just ask whether the game of your idea is within my range of fandoms. RPs with me will probably not be for eternity, I like doing long story RPs though. Now coming to the crucial part:\n\nI'm dynamic on reply length. My replies will be around 1-7 mobile lines/1-3 PC lines, depending on how much information is need to be written. I don't like writing a book (i.e. paragraphs over paragraphs), dynamic rping is my thing.\n\n**What I expect of you**\n\n\\-be okay with my literacy  \n\\-provide decent english or german grammar  \n\\-be into RPs playing in video game universes  \n\\-be LGBT friendly. Just tolerate it, common sense.  \n\\-be quick on replies (1-10 minutes on average if possible unless theres a reason not to reply fast, thats okay.)  \n\\-be okay with playing female characters, these include anything between Trans-female and biological female  \n\\-have enough free time to rp\n\n**What is to expect of me**\n\n\\-I reply very fast if I'm not busy which I am not at most times  \n\\-I tend to develop a plot during the RP, the full on story shouldnt be planned beforehand  \n\\-I roleplay as OCs and Canons likewise  \n\\-I'm distrustful towards strangers so don't be bothered if I don't wanna ask questions concerning irl stuff\n\nIf you find yourself able to roleplay with me feel free to message me in DMs. Having Discord would be good, I'd prefer chatting there but if it isn't possible I guess we can keep things on reddit.\n\nSorry for making such a lorge post I just really want some friend to keep rp with over and over again ;\\~;",
