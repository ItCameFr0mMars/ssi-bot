            "selftext": "Home to several ruling Kingdoms across the realm, Atrocaea is a high-fantasy world filled to the brim with adventure and rich history. A war nearly eight generations ago divided Atrocaea, a terrible conflict fuelled by racial, political, and religious dissensions. Issues that had been left to simmer beneath the surface had eventually erupted and the continent was left to burn. Brothers turned on brothers. Fathers on Sons... It was a wound dealt to their beautiful land that would never be forgotten, and in some cases\u2026 would never be forgiven. \n\nThe Inidion Dynasty, kept prosperous and stable due to the many mines that dotted their land, was vastly spared from the horrors of this war. While other kingdoms weakened each other with bloodshed, they only grew more powerful and eventually one of the most influential in Atrocaea. And in what is now known as the Unification, their men - fresh and eager - swept over the Kingdoms. Though many resisted fiercely, in the years to come all would fall under the rule of the Inidion family and with their reach, founded the first Atrocaean Empire with their patriarch sat at the throne. The lands, once ruled by ancient families, were distributed among the branches of the family. Their holdings appropriated to those who fought and died valiantly for the cause. And in so doing ensured their rule and peace for the entire continent. A peace that has lasted for almost two centuries.\n\nBut peace never lasts, and now the Inidion dynasty finds themselves beset from within and without, and at war once again. A human rebellion lead by the displaced Lords of Old and the Holy Sect of the Almighty Vahlis; The Fists of Vahlis have risen and proclaimed themselves the true rulers of the world. They seek to dismantle the hierarchy that has established peace and prosperity to their lands, and to destroy their Elven Overlords.\n\nWill you aid the rebels in their fight for supremacy? Or be the saviour bent on ensuring harmony between Kingdoms? Perhaps you're but a humble civillian who discovers a greater destiny, or even a survivor of the Crown Wars, in search of vengeance and bent on the downfall of the reigning family? The choice is in your hands.  \n\n\nThe Atrocaean Empire is a Discord-based Medieval Fantasy roleplay with themes from Elder Scrolls, GoT, The Witcher, D&amp;D, and more - allowing plenty of creative freedom when it comes to races and character creation. We are looking for serious, long-term players that are active, friendly, and able to write cohesive posts as well as willing to work with others to form plot and develop characters. While this group is not particularly NSFW, there are adult themes in play, and so we are only accepting players who are 18+.  \n\n\nIf interested, please message u/MadamRueRue or u/VacareAtorium. We look forward to meeting you!",

            "selftext": "Hi there! My name is Bailey (and once again I\u2019m posting this - sorry if it\u2019s annoying) and I\u2019m in need of some new partners, as I am always trying to expand. I use kik, discord, or reddit for my roleplay. As for what I\u2019m looking for, I\u2019m not clear on what I\u2019m looking for plot-wise, but I can tell you this: \n\nI love romance, and it\u2019s a definite must, whether it\u2019s FxF or MxF, and I always play female. I\u2019m into drama, action, dark themes, supernatural, slice of life, horror, adventure, and pretty much all of the above. My imagination has troubles when it comes to fantasy and magic, though. \n\nSome loose ideas I\u2019d like to try out currently are:\nMafia/gang.\nFBI,\nEspionage,\nSports related, \nEtc \n\nSome fandoms:\nThe 100,\nPeaky Blinders,\nThe Vampire Diaries, \nSupernatural, \nQuantico,\nThe Society,\nAnd maybe a few more \n\nThose are just a few, but I\u2019m welcome to any ideas or plots you may have. \n\nLet me also mention this: I\u2019m not looking for a sex-based roleplay, but enjoy including it into the story as it fits, with an appropriate build. \n\nMy preference for style is 1st person, but I can do 3rd as well. I don\u2019t care about post length, and think a paragraph is just fine. I cannot find 2+ paragraphs fun, as I feel like it hinders the partners\u2019 abilities to move the story along. Although, when starting a new roleplay I can definitely see where length is necessary. It\u2019s just easier to bounce off of replies when they\u2019re shorter, especially with dialogue. \n\nIf you have any prompts, plots, or ideas you\u2019d like to discuss or roleplay, send me a message so we can get to creating something together. I hope you took time to read this, I tried to keep it short, so if you have any further comments/questions, message me! Thanks, Bailey.",

I\u2019m pretty flexible about the genre and the theme so if you have some ideas I\u2019d be happy to see them.\n\nI am flexible but a hard limit for me is any fandom. I don\u2019t want to roleplay in a world that has already been built. It\u2019s difficult for me to be creative in that kind of scenario. If you want to create a world with me inspired by something like that, I could be flexible.\n\nWhat I\u2019m really craving is fantasy. Dragons, knights, priestess, sorcerers etc. That sort of thing. As far as plot I enjoy building a backstory that is deep enough so that areas of their past can act as a catalyst for plot development. I prefer an unstructured plot.\n\nI like to roleplay on Discord. My average writing is about 3-5 paragraphs. On discord it typically runs over their 2000 character limit.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested send me a PM and we can exchange Discord tags.",

The whole '*getting-to-know-you*' trope is boring, contrite, and can easily be explained away with a bit of planning and brainstorming.  So come prepared with your own ideas as to how and why our protagonists crossed paths with one another, and we can get to the good stuff all the sooner.  :)\n\n\\[Which I am practically starving for at this point.  Like I said, I'm sick of checking this subreddit on the daily and coming away more and more disappointed with every visit.  I get why everyone likes Discord for OOC-stuff, but it's insufferable for those of us with a penchant for formatting, editing, and keeping track of all our lovely prose.\n\nYou guys should try it for yourselves sometime.  You'd probably even, dare I say, *like* it.\\]\n\nIn addition to the plethora of information that can be found by following [this link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NB0lwdANbuL8zNsw2OgI9Mjo95koRMIbPU_pDbxMs4k/edit?usp=sharing), which I ask any interested parties to have read *before contacting me*, the following three (3) points are of the utmost importance to me:\n\n1.  You're able to reply daily or every other day.  3-4x/week is preferable as the longer the stretches of time that occur between replies, the more likely our partnership is to suffer from writer's block, disinterest, or a combination of the same.\n\n2.  You're comfortable speaking up if the partnership isn't working out.  I'm not your mother, but I expect you to extend me the same courtesy you'd want in return if any of your partners suddenly felt their talents were best utilized elsewhere.  We're all adults here, so if you're the type of person to up and leave without bothering to say as much to your partner, please do not message me.  I am as reasonable as the next person, but ghosting is extremely rude.\n\n3.  You enjoy sharing the workload of brainstorming, world-building, and altering the sandbox to better accommodate our muses.\n\nStill with me?  Thanks for getting this far.  I'd offer you a cookie, but I'm a terrible cook.  And I really, really just want to write, so you'll have to forgive me for not having some store-made ones readily nearby.\n\nIf I've somehow managed to pique your interest, drop me a PM, and we'll go from there.\n\nThanks for stopping by.  I hope you and I are able to make some magic together, but if not I wish you the best of luck in your own respective searches.\n\nCheers,\n\n\\-Izu.",

            "selftext": "Hello to all of you lovely lurkers and fellow roleplay subreddit subscribers! I\u2019m back again with another post because I\u2019m currently looking for someone to fill the role-play void in my life for the next two weeks before my classes start up again. (I would also be interested in more long term stories if we click, or a series of short ones, just try me!) Before I explain some of the ideas I have in mind, let me elaborate a little bit on myself. I\u2019m a 22 year old female who enjoys playing both genders and in most cases can write multiple characters as well. I prefer to write MxF stories but will consider other pairings if the story warrants it. The only thing I\u2019m not flexible on is perspective styles. I write in 3rd person and expect my partners to do the same. As far as length goes, I average anywhere from 4-6 paragraphs but am capable of doing much more when the situation warrants it.\n\nI am perfectly fine with NSFW content of all natures as long as it is discussed before-hand. If you\u2019re looking for someone who writes pure smut, we probably won\u2019t work well together. \n\nWith my boring yet obligatory introduction out of the way, let me get into some of the prompts:\n\n  - **Horror/Sci-Fi :** I\u2019ve really been craving something in the style of Welcome to Night Vale or Gravity Falls, but darker. If you haven\u2019t heard of either of those, the central idea is a small town that is home to all sorts of strange happenings. The cause of these events ranges from paranormal to extraterrestrial and there\u2019s a number of ways that we can approach this. [Lovecraftian horror and suspicious/menacing local government figures galore.]\n\n  - **Mythology:** In a slight twist on the abundance of posts referencing medieval themes and settings, I have some rough ideas for a story centered around Norse or Greek mythology. In this universe there would be gods and demigods, as well as runic magic and mythical creatures! (Think along the lines of the God of War franchise. I can elaborate much further over PMs)\n\n  - **Renaissance/Gothic Era Misadventures:** I don\u2019t have an exact prompt in mind for this but I\u2019ve always had an interest in the Italian Renaissance era and setting. Assassins, philosophers, soldiers, and cultural revolution; there\u2019s just so many options. I\u2019m open to almost any historical themed story so if you have something in mind, I might be your girl. \n\n**Fandoms:** I\u2019m not looking to follow any canon to a T right now but if you\u2019re looking for a fandom role-play or just want to get a better idea of the themes I\u2019m best at writing, I figured I would list a few more things below:\n  - Red Dead Redemption\n  - The Witcher\n  - A Song of Ice and Fire\n  - Days Gone (I love apocalypse tropes)\n  - The Twilight Zone (short stories, anyone?)\n  - Labyrinth\n  - Annihilation (UFO contact sights, research scientists, and black ops) \n  - Tanis/Archive 81/The Black Tapes\n  - Silent Hill\n  - Many, many more that I\u2019m sure I\u2019m leaving out!\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nWoooo, that was a long one! I tried to sum everything up as short as I could but I have a lot of ideas right now and it\u2019s hard not to ramble. If there\u2019s anything I forgot to add that you think would be of interest, don\u2019t hesitate to send me an orange envelope! The worst I can do is say no or suggest some changes, right? I\u2019m also available on Discord and Google Docs.\n\nCiao!",

I know lots of people are busy nowadays, but hopefully we can find sometime to develop a really fun and interesting story that satisfies any cravings we might have!\n\nA little about me. I\u2019m a 22 year old girl from the East Coast United States and I\u2019m about to start my last year of college. I\u2019ve been roleplaying for quite a while now, and I think I\u2019ve gotten pretty good over the years. Most of my experience came from internet chat rooms and playing dungeons and dragons!\n\nI roleplay in the third person, typically write in a paragraph format, and enjoy lots of descriptors of settings, emotions and everything. I like it when I can really sort of picture the scene in my head and maybe also feel what the characters are feeling.\n\nI enjoy mostly any kind of roleplay. But recently I\u2019ve been into this idea of a dark fantasy sort of roleplay. The main premise would revolve around your character a more respected, virtuous, and altruistic  character, and my character who would be more malicious, deceiving and ruthless though not necessarily evil. I really like NSFW work themes, actions and settings as long as it\u2019s not the absolute focus of the whole roleplay.\n\nThat\u2019s about everything, hopefully I hear from you and we can work something out. I\u2019m usually on Discord, but if that\u2019s a problem I\u2019m totally willing to move to a different place! Thanks!",

I have no idea. Before I get into the nitty gritty, allow me to say a bit about myself. I'm a 20-something male with plenty of writing experience, about 6ish years or so. I'm the kind of guy who (proudly) sprouts absurd and out there ideas, literally just on a whim or the slightest bit of inspiration. Seriously. Sometimes I can get a little crazy. My post length is anywhere between 1-3 paragraphs, but I came definitely get more out if I'm feeling inspired.  I'm also, for whom it might concern, in the central timezone of the United States. That being said, I have a horrid sleep schedule, so I'll usually be up pretty late into the night.\n\n\nWith that out of the way, let me say what I'm looking for. I am (unsurprisingly) looking for a female partner to nerd out with, 18+ of course, just in case we *do* go down a NSFW road at some point (It's welcome, but I'd like to not to be the focus of anything). **I will not, under any circumstances, write with someone under the age of 18**. I'm not comfortable with it, and I'm sorry if someone out there disagrees with this. Additionally, I'm looking for someone that I can call my friend. All proper and business is boring. I like to freak out with my writing partners. Come up with dumb plotlines or AUs. If you're looking for something strictly professional, I'm probably not your guy.\n\n\n\nFinally, we get down to what I'm *really* gonna be vague on. As you might've guessed by the title, I'm looking for something fantasy related. What specifically, you might ask? I have no clue. I'm a sucker for romance plots, with an epic adventure hanging above our characters' head. Be it slaying gods, or sealing away an ancient evil, I can't get enough of it. I love all sorts of different fantasy races, too. Elves? Oh yeah. Demons? Sure! Any kind of Yokai? *my god, that'll press my buttons in juuust the right way*. That being said, anyone that brings an idea with **Kitsune** as a major emphasis will make me *very* happy. Anyway. If you have any existing ideas, please, throw them at me! I love reading through plots n ideas. Want to create something new? We can chat for a bit, and see what we both like.\n\n\nI'm rambling now, aren't I? I think I've gone on for long enough. If I've caught your eye, please, shoot me a message, and I'll get to you ASAP. I get a lot of messages, so I'm sorry if I don't get to you right away. Some messages also slip through the cracks, or don't follow a certain obvious rule, so sorry on that regard as well. Just be sure to include your favorite color in your title, so I know you got down this far. I won't respond without it, because I don't enjoy it when people don't read my post. Like I said, I'm usually around into the late hours of the night, so you'll likely catch me. Thanks for reading!\n\n\n(Oh, by the way, don't send me a message only saying \"hey I think we can work something out\" or the like. Tell me about yourself, have some energy. Those kind of intros give me life)",

A distant relative of yours passed away, unexpectedly leaving their large estate to you. Among the many rooms of this mansion, there lays a library with many books. It becomes apparent, however, that the library has magical properties. Each book in this library acts as a portal to another world, enveloping you with its characters, story, and plot if you allow it. After accidentally entering one of these hidden worlds, an old fantasy novel, you come across a dragon! He's friendly, brave, reckless and has a way of finding trouble! After helping this dragon, he becomes your loyal friend. Perhaps you can take him back to your world? Maybe you and the dragon can hop between worlds, undergoing a variety of neverending adventures, or maybe you can help the dragon in his own world? The possibilities are endless!\n\n  \nHave you ever wanted to go on an adventure? Experience life in other worlds? Make tough choices that impact a rich and developing story? How about having a dragon companion? Look no further!   \n\n\nI am looking for a DEDICATED roleplayer to play a HUMAN that befriends a dragon. You must be open to roleplaying in a variety of different settings and genres. That being said, this rp is based entirely on your actions and will impact how the story progresses. Keep that in mind! ;)  \n\n\n**Finally, I am looking for a roleplayer that again, is DEDICATED. I am looking to rp just about every day for great lengths of time. I provide timely but detailed responses and would expect you to do the same. Let's keep it moving! :)**   \n\n\nRomance disclaimer: This is an 18+ rp so if you want romance in the story, let me know. I'm okay with it as long as it isn't forced and makes sense.  \n\n\nPlease send me a message if you are interested. Bring your ideas and questions too!

            "selftext": "Hello hello! Hoping to find a few solid partners for some cravings I've been having lately. You up for it? Sweet. Let's get to it.\n\nFirst of all, the ground rules. I'm not going to get all heavy with this because honestly, they're just about the same as everyone else's. I'm 27 years old. With that being said, I'm only looking to work out stories with people who are 21+. I'm trusting you with that. Don't let me down.\n\nI write in 3rd person only, otherwise I get creeped out, and my posts can typically range anywhere from 3-5 paragraphs if there's a lot of dialogue or we're looking for a more casual RP. If we agree on something more detailed, well...then expect more. But, also expect that it'll take a little longer for me to get a reply out.\n\nI can't do sci-fi stuff, man, I just can't. Best I can give you is some light fantasy stuff, but we're going to need to work together on it. My niche is more realistic - whether that be modern or historical (I'm kind of a sucker for historical).\n\nFinally, and this is probably going to turn a lot of people away, but I would really prefer to actually write in Google Docs. We can chat OOC there as well. It's just the easiest way for me to stay organized and I think it's easier to develop a story in that platform.\n\nAlright, with all of that out of the way, I'm going to go ahead and list some very basic pairings/ideas I have here. I have more detailed ideas for each of them in mind, but I'm happy to flesh them out with you. Or, if you don't see something on this list that interests you but you still want to write together, shoot me a message! I'm always down to brainstorm.\n\nAll pairings will be MxF. I'm always down to write secondary characters, and in fact my RPs usually have several of them. Life typically doesn't revolve around just two people, right?\n\n**The Farm Hand**\n\n(Civil War Era)  \nA young man is forced to separate from his parents and siblings to go work and live on a wealthy, thriving farm. Set in the Great Plaines in the Depression-era, his parents had to sell their own farm and go find jobs elsewhere. Now, he's a farmhand for one of the wealthiest families in town. From plowing fields to milking cows, nothing seems to be off-limits. But, the pay is decent and he can send most of it back to his hungry family.\n\nNot having a lot of money to begin with, the man's education wasn't exactly a high priority as he grew up. So much so, in fact, that he never went past the 5th grade. But, there's a difference between being uneducated and being stupid. He was simply uneducated. Reading and writing weren't his forte, but he was extremely street smart, and knew everything there was to know about farm life. Even though this new living and working situation was different, he knew he could be content there.\n\n  \nEven more content, he found, when the farm owner's daughter was around. She was as beautiful as she was kind - unlike the hot-headed temper her father seemed to have, especially with his employees. It wasn't as though she got her hands dirty much, but whenever she did come around, she offered a warm smile and a few encouraging words. Once in awhile, she would even bring cookies and fresh sweet tea. It wasn't until the young man saw her reading one day, underneath a shady oak tree, that he became even more intrigued with her. After a short conversation, it didn't take long for the young woman to realize the young man wasn't a skilled reader. So, she offered to tutor him in different subjects whenever he was free. But, would something more eventually develop between them? How would her father feel about his farmhand wasting time with books? How would he feel about his daughter associating with such an individual?\n\n**Secret Service**\n\n(Modern)\n\nY/C is the first elected female President of the United States. M/C is a member of the secret service. I don't want to get into much more detail than this because I think this is one that really should be fleshed out together.\n\n**Hiding Place**\n\n(WWII Era)\n\nThis is very loosely based on the film *Suite Francaise*, but with a few twists. Either a German soldier gets injured and finds his way to the secluded farm home of a young Jewish woman (early twenties - perhaps widowed?), seeking refuge.\n\nAlternatively, it could be an American soldier - which would change the dynamic completely.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-------\n\nAnd now for a few more lighthearted plots. I think a little 'fluff' is necessary once in awhile, but I certainly don't think that means lower quality!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Cabin**\n\nTwo strangers fall victim to an accidental double-booking at a cabin in the winter. What will they do?\n\n**The Tree Farm**\n\nY/C has car trouble and finds themselves at M/C's family Christmas tree farm - stuck for a few days\n\n**The Volunteer and the Vet**\n\nActually, as I was writing the title for this one I thought it could go two ways. My first idea was someone who worked at an animal shelter and a veterinarian...but I suppose it could also be a veteran!",

I'm all ears to any ideas, though I do have a few of my own for anyone interested. If this is something that would interest you, feel free to send a message my way and we can talk more!",

            "selftext": "Hey, I\u2019m a 20 year old guy who has done quite a few roleplays since I was 15 and I\u2019m looking for a partner who would be interested in a long term rp of a love story in modern times between a prince falling in love with a common guy. My inspiration came from having recently finished Red White and Royal Blue which had a similar vibe. I don\u2019t have a ton of rules about the rp but my preferences are that it\u2019s written in 3rd person, it\u2019s done on discord and preferably (at least in the beginning stages) it\u2019s more focused on developing the plot and romantic interactions.\n\nMy idea for the plot would be something along the lines of a prince who is tired of living a complete boring royal life and does little escapes from the palace disguising himself as much as possible as a normal guy to try and do normal activities. One of those days he meets a guy and clicks pretty well being friendly and somehow flirty to each other and even exchanging phone numbers until someone recognizes the prince and ruins his disguise. From there on the guy starts to act turned off and rude to the prince since he disliked the royal family for how fake they seemed. The prince instead of getting offended and turned off by the other guy\u2019s sudden disinterest and rudeness finds it fascinating that there was finally someone who didn\u2019t immediately get head over heels for him just because he was the prince.\n\nFirst off thank you for reading all of this, I know the plot idea is a bit rough at the moment so I\u2019d definitely be thankful for suggestions and improvements that you might think for it. If you got interested by the idea then please PM so we could discuss it and give you my discord username.",

This is an rp where you\u2019re creativity comes into play, come up with new planets and systems for the crew to explore, come up with cool aliens (there is dedicated channels for both of these things) for them to encounter as well as let your writing determine how the story goes. There\u2019s no big main plot so the characters action truly do determine the course of the story without the stress of having to do a certain action at a certain time that occurs with set plot. Replies must be written in the third person (or literate as it\u2019s probably more commonly known) and have correct spelling and grammar. The amount that gets written however is up to you, whether you want to write endless paragraphs or just a few sentences it does not matter. The rp will hopefully be long term but if you find yourself unable to stay or you\u2019re just not enjoying it, please don\u2019t feel like you have to stay just for everyone else\u2019s sake. Life happens and comes first before rp. While i\u2019m Okay with NSFW stuff happening please keep in mind that it is not a NSFW only rp, also if you\u2019re trying to do it with someone who is underaged you\u2019ll be reported and kicked out.I will also not allow nor tolerate people being bullies or harassing one another. Everyone is welcome to join this rp no matter what and there is a motto that I stick by and follow: no one can change your character unless the change is one by you. Not hard to know what that means. I\u2019m open to discussions and any ideas you have about the rp itself so please do not hesitate to message me at all. I\u2019d like at least four or five people just to start the rp off and i\u2019m Fine with requests to invite any friends who you think would like to join but PLEASE ask me first. If any of this tickles your fancy please let me know.",

In Estria, the supernatural are shunned in the most tolerant cities and hunted down and killed in the worst.\n\nSanctum is a place that operates under a few basic rules, just to make sure everybody gets along swimmingly. Characters can join communities, start businesses or become an employee somewhere.\n\nInformation on the RP (style)\n\n1. To start off, the RP will be very slice of life, just mostly refugees going about their business. As the staff team grows  and if the RP takes off, this might change.\n2. Most fantasy creatures are permitted, or even a regular human if they have a reason to be in Sanctum.\n3. Characters don't have to arrive only as the author does. If their history reflects it, maybe they've already been in Sanctum for some time.\n4. The Mayor-role is taken by me - the GM. Council roles and sherif (like) roles are not yet all taken.\n\nTo start, the discord will have navigational channels, and parts of the city to RP. Every active character will also get their own \"house\" channel to just chill in their house. There is also a lore channel, which will have a map of the town.The server will not allow NSFW in the IC but there'll be 1 or 2 NSFW channels where you can go nuts.\n\nWhat I need to get this going\n\n\\- Players\n\n\\- Supporting staff\n\nSo yeah, please let me know if you'd be interested by upvoting or commenting. if I have at least 3 people interested I'll post a link to a discord.",

I\u2019m female, but I can play either male or female roles. I can do almost any genre as long as the plot is interesting, but these are the ones I\u2019m most interested in: science fiction (particularly cyberpunk), horror, and historical. But right now, I\u2019m mostly interested in historical settings (the 20th century, but the 1940s/World War II in particular). It\u2019s not a requirement, but I\u2019d like to include a romantic element if possible. I\u2019m also really interested in a potential horror scenario inspired by Lovecraft. I\u2019m 18+ and can do NSFW scenarios, just as long as it actually benefits the characters and/or plot. My replies tend to be shorter, around 1-2 paragraphs, I hope that won\u2019t be a problem.

I do have a life outside of rping and do like talking ooc with my partner. I can and will throw memes and headcanons about our characters at you all day.\n\nI am currently looking for someone familiar with My Hero Academia, you don't have to be familiar with the manga, just the anime is fine. I'm looking to do some **OCxCanon** pairings and expect my partner to double up. (I play your oc's love interest and you play my oc's love interest alongside playing our ocs.) 3rd person, past tense, no one liners, you get the gist. Also, just to be clear **I do not write smut**, it's just not something I'm into and it would take a lot of convincing to make me write it. My preferred platform is Discord since it's easy for me to use and navigate.\n\nI have a few plot ideas in mine and hope to hear from you. PM if you're interested!",

            "selftext": "## The Antium Empire\n\nAntium is a medieval fantasy roleplaying server set in a land ridden with conflict. A land forcefully taken over by a former military general has left the kingdom and it's towns in a state of disarray. Corruption and crime riddle the land both on the surface and beneath it. Even where it seems peaceful, deep within the roots of every nation corruption runs deep. Set in this world, its' to your character to pick what they wish to do. A land full of opportunity, whether to take advantage of the many in need, or to provide them with the help so desperately seek.\n\n\u00a0\n\n## What is Antium?\n\nSo, let's break down to what Antium itself really is! Antium is a place for those who are looking for a controlled roleplay with an enjoyable story, player connection, and adventure across the large area that is The Antium Empire. Now, of course, there are restrictions that keep the server running well and ensure that characters do not go overboard with their powers and abilities, stray away from edge-lords, and there are a few things that tie into the lore of the server itself. Things like a set list of magical affinities one can obtain, but do not worry these are mere guidelines and magic is not solely limited to this set list and you could just speak to one of our staff about more! \u00a0\n\n## What makes it unique?\n\nSo, what exactly makes us different? What makes our community and roleplay experience something different from other servers? Well, we run off a custom lore and background. This is meant to mean that no other server holds such an environment. Though, in the case of Antium's uniqueness, it entails that no other server will contain the lore we have, the aspects we do, or the set land and its social environment and dangers the way Antium is. This server is set for a more larger-scale roleplay hence due to it's larger map and variety of channels, this means the more the merrier, but this has not broken roleplay down and there are locations to act as hubs for characters to rest back in and converse with one another which will help stray from boredom of being alone in the vast lands!\n\n\u00a0\n\n## What are the 'requirements'?\n\nSo, what are the requirements? We ask that be able to speak English fluently and have a proper understanding of what serious roleplay is! This isn't a place either to go make a PC that can turn into a 76 headed snake that can spit out goblins and giants. There is, of course, a bit of reading to be done when coming into the roleplay in the information provided, but it ensures you know everything you need to! \u00a0\n\n## Tl;Dr\n\nAntium is a new fantasy roleplaying community that provides a unique lore and background for characters to enjoy, along with a friendly community of players within the Discord. While new and small, we hope to build up a playerbase that will allow for the best experience and a large diversity among the characters. The roleplay is set for a more large-scale environment, but roleplay contains hubs as to prevent boredom from character failing to be near one another. It's the perfect place if you're looking for a new active server to get into that holds a unique sense and feel to it! We hope to see some more new faces coming to our community!\n\nDiscord Link: [https://discord.gg/EEbjSyj](https://discord.gg/EEbjSyj)",

I was bitten by a radioactive spider and for five years, I've been the only Spiderwoman. But it wasn't always like that. The Spiderman of my universe isn't a hero, or even an antihero. He's the most dangerous supervillain in all of New York. I had to discover my powers on my own, and they're nothing like the usual ones. Well, that's not exactly true. I can climb walls and have the spider sense, sure, but there's more. I also have an active camouflage ability, and blades that come out from under my wrists. Maybe that last part isn't exactly a power, but it certainly helps. \n\n\"Moving on, you're probably wondering why I'm telling you this. Well, it's simple. I kill spider people. When I mastered my powers in my universe, I used them against our Spiderman, but it wasn't easy. Our fight destroyed several city blocks, hundreds of casualties. But I didn't even get a moment to relax. As I was catching my breath, something weird happened. I was taken from my rooftop, thrown through...something, and came out into an electronic billboard. I don't know where I am now, but something tells me it was for a reason. Could there be someone else like me here?\"\n\n*I know that's really short, but I watched Into the Spiderverse again today and decided to try using my Spiderwoman again. I can answer any questions you have in private, but first just a few tips to increase your chances with me.*\n\n*Don't use the chat system.*\n\n*Put effort into your initial message, make me want to roleplay with you.*\n\n*Have questions ready when you message me.*",

Others spend their lives dreaming of escaping the confines of St. Michel Parish and seeking their fortune out in the wider world. Time seems to pass slower here, though it\u2019s a matter of perspective whether this is a blessing or a curse. Every street and building is rich with history, which some wish to immerse themselves in, while others wish to escape and make a fresh start. Some see the signs of a town with a heyday long past, while others see the hope of renewal in once-derelict buildings finding new purpose. The night sky is vast and a profusion of stars shine out from the deep darkness, making those who dare to look up feel very small indeed.    \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;But above all, under its sleepy veneer Bethel is a place where things happen. There is a strangeness that most long-time residents seem oblivious to. There are local legends that everyone seems to know about but nobody wants to talk about. Old scandals and crimes from the distant past have echoes in the present. And out in the forests and the bayous, there\u2019s a certain feeling in the air once night falls that reminds the primitive parts of the brain of the days before humans were the planet\u2019s apex predators.    \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It is a place where scary stories told in the dark might actually be true. \n\n\n\u265a Advanced/literate paragraph - novella style Southern Gothic role-play.   \n\u265b Dedicated, active, and helpful staff.   \n\u265c A welcoming community of like-minded writers who are 18+.   \n\u265e Subplots created to seamlessly integrate new characters and get them involved right from the start.   \n\u265f A writing sample/past role-play sample required upon entry.    \n\n\n[https://discord.gg/WpHP2tc](https://discord.gg/WpHP2tc)",

            "selftext": "First of all, a bit about me. I am an experienced, mature RPer who has a number of years of experience in different formats, including face-to-face, email, forums and the like. Primarily, I am interested in character interaction and development, especially through storytelling, conversation and relationship building. I like to see well developed, well thought out and believable characters. I prefer exotic or unusual settings, primarily science fiction, cyberpunk or post-apocalyptic. \u201cReal world/slice of life\u201d scenarios aren\u2019t that interesting to me; if it's something like a military or espionage setting, maybe, but not something 'mundane'. With that being said, I\u2019m open to ideas if they\u2019re original or creative or a little unusual.\n\nI generally like well-written, well thought out posts, and definitely prefer quality over quantity. I don\u2019t want to read a novel with each post, but I don\u2019t want to see one-line-wonders. Similarly, I am a stickler for grammar and spelling and punctuation, although I am prone to the odd bout of ferocious typos myself. However, as long as the intent is there, then I\u2019m happy.\n\nMy interests lie in mutual storytelling and creativity, rather than playing along to somebody else\u2019s story or the like. I control my character, I decide what\u2019s going on with them, I create their background and so on. I ask for my partners to respect that, as I will do the same for them. Likewise, I will never launch a major story element or a plot twist or the like without okaying it with a partner, as I would expect them to do the same for me. If I do something a partner doesn't want, then I'll gladly change it, but I ask that they will do the same for me.\n\nI\u2019m flexible as to settings and backgrounds. I am currently looking for **Sci-Fi**, **Cyberpunk** and **Post-Apocalyptic** RP in original settings. I am also interested in fandom RPs based on **Star Wars**, **Battletech/Mechwarrior, Shadowrun** and **Fallout**. I am **only** looking for one-on-one RP, not groups\n\nIf you are interested, please contact me by **PM**. I will not reply to messages posted here or chat requests",

I don't expect someone to be available 24/7 but if a couple days slip by between replies often enough I'll lose interest.\n* 21+ and I'd prefer you to be at the very least **18+**. It's more comfortable for me, especially if adult themes come into play.\n* I've been writing since I was a kid on Neopets ~~zoinks~~ and I prefer **nothing under a paragraph**. My comfort zone is about 2-3 but I'll give what I get, and I can work on pages if I'm handed 'em. \n* I cannot, for the life of me, handle writing in first person. I'm at ease with **third person** but the tense isn't a bother.\n* I'm 99% disinterested in writing canon/oc unless I can really be wooed into it and the same goes with heterosexual ships. I'm queerer than queer *but* on occasion I do find a ship I can vibe with that isn't in my wheelhouse. Just sell it to me, but don't be disappointed if it isn't my thing.\n\n*Big Mood* Fandoms: \n\n* **Persona 5** \\- \\[ Ships \\] Most. No kidding. Throw it out and see if I'm into it. I've mostly been riding the Crow/Joker &amp; Skull/Fox trains, but I'm always down to mix it up. \\[ Characters \\] I'm interested in writing Goro, Futaba &amp; Yusuke, but I'm flexible.\n* **Watch Dogs 2** \\- \\[ Ships \\] Marcus/Wrench. \\[ Characters \\] Wrench. \n* **Borderlands** \\- \\[ Ships \\] Rhys/Jack. I know. I'm a mess. I'm open to other ships as well, 'cause of course I am. \\[ Characters \\] The company man himself. Rhys. But I've also got an itch to write Zer0 in some circumstance. I'm a sucker for a masked character.\n* **Apex Legends** \\- \\[ Ships \\] Most with a specific leaning to Mirage/Bloodhound. \\[ Ships \\] Just like I said, I'm a sucker for a masked character. Bloodhound, and Octane. I can be tempted into writing Mirage, and a couple others. \n* **Detroit Become Human** \\- \\[ Ships \\] I'm honestly open to nearly everything in this fandom. Surprise me. \\[ Characters \\] Connor, RK900, Marcus. Maybe Gavin Reed if I'm feeling in the mood. \n* **Spider-man** **Game** \\-  \\[Ships \\] Peter/Harry. I have some heavy need to explore the reveal at the end of the game. I would also dig some SpiderGwen/MJ. \\[ Characters \\] Both. \n\n*Maybe* Fandoms: \n\n* **Stranger Things** \n* **Marvel** \\- Comics, MCU/Netflix canon, Sony\n* **DC** \\- Comics, DCEU \n* **Overwatch** \n* **IT** \n* **JJBA** \n* **BNHA**\n\nI'm also open to original content if you can come to me with a complete idea or a willingness to suggest/plan it together. I've had too many situations where the other person would simply agree with what I said, and it doesn't build a scenario we both end up happy with.   \n\n\nI don't know if I came across super selective, but I'm not, and I'm super flexible. There's also a bunch of things I adore that I can't list right now off the top of my head so even if it's a long shot ask me about your fandom. *PM me with questions or with your discord name*.",

            "selftext": "Hey! So a little about me, I've been doing roleplay for almost 20 years, and I've seen it go through a lot of stuff! I prefer third person past tense, and working with someone to create a something really based off of what happens with our characters, I'd rather let their decisions lead where we go then a plot that we've decided and have to force in. I really don't like it when someone godplays and creates situations where my character has to do something. Also while I'm totally cool with there being things about a character that aren't shared, please lets build the plot together so that you aren't DM of the whole thing.\n\nI like playing romances, and like playing them realistically, with characters that aren't perfect, make mistakes and that sometimes those mistakes have long term ramifications within the line, and have to make the relationship work. That being said the character development between the two characters is one of my favourite things, and I do prefer to work with that. \n\nI'm open to playing doubles as well! I've always done it and really enjoy playing two characters, while I rarely use female cannon characters by and large I'm open to playing a lot of male cannon characters!! I don't care about your actual gender as long as you're happy playing a male character!\n\nI tend to play F/M pairings but am also comfortable with M/M!\n\nThe Cannon I'm most comfortable with is Harry Potter, and would love to either play OFCxCannon or completely play new characters in the universe! If we're doing OFC/Canon then I'd love for someone to play Draco Malfoy for me,and I'm open to playing most male characters for you! The only real exceptions are Snape and Ron Weasley or Harry Potter. My favourite thing to explore is the idea of the pureblood worlds after the war, dealing with the very real issues or the high society wizarding world having to change with the times, as such I tend to play after the end of the wizarding war or in another era entirely.  I would also be open to doing something from Percy Jackson. \n\nIn terms of original worlds I do like slice of life, historical fiction, and like light fantasy but I am open to any sort of ideas you have! I do love history and would love to play something in the eras of either Regency or Victorian. I tend to like playing with class differences as a form of conflict as opposed to a big bad.\n\nThis is my hobby and I like to have fun, playing with characters and having a creative outlet, I get that we all have crazy lives and understand that it won't be just constant back and forth, but I do try to reply when I have time to give a good response and hope the same of my partner! I work odd hours and have a weird schedule but am available when I can be. \n\nI prefer Discord!\n\nPM me to talk more! I like to get a good idea of characters and then start with the roleplay!",

But hey, let's give it a go.\n\nBeen listening to this song on repeat lately, and I think it'd make for a pretty cool story. I know I want it to be in a historical setting, but exactly when is up for grabs. Could be pre-Civil War Antebellum era, could be WWI-era...willing to work on this bit.\n\nThe big 'plot point' here is the classic trope of classism. A man who develops strong feelings for a woman he can't have, for a variety of reasons. I'm picturing a farmer's/plantation owner's daughter, and maybe some kind of hired farmhand or local handyman. Maybe she's already seeing someone or betrothed to someone, maybe their pedigrees are just too different, etc. There can be a lot of different ways to insert some drama into it, and that's what I'd like to brainstorm with you!\n\nFeel free to send me a message if you're interested in working with this one out. You can check out my previous posts for more general \"rules\" and what I prefer, but here's some of the basics:\n\n\\- 18+ (Preferably 21+)  \n\\- High-casual/advanced (Novella-style posting - 3rd person)  \n\\- Okay with adult themes (hence the 18+)  \n\\- No anime for face claims",

I've got a plot here that puts a twist on a cliche I see a lot around Roleplay communities. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasically the plot involves your character being sold in an auction for...purposes I can't state here without the bot auto-deleting my post. My character, who was born into a rich family, decides to help your character out when passing through the area where the auction is being held. Your character is sold to mine, but realizes the true purpose for being bought. She (I'd prefer female characters but male roleplayers are more than welcome!) realizes that he's actually there to give her a whole new life! He helps her get used to normal society, helps her recover from her past, and perhaps romance forms along the way!   \n\n\nI can explain it a lot better through PM's, so send me a message or comment here if you're interested!

            "selftext": "Heya! I'm glad I got your attention here, and hope I can keep it throughout. I have some extra time that is now predictable in available hours now that I've returned to largely regular work shifts, and a massive want to write even more than I am with my current stories- so I'm looking to add another few onto the roster :3\n\nI'm a multi-para to novella writer, only short when situations arise for shorter replies. I also love to get novels in return. Grammar and spelling is kinda important, not that I'll get fussy over occasional typos and strange wording. I'm also a user of Discord since it's really handy to have different channels under one server. I can be talked into GDocs but I'd like to say that you really need a way to ping me in that case because I can *easily* blank and forget to respond if I don't have an alert. \n\nDetails! \n\n* 23 years old gal and fine with romance/NSFW\n* I'm one of those ones that likes to let a story roll organically when it comes to NSFW, not forced!\n* EST Time zone- I'm happy to play with someone from any zone, though!\n* I basically work full time; it's hard to predict, but I'm usually out by 4pm EST. \n* If I'm working, I might be able to get a short reply in. Or a long one, if the manager is nice and it's slow.\n* Preference for long-term stories\n* Life happens, I'm patient for a story that I've fallen in love with. Just please keep chatting too! \n* I'll play in just about anything, with a preference for semi-realistic.\n* Can post novella size responses. I routinely go over the 2K character cap on Discord. \n* Loves to read. Please, write me novels! I adore it! \n* Third person, past tense. The usual here! \n* I'm pretty good about grammar but typos do like to slip out. (I also intermix variations, like color and behaviour)\n* Lots of characters- I prefer female roles (naturally) but I have males that I'm not against playing. \n* Any pairing- I'm all good with whatever's thrown at me. (I'm kinda feeling like some MxM lately)\n* Likes to throw said characters under buses. Expect lots of angst. \n* I'll roleplay most things that aren't ponies. Though I am a furry, I'm not interested in playing them.\n* I like to draw so I may draw things\n* Discord is preferred, but I also have Telegram. I can run in Reddit pm's as well and can be talked into Docs (just not preferred)\n* Cursing is all good, I use it mildly.\n* I try to reply quickly- sometimes I might be out of it, tired, at work, but don't fret. If it's been a while feel free to poke! Please, do poke- sometimes I honestly do forget. \n* I'm generally stable in what times I'm available and I like that in my partners as well.\n\nTo add in about messages: I want you to write. As said, I'm looking for people that enjoy the long term novella stuff, those who like to let the world build up on its own and let things occur organically instead of forcing something in for sake of doing it. I like to make plot points to play out down the road. I want to see some body to your inquiry! A long message is attractive on its own to me, even if it's just fawning over your character or some idea for a plot line or something. If you're on a time crunch then do say so, otherwise super short cut-and-dried responses won't garner interest from me. \n\n\nIf you like me so far, feel free to message me! I really prefer to see a message over everything else. I'm open when it comes to genre, as long as it's fairly realistic! I'm down to play in your worlds, in mine, or create something new. I'll jot down a couple little things to give you an idea of my writing and what I'm after. \n\n\n~\n\n\nRight now, I have two very particular itches to scratch. Firstly is based around the book Poet Anderson, and it was a beloved roleplay before my partner up and left and deleted the roleplay with him! I grew to adore my character Eve, the story developed so much, it was going along so well. I dearly want to play Eve again. If not in the Poet setting, Eve is otherwise a scholar of biology, animal life in particular. She lives in the countryside to make her research easier- she has a bad leg from injury out in the field. Though disabled she keep going, telling herself she'll get it fixed one day. What I want here is to start SoL styled then for Eve to find something else in the environment, which inevitably sucks the both of our characters into something much, much more fantastical than thought possible. \n\nThe other is playing as Zivantiaxe, or simply Zivanti / Ziv. He's a half devil of a human mother, of which has since succumbed to age. Ziv is Captain of the ship *Ripwrecker* to a crew that seem to get along well with him. Though, he is a creature of deceit and trickery, and does like to stir up a little trouble here and there. As a half devil, Zivantiaxe does possess a canine skull in place of his head along with claws and a tail. However he can change his appearance to be much more attractive- mostly to move among unwitting people, but he won't hesitate to use the looks for his own gain. Though not close to the governing body of the underworld as he's a halfblood devil, Ziv does have rules to follow. \n\nI'm also going to go to bed here, so don't fret if I don't respond right away. Write me up a long post and I'll 110% get back to you!",

I am looking for someone who won't ghost or disappear without telling anything because I had that too many times. I expect at least a paragraph as a reply and not just a sentence.\n\n\nAs for the plot, I have an idea in my mind and I do have my character (Also a ref). I'll let you create your own character and we will see where we can take the rp after we discuss and share our characters. I want you to create your own character because It makes is more interesting and unexpected than if I choose your role. I am both okay with you playing both Female and Male character. Also, you should be willing to rp as NPC's as well (so will I)\n\nThe Rp\u2019s I want to try:\n\u2022 Any Military/Army related rp\n\u2022 Riot/Protests\n\u2022 Special Forces \n\u2022 If you have any suggestions I am open.\n\n\nThanks for reading and I hope you are interested in roleplaying together, please write your fav colour at the title of your message so I'll know you read it all the way through the text and not just spamming.\n\nBye~",

I don't mind how many replies you get in per day, as long as you tell me if you're going to be busy for a certain period!\n\nThe theme doesn't just have to be modern. We could have a medieval fantasy, a supernatural theme, or sci-fi. If you have any ideas, I'd love to hear them! Any certain plots you would like to do, or any certain characters you would like to play out, I'd love to hear them.

I am looking for a writer of female characters (writer themselves IRL can be any gender) to write to a specific theme / setting.\n\nAt the moment I am most interested in the following: - Modern Day (real life) - Select fandom settings (Overwatch, Final Fantasy, Warcraft, \\****Sword Art Online\\****, League, any kind of MMO-like setting, etc.)\n\n**What I'm looking for (Someone who...)**\n\n\\- Has at least a little bit of an idea of what they want to write and in an RP partner.\n\n\\- Writes in the third person.\n\n\\- For Fandom setups, preferably plays OCs - but this will vary depending on the scenario.\n\n\\- Is at least moderately accurate with spelling / grammar.\n\n\\- Is hopefully okay with making a friend outside of the roleplay. \u2661\n\n\\- Is patient and understands that life happens, so sometimes posting frequency will vary.\n\n\\- Is okay with NSFW themes - this can be discussed in PM, please include this in your introduction.\n\n\\- Is okay with each of us just playing a single character (no doubling, etc.)\n\n**What I'm offering (About me...)**\n\n\\- I am a cis-gendered female who is in her late 20's and can either be entirely RP-focused or someone who is willing to chat OOC. \u2661\n\n\\- I can write decently well with roleplay; English is my first language and I can either be pretty descriptive or I can be more general, depending on both the scene and my partner's style.\n\n\\- Post length varies based on what is going on and sometimes can be a sentence or two (interaction between characters) or it can be a paragraph or two (I am usually not very long-winded unless it is an opener)\n\n\\- A few days each week for dedicated RP time with a few times sprinkled here and there for more random endeavors.\n\n\\- I am told I have little filter; I can be very forward, blunt, even painfully honest at times so someone who is good at sugar-coating things is probably not me.\n\n\\- Yes, the Canadian stereotype can be true, and I can sometimes be nice to a fault, so I ask that my partners are mindful of that and don't take advantage of that trait in me.\n\n*If I have piqued your interest at all, please PM with any questions! Include your favourite holiday of the year if you do please; even better if you include plot ideas or your own Discord to contact you!*\n\n*\\*\\*No Reddit Chats please!\\*\\**",

            "selftext": "Hello Reddit,\n\nI know everyone skims, and I have a good deal to say. I'll try and break this down into manageable chunks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Who am I?** I am a long term (decades plus) player with experience on a multitude of platforms. Nowadays, because that is what the crowd seems to want, I am primarily on Discord. I'm male and play exclusively male characters against exclusively female ones. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What am I looking for?** I am looking for a long term, dedicated partner who can (more importantly - wants to) keep up with my pace and general quality. I'm more than happy to exchange samples and talk in detail to figure out if we work first and would rather have one partner I am completely mad over and post regularly with than five or six I could take or leave and don't drop more than a single post a week for each. If things really work, multiple stories, or finishing one and starting the next, are both on the table. I'm into the very slow burn, heavy on the details and gradual on payoff side of things as well and like a story with a structure that is built to last through a big, cinematic arch. To get that, a partner who I really connect with is key. Long term in this case actually means long term.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Length/Quality:** When roleplaying, I normally set up a server with channels ooc/ic, roleplay, bonus material, images, so on, but we can chat first via DM and establish we want to move forward before getting to all that. My length tends to wobble between around 500-2000 words, but can be much less in a quick dialog exchange, or much more if opening a scene or on a particular tear. It is less a specific length requirement I am after than a match on style. I think our story should read like a novel with a flow to the words, a beginning, middle, and end, and a plot that keeps us wondering what will come next. As such, I usually like some planning and a solid premise that kicks action off without pre-determining \\*everything\\*. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Story/Characters:** As far as the type of story, I am pretty open. With the right partner, there are few things I wouldn't at least consider. Zombie apocalypse? I'm down. I have ideas (and hope you do too) and preset stories/characters, but I'd either like a lot of your input on fleshing out and how to start, or to full on meld our ideas into one. As such, I'll likely pass on anything too pre-built and suffocating, but be really into brainstorming out our likes and dislikes (maybe our existing characters) into a story together. As a matter of course, I tend to play male characters with some degree of internal conflict. Ideally, the story should force them to grow and explore some of their inner workings as well as trace the path of external forces acting upon both protagonists.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Genre:** All that said, right now, I am feeling something that circles modern, but maybe in a not so far off decade. Mid-century to now, maybe before the advent of smart phones made everything too easy. Perhaps a slight future with low-tech improvements and a few interesting sci-fi elements. Romance and some of the slice of life elements are also good and deeply enjoyed so long as we also include some action, adventure, and mystery into the mix. I prefer dark elements. That doesn't mean everything as to be \"gritty\" (though I like grit, too.) However, expect mature themes, violence, and all that sort of fun stuff to be featured heavily. I won't be interested in anything less than heart wrenching and I like exploring the gloom, darkness and angst which extraordinary circumstance can lead to. I like sad stories, and tragedy. I like adding in villains and NPCs that we can juggle between ourselves. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Character Dynamics:** I love conflict, butting heads, and then growing and coming together the most. Opposites that attract are a particular favorite when we can play against deeper similarities while still having plenty of things that keep them scrambling. I like characters that are challenging and also have some depth. No one is just one thing, and characters shouldn't be either. Extra, massive, big time bonus points if you go for a character image that is even just a little outside the box from the slew of blonde runway models I usually see all the time. Anyone that looks and acts different from the pack, has a few flaws and weaknesses, and stands apart would be a welcomed breath of fresh air.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Bonus Material &amp; Pacing content:** Big stories are my thing, and I hope that my partner is into finding face claims, dropping regular bonus content, and more importantly - posting regularly. Multiple times in a session would be ideal with the definite understanding that not every day can have hours dedicated to RP. When we can though, that's pretty nice. After many attempts, I've learned that the one post every day or two, or even less, is not for me. I need to be able to put some time in so I can feel like the story is progressing at a reasonable pace and so I can become attached and comfortable with the characters. What helps with the gaps in between real sessions is filling content in other ways. Maybe shorter form \"texts\" between characters while in separate places, or adding more media content. I am a fan of journaling and using character imagery or scenery shots, even music, to help set the mood and would prefer someone who is as into this as I.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Communication:** I won't ever pry into your life or creep, but I would like to feel comfortable enough with each other as writing partners that we feel at ease confronting issues. If something isn't working, let's talk about it as a team. If you just aren't feeling something, no hard feelings - just say so. Beyond that, I want to be open and encourage questions and regular pauses for story discussion, fawning, and re-hashing. You might get the drift from this long rant that I like to get granular and make sure this is all *just right.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStill interested somehow? Not scared off or turned off? Amazing. Message me and we can exchange Discords.",

            "selftext": "Hello &lt;3 \n\nI'm a 19-year-old female, hoping to find a serious rp partner, who also happens to know a bit about/be a fan of RDR1/2. Also, someone who enjoys slow replies and can also provide long, detailed multi paragraphs. \n\n* Long term would be purrfect too due to college/work, I'm not able to provide fast replies, especially during the daytime. I also encourage my partners not to feel rushed to make things fair.\n* Continuous short replies will result in the rp coming to an end. \n* If you have trouble creating large amounts of info and if you message me about it, I'm sure we can work something out. \n* I'd like to add NSFW topics but we can discuss them further through DM.\n\n# Characters.\n\n**I have a rough drawing of the appearance of my character, I wouldn't say it's enough to be a ref sheet but I'll happily show it if asked about as well as provide a description of her.** \n\nYou can play as one or more characters throughout the rp. You can also use your own oc or rp as an original character(s) from the games. I will be rping mainly as my female character. We can leak characters backgrounds during the rp or be straight up about it before, or both c: \n\n# Plot.\n\n**If you have an idea or would like to change part of the plot to better fit your character then please go for it.** \n\nBeing creative and improvising is obviously desired and allowed \n\n* I want this plot to be based within the RDR2 map: Referring to towns, the city, well known NPC's, and landmarks.  \n* But that does not mean you have to base your character entierly within the RDR2 map: For example, my character is from abroad but immigrated to America, we can also involve made up places too of course. \n\n**The main plot idea:**\n\n* My character is an Outlaw from Roanoke Ridge. She has been chased from the East and into Big Vally (We can change location to better fit your character if you wish) by a group of bounty hunters. \n* This outlaw has a nice reward on her head and is easily identifiable if in the wrong place at the wrong time due to her scarred face. She has been separated from her partner also.  \n\n**Your character does not need to recognise her, I have provided some basic ideas on how they could run into each other but again if you have an idea then do let me know.** \n\n* Your character is camping in the wilderness when they cross paths, perhaps she could attempt to rob your camp.\n* Characters cross paths within the town of Strawberry (Area can change if you wish). Buying supplies, at the stables, or even a bar within the hotel.\n* Our characters will form some sort of relationship, depending on who your character is and if they will get along. Surviving together, if the relationship is good, she might ask your help to rid her from the bounty hunters that are hunting her down as well as get back home and find her partner.\n\n**Extra Info.**\n\n* **Everything will be covered through the discussion before we start the rp.** \n* **NSFW topics can be involved but will require discussion first.** \n\n**Contact**\n\n* If you are truly interested in this rp or have any questions/just want to discuss it more then please DM me. Do not leave your username to other platforms within the comments or it will be removed.\n\n**Thank you for reading and apologies for the amount of info I've supplied. :3**\n\n**I hope to hear from you soon!**",

I write in third person and tend to write somewhere around 2-3 paragraphs depending on what the scene calls for right then. I am currently looking for the following prompts, though if you have an idea I would also be open to hearing that as well.\n\n\\-Online Famous. Both our characters are internet famous whether through Youtube, Twitch, another platform, and meet through interactions both online and from different conventions.\n\n\\-Comic Con. Our characters keep meeting at big conventions and end up bonding over shared interests. They can be big deals at their local conventions, or completely new to the scene, or just drug along by some friends.\n\n\\-Literally anything modern slice of life is up my alley. I have a whole list of vague ideas for this that I would love to share.\n\n\\-Modern Fantasy. Give me witches and those with powers and werewolves and vampires. You name it.\n\nHope this catches your interest! Shoot me a message if you want to talk more.",

I specialize in para-RP style third-person roleplays. I tend to write a bit of smut but the story is also important to me I tend to write 60/40 story/smut. I have no issues with multi-shipping either as I am polyamorous. I could care less about your gender, only that you are 18+ if you are going to write with me.\n\n**Preferences/Characters**\n\nI tend to write Connor, Rk900 (nines), and Gavin Reed. I love AU's, such as reverse au where androids are humans and humans are androids. My top ships are Reed!900, Reed!800, Hancon, GavinxHank, Honestly any type of combo including poly ships; but as I stated before I'm open to all ships. I tend to play males and play better when I am writing M/M. If its M/F I will admit the smut is going to be very lackluster and blackout time skip.\n\n**Reply Speed and Length**\n\nI answer pretty frequently. If I won't be responding quickly I will let you know as I do work full time, and sometimes there is just no will to write. I don't expect you to match my length as long as you write at least a small paragraph.\n\n**Writing Preferences:**\n\nAnything smut must be consensual between the characters.\n\nAU's I Love: Alpha/Beta/Omega, Royal, Coffee shop, Vet, baker, ect. Honestly, I'm down for anything if we can think of a plot for it.\n\nIf you have any questions or desire to write with me please DM me.",

We are first and foremost a mature community of 18+ literate roleplayers looking to add more quality writers to this world! We write anywhere from novella to a minimum of paragraph length, offer clean organised OOC chats, and a team of dedicated and responsive staff.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven though our lore is fairly extensive, it is split in a way to ease access for new characters in must-read and optional sections. We welcome original characters who are looking for a natural progression through Lush be it through learning magic, acquiring magical items or accessing high society in a moderated way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the pitch : \"Lush, a magocracy established in the eye of what the council named 'The mist'. A complex, self-sufficient chain of guild-ruled mega districts. It floats amongst a dense fog, held by magically powered devices lining the city's edges. Since it is made of an agglomeration of different districts connected by large magical bridges, there isn't a direct way in, or out of it. Anyone that comes or leaves must be either summoned, or banished by a mage. The arcane arts play a major role in the life of nearly all of its inhabitants, and while tech in itself was never really let aside.. most innovations combine a certain amount of engineering, and spellcrafting. As a result, Lush is stuck in an era of its own, replacing most of today's convenience with magical means, yet dropping any significant tech past the medieval era in the process \\[...\\]\"\n\nIf you are interested, here's the invite link: [https://discord.gg/hQVRyZd](https://discord.gg/hQVRyZd)",

I am a literate and experienced, mature-age roleplayer who has played across multiple platforms including chat, emails and even MMOs. My interests lie in both the small-scale character building and the large-scale worldbuilding that accompanies it.\n\nWhat I am looking for in a partner is somebody similar who has a similar approach to mine. I believe that two way communication is key to success in a RP relationship and that the players should not only engage with each other, but also feel free discuss and suggest plot, story and worldbuilding ideas.\n\nI am looking for something specific with regards to my character; I will be playing a MtF Trans character. What stage of their transition they are at is open to negotiation, but regardless they identify and present as female.\n\nI am interested in original worlds and settings based around Cyberpunk, Sci-Fi, Post-Apocalyptic and Low Fantasy genres. I have a few basic ideas I can work from for each of these, but I am also very much open to ideas and collaboratively building a world. I am only looking for one-to-one RP, not group games. I am not averse to including NSFW elements, but only as a part of the story, rather than for the simple sake of it.\n\nI prefer to play via email or Discord. If you are interested, please PM me. I will not reply to posts on this thread or chat requests.",

I've loved it from the moment I read the opening line--Margaret Mitchell's writing is beautiful and evocative and I have always striven to recreate her style in my own writing.\n\n...all of this to say, I really want to find a partner who will help me re-imagine this story. What if Scarlett realized early on that she wasn't really in love with Ashley? What would happen? I'd love to find a gifted writer who will portray Scarlett and help me answer these questions.\n\nBefore you PM me, here are some guidelines:\n\n\\- 21+ only\n\n\\- Novella/Multi-Para writers only\\*\\*\n\n\\- Must be willing to submit a writing sample\n\n\\- Google Docs for IC, Discord for OOC\n\n\\*\\* Before I scare you off with the 'novella' tag, just know that, while I go ham on introduction posts, **my average reply is closer to five paragraphs**.\n\n**I do not hold my partners to any kind of a post schedule.** I, myself, aim for 2-3 replies per week and would appreciate a head's up if my partner intends to go for more than a week or two without a reply or OOC contact.\n\nPlease PM me if you are interested! I need to find a friend with whom I can nerd out about this book. ;\\~;",

Currentley looking for:\n\nSomeone able to play Rose of Sharon Cassidy/ Cass from Fallout New Vegas (Because its so hard to find someone who can)\n\nAs for Marvel, I have an idea that requires someone whos able to play X-23 as well as know about Gabby/ Honey Badger and Rouge, its just an idea, ask me for details\n\nAlso if you know at least Fallout New Vegas and 4, feel free to hit me up, please have a knowledge of both, just because most ideas end up going to vegas is all.\n\nNow, I live in New Zealand, that's just for timezone purposes and I prefer to use discord.\n\nI've been role-playing since 2013-2014 And I try to have as much detail as needed, so hopefully I don't disappoint.\n\nHopefully some of you will be interested and I'd be appreciative toward ANY applicants, also I'm generally looking for people who can play females, you don't NEED to be a female, just able to play Females.\n\nFeel free to send me any queries or anything, I'll try my best to answer any and all questions!\n\nWell, hopefully I've interested some of you, hope to hear from you soon!",

NSFW and adult themes likely...but those things are no fun without a good story for context. While I do have some story prompts, I would generally prefer to work that out with my RP partner.\n\nPlease be able and willing to either NPC or play more than one character. I am. It is very difficult to have a good story with only two total characters.\n\nGenre preference: Fantasy or dark fantasy strongly preferred. Sci-fi if it is more Star Wars and less Star Trek. Modern only with a fantasy twist and if the world is particularly interesting. Cyberpunk is rad. Runepunk is cool. Give me some fantasy and I'm in generally. Super heroes? Strong maybe. \n\nI play through discord primarily. Send me a message here and I will send you my contact info.\n\nThanks for reading, and hope to hear from you!",

The idea I have for this is that our characters will go through countless adventures, while we take turns being the DM. For example, for one adventure I'll be the DM while the next one someone else will take that role. It would function pretty much like a live D&amp;D group.\n\nNow, I'm a beginner with the game, both as a DM and as a player so patience and tolerance it's appreciated. This is open to all players, both new like me or more experienced ones. The campaigns and adventures will have the support of the discord bot Avrae that will handle the rolls, character sheets, initiative and all that for us.\n\nIf this interests you, PM me and we'll talk about it.",

I generally am available to reply at least a few times a day---but I'm not too picky about my partner's reply time. I know that real life comes first! I'm also a huge fan of character development and slow-burn, so even romances usually take some time to develop with me.  \n\n\nAnyhow: I'll cut down on the wall of text and drop some plots!  \n\\-----\n\nThe Kingdom of Elysia, a war-torn country nestled in a mountainous land of eternal winter, has recently announced a new heir to the throne following the tragic death of the previous crown prince: Prince Aquilard I, youngest son of King Cygnus IV, will one day be king. The announcement is not met with the usual jubilation, however: at only 22 years of age, the new crown prince's hot-headed, boorish nature and skill with an axe has earned him the moniker, \"The Butcher Prince.\" It is no secret that he is more at home on the battlefield than in a throne room, but duty has called him back to lead his war-weary people into a new era rife with uncertainty.... to the anxiety of the entire Kingdom.   \n\\------\n\nI'm looking for someone who's willing to RP with my character! ***I'm open to both M/M and M/F,*** though I'd like to emphasize that ***my own character is male.***  Some possible (but optional!) plots I've thought of so far are:  \n\n\n1.) The King calls forth the best knight/vassal in his service to act as a personal 'guard' of the Prince---not so much to protect him, but moreso to keep him in line and (hopefully) out of trouble.\n\n2.) In a bid to end centuries of warfare, an uneasy alliance is to be sealed by way of marriage between the royal children of the warring nations. \n\n3.) During a night of sneaking about the town, the (now-disguised) prince encounters someone too interesting to ignore.\n\n4.) Perhaps a childhood friends-type situation? The newly-crowned heir turns to an old friend for advice after years of not seeing them.  \n\n\n\\----  \n\n\nOnce again, those are all totally optional---just things to get ideas rolling! If you're interested, I'd love to hear back from y'all!",

            "selftext": "Hey! Fresh off a break up and needing a distraction... \n\nI'm looking for romance. Let's write something original or cliche? I do both. \n\nIdea one: The rain was pouring. You just received word from your father that you were to marry the princess of an enemy kingdom. She had been described as strange and odd. She never wore dresses and she declined every other proposal except your future kingdoms. She arrives to meet you a week before the wedding and you already hate her. She's mysterious. A mask covering her face, her hair in a bun. She was wearing brown leather pants with a men's cotton top. She wasn't ladylike or so it seemed. Why would anyone want to marry a woman who carries a bow and a sword? \n\nAs the days go by, you are disgraced until she makes a painting (or) fixes your mother's garden (or) bonds with you over a death in either ones family.\n\nAnd the day of the wedding is the icing on the cake. You find out she's got powers when she saves you on the wedding night. You hate her again yet you're falling for her.\n\nIt's not fully fleshed out because I kinda wanna be open to ideas!\n\nIdea two: Cow boy city girl OR vice versa. I already have two starters. I just wanna see if anyone's interested before I throw them at you. \n\n\nBut I'm open to your ideas too!!\n\nYou can look at my previous plots to see what I've done and what I'm willing to do. \n\nI'm the Queen of Creepy so throw some horror movie sh*t at me! Or do a stalker and victim rp because every time I do one I get more and more excited. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 I dunno why. Don't ask. \n\n~Birdie Out~",

            "selftext": "\"Alright, I'm sure you've heard this enough. But let's do it one last time. My name is Isabella Sandoval. I was bitten by a radioactive spider and for five years, I've been the only Spiderwoman. But it wasn't always like that. The Spiderman of my universe isn't a hero, or even an antihero. He's the most dangerous supervillain in all of New York. I had to discover my powers on my own, and they're nothing like the usual ones. Well, that's not exactly true. I can climb walls and have the spider sense, sure, but there's more. I also have an active camouflage ability, and blades that come out from under my wrists. Maybe that last part isn't exactly a power, but it certainly helps. \n\n\"Moving on, you're probably wondering why I'm telling you this. Well, it's simple. I kill spider people. When I mastered my powers in my universe, I used them against our Spiderman, but it wasn't easy. Our fight destroyed several city blocks, hundreds of casualties. But I didn't even get a moment to relax. As I was catching my breath, something weird happened. I was taken from my rooftop, thrown through...something, and came out into an electronic billboard. I don't know where I am now, but something tells me it was for a reason. Could there be someone else like me here?\"\n\n*I know that's really short, but I watched Into the Spiderverse again today and decided to try using my Spiderwoman again. I can answer any questions you have in private, but first just a few tips to increase your chances with me.*\n\n*Don't use the chat system.*\n\n*Put effort into your initial message, make me want to roleplay with you.*\n\n*Have questions ready when you message me.*",

            "selftext": "Hey there, ya'll! The name's PK, I'm a 27 year old dude looking for (a) potential roleplay partner(s). Specifically, I'm looking for a fandom roleplay this time around because that's just what I'm in the mood for lately - sorry people who enjoy original universes. Maybe another day!\n\nI'll go ahead and (try to) keep this short and sweet. These are what I'm looking for, along with some brief summaries, and you can find more info about me - and what I'm looking for in general - down below!\n\n**Bleach:** (Post-manga AU.) - It's been X-amount of years since the Thousand Year Blood War and the following conflicts, and the Soul Society has once again found a sense of stability. However, recently, an alarming number of Hollow attacks are being reported. The strangest detail is that the attacks are said to have been performed by groups of Hollows rather than just one. And worst of all, there was a Menos presence reported in the last attack. Some within the Gotei 13 fear this is the work of the Arrancar Corps, a group of Hollows and Arrancar in Hueco Mundo under Tier Harribel's command who act as the only form of government, but this is impossible with the neutrality agreement between the two groups... isn't it?\n\nLargely intended to be a Shinigami and Arrancar character-centric plot, but I have a couple of ideas for other groups (Quincies, Fullbringers) if you're interested in playing them!\n\n**Soul Eater:** (Post-manga.) - 15 years after the peace brought between Witches and Shibusen in the aftermath of the Kishin Incident, the struggle between Meisters and Witches is pretty much just a memory. However, not everyone is happy about the unification; some magic users are appalled that years of struggle and tradition have been thrown away and some Meisters hate the fact that Death Scythes have been abolished. So, there are certain groups that stir up trouble. There are people who illegally hunt Witches, magic users who still declare hostility against Shibusen and then there are are still remnants who worship the Kishin and wish to see him free from the Moon. Terrorists, one and all, their actions have largely worked only to strengthen the peace by giving those who uphold it a common enemy. However, the most dangerous persons have yet to act...\n\n**Kill la Kill:** (Alternate Universe.) - Honnoji Academy, and the city surrounding it, is under attack. A rash of assaults have been occurring throughout the city as students are stripped of their Life Fiber clothing. So far, attempts at thwarting these attacks have been met with failure - unable to prevent it at best, the people meant to stop them being stripped of their own Life Fiber, too, at worst - and what was once thought to be a mild inconvenience is becoming a much more serious threat. So a task force is being put together: one dedicated to hunting down the culprits and bringing them Honnoji-bred justice!\n\n**Digimon:** (Darker and more mature themes than the source material.) - A slew of grisly murders has put the city into a state of emergency. People, particularly youths, have been found horrifically slaughtered over the past few months. The government refuses to comment on their investigation and there seems to be no culprit in sight. The strict instructions the people must follow do not seem to be helping, which has led to riots and rebellion. People are angry and people are still dying. Between the murders and the riots, tensions are high, and an unlikely set of heroes will be chosen to solve the mystery.\n\nAnd the non-anime idea!\n\n**Resident Evil:** Literally just an AU Raccoon City-era roleplay. My idea is an attempt to combine the various forms of media (particularly 2 and 3) into a combined, comprehensive plot. The more you know about the RE universe (especially pre-4 games), the better off you'll be if you're interested in this idea. This roleplay is also probably the one exception to my \"OCs first and foremost\" rule.\n\nThese are not the only ideas I have, they're just some of the most fleshed out ones and one I'm **really** in the mood for lately. You're free to ask about my others one, if you'd like, and if **you** have any ideas, you're free to run them by me but I can't promise I'll be interested or knowledgeable about what you're asking for.\n\nHere's that other info I mentioned:\n\n* Be 18 or older. Sorry youngin's, but I'm not interested in roleplaying with anyone younger than 18. It's not for any NSFW-related reasons, I just feel more comfortable roleplaying with people over 18. I do better with people closer to my age, but I won't be too picky as long as you're an adult.\n* This might be a dealbreaker for people, but I'm an OC kind of guy. I have a number of (I like to think) well crafted, fleshed out Original Characters that I very much enjoy and intend on using. I **can** double and play canon characters on the side, but I don't like playing them and only them or having them as my primary character. I totally get roleplaying for wish fulfillment fantasies, but that's not really what I'm here for. You, on the other hand, are free to use a canon character if you'd like, though it really depends on the individual roleplay itself. I do, however, encourage the use of OCs regardless - good OCs, that. If your character is an ultra badass OP Sue that has every power and is the best at everything, I'm probably not interested in roleplaying with them.\n* I am bi, but most of my characters are not. So, if you're interested in romance, you should know that I primarily play male characters who are straight, much more interested in women or are aro/ace altogether. I do have and play non-straight and female characters too, they're just typically not my mains. So, if you're looking for gay romance first and foremost, you can run it by me, but I don't promise I'll be interested.\n* This post is made with one-on-one in mind.\n* I'm looking for paragraph-style, third-person responses. If you can't do that, I'm sorry, but I'm probably not interested in doing this roleplay with you.\n* Length and descriptions can fluctuate. I'm not expecting you to summon your inner Stephen King and crank out a novel every time you write to me, and honestly I probably won't be able to do the same for you. As long as you put some degree of effort into your posts, I'm okay with that.\n* If you're **really** interested in this, I'd suggest sending me more than just a generic \"hey, I saw your post and I'm interested!\" message. I honestly tend to ignore those kinds of messages. Tell me a little bit about yourself and your interests, like how much you enjoyed any of the series I mentioned! Or other series that you've enjoyed over the years! Or your roleplaying experiences! You don't have to tell me your entire life story, but anything besides just a simple \"hello, I'm interested\" is much appreciated and will most likely go a lot further.\n* If you've actually read all of this, please put \"Dilly Dally\" as your message subject. It'll help me sort out the people who read this from the people who didn't!\n* I'm not looking for *just* a roleplay partner, I would like to be friends too! I think a roleplay is much more interesting when you interact with and befriend the person(s) you're playing with. It especially helps when it comes to activity and world building. If you want to keep our relationship professional though, that's fine too.\n* I absolutely do not expect multiple responses a day, or even a single response a day, because I can't even promise that myself. Sometimes you hit weird moods or life gets in the way and that's fine! However, I would prefer that we let each other know if we aren't going to reply for a while or if we're having a hard time coming up with a response.\n* Be okay with swearing, gore and other mature themes. Things will get gritty and dark (probably more than you'd expect) sometimes and I am expecting you to be okay with that.\n* On that note, however, I'm not really interested in, or intending for, anything NSFW happening. If you are, you're free to ask about it, but I guarantee nothing.\n* I'm an old-school forum roleplayer so that's the platform I'm used to ~~i'm so old rip~~. That being said, Discord is obviously the most convenient way to roleplay these days and my posts often break the character limit and require multiple messages as a result. I'm also open to roleplaying through e-mail, on forums (if those are still a thing lmao) or even on here in the DMs!",

I'm really tired of the ghosting, lack of communication etc and I'm currently strictly looking for the type of roleplayers that enjoy writing one plot after another with a couple of people rather than switching rp partners every 72 hours ;p If that's not your cup of tea, then please don't read any further or reach out because we're not going to be a good match.\n\nNow that that's out of the way... My name is Liam, I'm 21 years old and I'm currently enjoying my summer holiday (though I'll be active as well when college starts again of course!). I love writing and I'm currently writing a book, though next to that I really enjoy roleplaying. I write M/M and M/F romances next to the genres slice of life, drama and angst. (I won't reply to people asking me to write different genres.)\n\nHere's what I'm looking for writing-wise:\n\n\\- I like writing actively. Now I know not everyone has the time to shoot a couple replies a day, some days I can't either, but I do expect at least 1 reply every 2 days. If you get busy, just let me know and it won't be a dealbreaker as long as it doesn't happen over and over again.\n\n\\- Real life face claims only.\n\n\\- At least up to 10 sentences per reply. The longer the better.\n\n\\- 3rd person. No text talk. Proper English.\n\n\\- You must be 18+ in real life.\n\n\\- My characters don't top in m/m ships. This doesn't mean that they can't take control, but they do prefer to take it... You know what I mean. I'm looking for manly, confident characters. Feminine, extremely shy, you name it doesn't interest me to roleplay as or with.\n\n**- If you're someone who can't be honest when they don't like someone and would rather ghost than talk about it, don't add me. I, myself, will tell you when I don't like an idea or something that's going. I expect my writing partners to do the same as well. This way, we can find a solution rather than either of us feeling like we've wasted our time on each other.**\n\n\\- It's a plus if you enjoy talking outside of the roleplay as well as constantly coming up with ideas and shipping our characters : )\n\nIf you're interested in writing, please shoot me an introduction here. If I think we're a good match I'll either add you on discord if you've added yours or shoot you my own : )\n\nHappy writing! : D",

I love the Fire Emblem series, I've played all the 3ds games, heroes, and some of the older games. I'm looking to do an rp based around either Awakening, Fates, or Three houses. I'll be playing as either a male or female Robin, Corrin, or Byleth. You can play any of your favorite character or characters for either a regular rp, or an rp with some smut involved. I have a few ideas for scenarios, but let's discuss that in DM's. Some of my favorite characters are Panne, Cordelia, Hinoka, Rinkah, Leonie, Manuela, and Edelgard. If you're interested please message me with what character or characters you want to play as and possibly a scenario you would rather play. Thank you and have a good day.",

Our characters keep meeting at big conventions and end up bonding over shared interests.

I have a whole list of vague ideas for this that I would love to share. \n\n\\-Modern Fantasy. Give me witches and those with powers and werewolves and vampires.

It also takes from various pop cultures references in one big thing, basically a 'fandom' sort of thing (But no exactly). So I\u2019m saying this now, the RP is not entirely an *original idea*, but I\u2019d like to just have fun from hosting more serious ones.\n* **\\[Lore\\]:** Bedlam Badlands is a post-apocalyptic RP that takes sources from many names in the genre, mostly *Skyshines Bedlam*, *Mad Max, Borderlands, Into The Badlands*, and possible few others into a chaotic and gritty world full of Psychopaths, Mutants, Marauders, and other ilk. Now hold on, just because it takes reference from these doesn\u2019t mean the story will be all the same. You can do anything you want in Bedlam, being a marauder scouring the hot desert wastes for loot, a mutant living the dangerous yet luscious mutant forests, even a A.I being free of making its own choices. However the main antagonist of this RP is the one and only, King Eviscera, the monstrous giant of a man that took control of all of Bedlam. It\u2019s up to you whether or not you\u2019d like try to defeat him, loot the wastes, or meet its various inhabitants and clans while doing various side quests. There\u2019s even a cyberpunk portion to the Rp, where you can live in the city of Byzantine, \u2018the last modern city in the world\u2019. You can work with the various illegal underground groups, be a police officer and attempt to stop them, and even more to come.\n* **\\[Rules/Info\\]:** There\u2019s no dice roll system, it\u2019s free form but I will remind you I won\u2019t allow Meta/Godmod actions, and will leave certain RP arguments between players up to a dice roll or Staff intervention. You can make up to 5 various characters, and explore wherever and whenever. I am owner and main host, and I have only 1 Staff member. If you\u2019d like to help, I\u2019d appreciate it by giving me a DM and seeing if I'll accept. Sorry if this all seemed short and weak, but I just wanted to be able to RP in peace without worry or breaking my back for it like my other attempts. Any information needed can be asked upon joining, so I hope to see you here soon! *- Outlaw*  \n\n* **\\[Invite\\]:** [https://discord.gg/6BfkRd8](https://discord.gg/6BfkRd8)",

I usually write in first person past tense (I looked at her, she looked at me, etc) but I can give third person a go if you're staunchly anti-first-person.\n\nI consider myself 'literate', and can write several paragraphs per post or reply or whatever. Though length does vary, I prefer to keep things at 3-5 per pop, so events can keep moving swiftly, and we don't get bogged down in unnecessary filler details that do nothing whatsoever to drive the plot along. Sometimes I might write a shorter amount, depending on energy levels or whatever, but I'm usually pretty consistent.\n\nI'm willing to give most genres a go, but I prefer slice of life stuff, modern day fantasy, medieval fantasy, Victorian fantasy, science fiction (see a pattern here?), pretty much any kind of fantasy. Low or high doesn't matter, but I prefer things to be in some way not the norm at all, even if it might seem normal for the characters.\n\nSpeaking of, I prefer to play my own gender, but I can play female if it's necessary to the plot; if I do play female, I'd prefer us both to be playing that. I don't do mxm at all. I prefer to focus on two characters, bringing in others when needed, but I'm open to other alternative ideas too.\n\nI prefer the slow-burn romantic kinds of plots, with lots of character development, gratuitous adorableness, and lashings of angst and emotional turmoil. I'm not a huge fan of gore for gore's sake, but if it makes sense in context, I'm all for it.\n\nI have a few ideas floating round, and some more in my head that haven't yet been written anywhere. At the moment, I've got a few everyday ideas, a couple or three involving people with superpowers, a couple of Fantasy things, and some miscellaneous stuff, too.\n\nI'm around most of the time, and can reply pretty regularly, and will often match whatever I'm given in terms of quality, length, etc.\n\nI prefer to use Discord or something similar, but if you're only able - or willing- to use Reddit PMs or emails, then I can work with that too. Please don't send me messages on Reddit chat- I don't use it, and I will totally miss your messages.\n\nI look forward to hearing from whomsoever this might interest!",

All my ideas are over the top, pastel and neon color blazing, starry eyed spacenauts and rapid fire laser light show in the furthest edges of the unbelievable universe. I want big babes and out of place, but so acceptably native cowboys in the plateus of the solar system. Shiny robots that shoot a billion missiles and call it warming up. Cars with rubber wheels racing against rocket ships to win the empire of the galaxy. I don't want clean world building. I want stuff that doesnt make sense to anyone but our characters and everything is the end all be all event of the universe.\n\nI play characters that are usually older. Usually washed up, used to be the best there ever was kind of guys. Cowboys who got near deathed off the scene. I legit have ideas where there is a race in cars across planets to decide the emperor of the galaxy. A Redline inspired ridiculous action romance adventure of nonsensicle physics, big explosions, and relationships that should have never have happened.\n\nIf this is your bread and butter hmu and we can exchange contact info.

As for a partner I'm looking for, simply being able to write in third person and able to write at least a paragraph. Now I high recommend being able to play more than one character for this since it would help just in general and with the large amount of characters in the Touhou universe.\n\nIf you're interested or have any questions, just message me and I will send you my discord stuff.",

            "selftext": "On the hunt for new roleplaying partners for something ideally based within a Star Wars setting. To give you a little bit of context:\n\nI am a third-person, paragraph-style roleplayer although I am not a stickler for post length - substance is important to me. Most of my posts will probably be about a paragraph, more if there's a lot happening and I'm setting a scene or such.\n\nAs for what I'm looking for in a partner, I would appreciate decent activity but real life always comes first. Grammar is important but as long as it's tolerable I'm not tough on it as long as a decent attempt is made. I am definitely okay with chatting on the side. I would like the atmosphere to be laid back and fun, rather than cold, overly serious and disinterested. My partner should also be 18 or above.\n\nI am looking to exchange discords and use the same platform to write. I generally prefer more rapid-fire posting, but I understand scheduling and just being plain busy or not feeling like it.\n\nIn terms of the nitty gritty details of the roleplay: I am more interested in Legends than nu-canon, but I can work with a healthy mix. I am primarily interested in the era just after Return of the Jedi, but I'd also be interested in the Galactic Civil War / Original Trilogy as a whole, or perhaps Clone Wars as a setting. I like a slightly darker and grittier tint myself, but I'm flexible in that department. I'd like us both to drive and shape the story, but I may have some ideas in mind and am comfortable playing my share of side characters if there should be a need.\n\nI should also specify that I am mostly looking for original characters here, especially ones that are well balanced and make sense. I will not be playing a force sensitive myself, and if you choose to play one I would prefer they stay in the post-ROTJ period or the Clone Wars, but will hear you out if your ideas differ. I often envision my character as a mercenary / bounty hunter, but there is some flexibility and room for him to end up in a lot of different arrangements. For example, I could place him into the Rebel Alliance during the GCW or the Republic perhaps in the Clone Wars without too much trouble.\n\nThemes in the roleplay can vary depending on what we want to include, definitely a topic for further discussion. My timezone is the East Coast of the US, though my schedule is random and varied on occasion. I am certainly open to romance as long as the characters are compatible (MxF pairings) and it occurs naturally. NSFW is a possibility, but not a requirement.\n\nLet me know if you're interested or have any further questions!",

I am looking for someone who won't ghost or disappear without telling anything because I had that too many times. I expect at least a paragraph as a reply and not just a sentence.\n\n\nAs for the plot, I have an idea in my mind and I do have my character (Also a ref). I'll let you create your own character and we will see where we can take the rp after we discuss and share our characters. I want you to create your own character because It makes is more interesting and unexpected than if I choose your role. I am both okay with you playing both Female and Male character. Also, you should be willing to rp as NPC's as well (so will I)\n\nThe Rp I want to try:\n\u2022 High School Roleplay\n\n\nThanks for reading and I hope you are interested in roleplaying together, please write your fav colour at the title of your message so I'll know you read it all the way through the text and not just spamming.\n\nBye~",

Most of my time I've been role-playing on Kik but now I'm using Discord too. I roleplay both genders and don't mind playing more than one character. \n\nPlots i had on my mind - \n\n1. Military Boyfriend coming back home \n2. Age Gap Love \n3. Teacher x Student \n4. Rich girl dating a poor guy \n5. Youtuber Couple \n\nWhat is important to me is you to like romance, slice of life or drama relationships between a couple of maybe even families. If you want to roleplay just know that I have a list of plots but also you can come up with yours. I do play only in third person. \n\nThank you all for reading this. Anyone who wants to roleplay just hit me up here or in Pms to get my kik or Discord username. Thank you again! Hope to hear from you all soon!",
