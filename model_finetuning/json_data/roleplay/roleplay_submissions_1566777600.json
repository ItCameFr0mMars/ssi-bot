They rarely communicate. They rarely leave the walls that stand between them and what they don't know. There are echoes of what they once were- plunging mines filled with machinery, shambling giants that were homes. They avoid these memories too, frightened and unable to recall what time and disaster stole.\n\nThey avoid anywhere that there might be darkness. When night falls, the creatures that live in the shadows have full rain. They inhabit dessicated bodies that were once people and things that aren't human at all. Tall and faceless, strong and vicious. \n\nNo one wants to be caught outside of the walls when night comes. No one dares do anything that might have them thrown from the safety of numbers. And those that are? All they can do is pray they survive long to build walls of their own.",

            "selftext": "Hello! Long time lurker, first time poster, so let's get right into it. Our characters are generals from opposite sides of a war that's been going on for a long, long time. For whatever reason, be it that they both rose through the ranks at a similar rate, coincidence, a held grudge, or something else, the two of them could never seem to avoid each other in a fight. They also happened to be too evenly matched to do much more than scar each other up. Enter some other third force, which is so powerful that neither side could hope to fight it off on their own. In a last-ditch effort to drive it off, the two sides form an uneasy alliance with the understanding that once the threat is gone, they'll go right back to fighting. Somewhere along the way, likely after months of distrust and a lot of awkward silences, our characters figure out that when they aren't trying to kill each other, they actually get along like a house on fire. Oops.\n\nIf the above sounds vague, that's because it's supposed to. I'm looking for someone down to flesh out the details together. My initial thoughts on setting were something medieval (fantasy elements optional), but I could be persuaded into something else easily enough. I'm also primarily looking for male characters for this one, but I'll take a female or nonbinary character if they're compelling enough.\n\nI'm looking mostly for someone 21+ (I'm 25) and won't take anyone under 18. I'm in the EST timezone and work typical full time hours, so I'm mostly around on evenings and weekends. I can tap out a small novel's worth of background/setting/internal thoughts/dialogue/what have you, but I don't find that it's necessary for every single scene. Quality over quantity is the name of the game. That said, I'm also not looking for someone who works exclusively with one paragraph or less. I'm not going to flay you over a typo or a misplaced comma, but I'm looking for someone with a good grasp on grammar and spelling. I'll definitely be playing some side characters and I'd like if my partner did, too. My left leg for someone who would be willing to flesh out a cast of characters and maybe jump around and do scenes without our mains sometimes.\n\nSo yeah, those are the basics. Feel free to slide on into my DMs with your thoughts/questions/etc.",

Moving here will only guarantee your success in the future.  \n\nCrime rates are thankfully low - well, at least that\u2019s what everyone (including the police) believes.   \n\nAlongside wide-eyed teenagers looking to make it in the big city also lay the Mafia. Three separate families all at each other\u2019s throats, keen to see their rival\u2019s downfalls. Only one family can come out on top of the others at one time - so who will it be? That\u2019s down to you.  \n\n\u2026 Hold on. How are these families even maintaining influence, anyway?  \n\nCaf\u00e9s.  \n\nYes, seriously. Running caf\u00e9s.  \n\nGone are the days where Mafia members would roam the streets, selling drugs in order to earn recognition from their higher-ups. Gone are the days where there would be family wars involving guns, knives, and any other weapon they could get their hands on.  \n\n\u2026 Family wars now involved lattes and cupcakes. The guns and knives are still there, of course, just on the down-low. The police suspect nothing, because why would they? All they see are three renown caf\u00e9s, gaining money at a remarkable speed.  \n\nSure, it\u2019s an unorthodox way of doing things, but the benefits of running a caf\u00e9 instead of roaming the streets are remarkable. All trades and wars are carried out behind the scenes. Money is generated, legally, through the food and drink. Members of the Mafia are awarded with a great deal of protection, since no one suspects them now that they\u2019re all baristas, entertainers and waiters.  \nThe only thing all three caf\u00e9s have to worry about are the ratings. Critics hold the power to end their business with one fell swoop - and what Mafia would want that? Each family is to do everything in their power to keep their establishments alive - and yes, that does mean appeasing those that leave reviews. \n\n So, which caf\u00e9 will you choose? Or, if serving the Mafia disinterests you and the route of justice calls to you instead, why not try out the police? They\u2019ll certainly have some openings.  \n\n\n[https://discord.gg/p9Ag5aS](https://discord.gg/p9Ag5aS)",

I'm mostly looking for someone who would be interested in creating stories with me through RP in the themes of Medieval/Fantasy. As the title suggests, I'm also open Modern life themes as well as others (always open to suggestions).  \n\n\nIn terms of preferences: I usually RP as male characters, I often write in third person, and my post-length varies and it is usually around 2 paragraphs. Like I've said, the length itself varies depending on what you give to me to reply with.   \n\n\nI'm quite flexible, I post frequently, and my platform of choice is discord. If life itself does alter my frequency, I'll let the other side know. If you are interested, please do feel free to send me a PM here so we get to know each other better and plan it carefully!

I don't know if I'm the best leader but I try my best, and it's been open for at least five or six months. Also we use dice to try to keep everything balanced\n\nPlease note that if you don't want one of the characters on this list but are still interested in joining the rp that's fine, just ask and I'll give you the link. Also it's important to know that you don't just get a character you asked for you have to try out and prove you can play the character well, but we aren't too much sticklers on that\n\nNeeded Characters:\nDrax\nThor\nLoki\nMr. Fantastic\nInvisible Woman\nThe Thing\nBlack Widow\nScarlet Witch\n\nAlmost any X-Men or associated characters (including Wolverine)",

My name is Ducky, and this happens to be the first post I've ever done on this subreddit, so I'll attempt to make it as best I can!\n\nSo, to begin with, I am currently a college student, which can change up my schedule and cause a fair bit of havoc on my side. Also, I happen to live in Louisiana, which means I'm in either the American Central Timezone or I'm in GMT-6. As of writing this, it happens to be 12 o'clock, and I usually stay up till 2 AM, seeing as I have lunch classes.\n\nI have very few requirements for you as a roleplayer - since I'm based in Discord and am usually on my computer, I try to keep to a paragraph minimum for a reply. I would like for you to strive for this length, and honestly, the longer the better in my opinion. And seeing as how I'm an English major, I enjoy literacy.\n\n1) Dungeons and Deviants! Yes, this cyoa makes an appearance on my list. I enjoy the worldbuilding aspect of it, and I love how interesting the worlds themselves can get! I enjoy it when I'm able to both provide and enjoy an interesting roleplay. The roleplay is based around a point system and is set in a fantasy universe of magic and mystery!\n\n2) Space Suits! Another roleplay makes the scene. This one is based around another point system in a sci-fi universe, ruled by technology. This one allows us to either make our own world from scratch or to invade another world, such as Star Wars, Alien, or others like this!\n\n3) Slice of Life! I enjoy a good romance story, and especially those interlaced with both fluff and smut! It gives a creative aspect to the roleplay, and allows us to enjoy a simple romance without as many outlying factors as others may have.\n\n4) Your own idea! Oh yes, I love hearing new ideas that others may have! I love seeing interesting ideas and I love to simply talk with any partners I may have! So this allows YOU to be the creative one and impress me!\n\nI hope to talk to all of you soon! And I hope my posts become better as time goes on!",

Let's just say I never truly left the play stage of child development and it just turned into one of my favorite day to day hobbies.\n\nI am looking for a 1x1 partner preferably closer to my age. Older is fine I'm just not comfortable role-playing with 18 year olds. Please be able to use proper grammar and type more than five words for a response. I don't have a length style as it depends on the scene for me. I can write one sentence or a whole paragraph depending on what is called for. Oh, I'll also play male characters!\n\nIn terms of genre, I like everything from slice of life laced with drama all the way to sci-fi and magic. I do prefer a romantic element to all of them. My history of role-playing consists of magical worlds, celebrity assistants, medieval, wolf shape-shifting (God that was so long ago), and many more.\n\nHere are my current ideas: a few specific a few broad.\n\n1. Kara Danvers (Supergirl) and Cat Grant. This one is very niche as you would have to be a fan of the show Supergirl and a SuperCat shipper. This is my current #1 search.\n2. Celebrity x Assistant (female only). This has been my go-to for a while and has become a favorite of mine. You or I would play a celebrity and the other would be the assistant. Over time they fall in love, keeping it a secret from the world and causing drama within the relationship.\n3. Street Urchin x Sorceress. This one I did once years ago and it never got very far but I loved the concept. The idea is that you would play a sorceress or some other type of magic user. You're known in town for being able to help people with your magic. I, a poor street urchin (dunno why I like that term just do) am your friend who gets caught up in a tangled mess with some dark magic users and need serious help.\n4. Knight (male or female) x Princess. Now, you don't need to play a girly princess if you don't want to. But the idea is that I'm a knight and your personal body guard/best friend. We both have feelings for one another but due to our roles, neither is willing to risk it. Eventually we can't stop ourselves and it turns into a whirlwind romance of desperation and hiding.\n\nI'm also open to any ideas you might want to try and think I would like. I roleplay on here but I prefer discord.\n\nHope to hear from you!",

Though I'd entertain anyone as long as they were an adult.\n\nNow that's out of the way, what I am looking for:\n\nI want to run a roleplay set in a near-future science fiction world. I'd be pulling themes from movies, books and TV but everything would be original.\n\nMy idea would comprise of a militaristic group of either mercenaries or proper military going up against a enemy or environmental threat. Details can be sorted out.\n\nThe supernatural aspect of this is that your character and mine are a bit more than the typical soldier, how that plays out is up to you. If its an experimental super soldier, or cyborg or something else. \n\nI want this roleplay to deal with adult themes. Violence, sexuality, Trauma, Loss, Drama. With this there has to be some sort of chemistry between us so I'd like to chat and get to know how each other RPs before getting into it. I'd like at least daily responses and I use Discord for at least chatting. I could be convinced to used docs for the RP, but that would most likely restrict me to one response a day.\n\nIf this sounds like something you would like to try, drop me a message!",

I'm looking for some fun partners! \n\nUpdate (8/1) - Really craving some Kylux or a Good Omens story!\n\n**Rules :**\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0Partners must be 18+, I'm 21 so no minors! Sorry!\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0Must be able to reply at least a few times each week. I don't need you to tell me your schedule or when you're going somewhere, but just need you to be able to commit to the movement of the story.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0Must be literate! I don't need every reply to have multiple paragraphs (not that I don't love it) but I do expect correct grammar and at least a few sentences.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0Must be nice! We don't have to be friends, but I am chatty soo...\n\n\ud83d\udcf7If we are going to be doing a Fandom story, please be upfront in telling me how complete your knowledge is of the subject. I like to be sort of detail oriented.\n\n**Guidelines :**\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0Off the bat, I don't play straight guys in romantic situations. The only time I will play a straight guy is if the character is fully needed, or romance isn't involved. Every time I try to play one, they turn into a jerk.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0Playing more than one character is fine. I will also double up if you want me to play a certain character, as long as I think I can play them.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0I love romance. I just do, I'm sappy like that. This being said, I don't like stories where they just automatically are in love. This has a few exceptions, but most likely won't happen unless the story idea is really good.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0I'm also interested in like family style stories, as far as non-romance goes.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0I like to add real life themes into my stories. This is one, because I like drama, and two, because perfect stories in perfect worlds are no fun.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0My only triggers are only triggers when portrayed incorrectly. These are mental health issues, invisible diseases, and suicide. I will call you out on these things and stop the story if they are misrepresented. This is because incorrect portrayal of these things is something I have to deal with on a daily basis. I call people out in real life too. Constantly.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0Speaking of the above point, I do get sick quite often. This is just more of a heads up.\n\n\n**Ships :**\n\n(My characters will be italicized.)\n\n(Asterix by stories I'm craving.)\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0Star Wars\n\n\\- *OC* x OC \\*\n\n\\- *OC* x Poe \\*\n\n\\- *OC* x Hux\n\n\\- *OC* x Kylo\n\n\\- *OC*\u00a0x Anakin\n\n\\-\u00a0*Hux* x Kylo\n\n\\- *Rey*\u00a0x Kylo\n\n\\- *Jyn* x Cassian \\*\n\n\\- *Finn* x Poe\n\n\\- *Padme* x Anakin\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0Star Trek\\*\n\n\\- *OC* x OC\n\n\\- *OC* x Jim\n\n\\- *OC* x Bones\n\n\\- *OC* x Scotty\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0Harry Potter\n\n\\- *OC* x OC\n\n\\- *OC* x Newt\n\n\\- Remus X *Sirius*\\*\n\n\\- *Queenie* X Jacob\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0Marvel\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\- *OC* x OC\n\n\\- *OC* x Hawkeye (Clint or Kate)\n\n\\- *Hawkeye (Kate)* x OC\n\n\\- *OC*\u00a0x Doctor Strange\n\n\\- *OC* x Bucky Barnes\n\n\\- *OC* x Charles Xavier\n\n\\- *OC* x Hank McCoy\n\n\\-\u00a0*Spider-Man* x Deadpool\n\n\\- *OC* x Daredevil (Comics)\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0DC\n\nMostly just looking for BatFam stories.\n\n*OC* x Jason Todd\n\n\ud83d\udcf7BBC\n\n\\-\u00a0 *OC* x Sherlock Holmes\n\n\\- *OC* x John Watson\n\n\\-\u00a0 *OC* x Mycroft Holmes\n\n\\-\u00a0 *OC* x 10th Doctor\n\n\\-\u00a0 *OC*\u00a0x 11th Doctor\n\n\\-\u00a0 *OC* x OC Doctor\n\n\ud83d\udcf7Others\n\n\\- *Roxas* x Axel (KH)\n\n\\- *OC*\u00a0x Spencer (Criminal Minds)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Story Ideas :**\n\n(None of my ideas are too formed, to allow us to make it our own.)\n\n\ud83d\udcf7General Ideas That I'm Always Into\n\n\\-Modern Day AUs\n\n\\-Non-Modern AUs\n\n\\-Anything Cute Really\n\n\\-Canon-Divergent Stories that have basis in a Canon event\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0Star Wars\n\n\\-Matchmaker B.B.8 \\*\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 A story where our good pal beebee-ate accidentally acts as a matchmaker.

            "selftext": "Hello hello! As the name suggests, Rainbow Falls is a RP discord server that was recently created under the following theme of Modern Life. In order to spice the plots up, we've added a slight spiritual elemental to it.\n\nThe RP itself is about a city that just so happens to have a deep connection with a spiritual realm. Animals live in it but humans are unable to see them. However, there are families with certain bloodlines that are capable of interacting with the spiritual animals, and befriending them. This is a very basic TLDR; If you are new and want to meet new people, join and interact with us! We would rather meet you there and explain it ourselves better!  \n**~~^(P.S. The owner and admin of this server is looking for M x M partner to help with developing plot. Please don't leave the poor man alone.)~~**  \n\n\n***The link to the discord server*** \\--&gt; [https://discord.gg/UwUuJum](https://discord.gg/UwUuJum)\n\n# Requirements:\n\n1.) Be 18+ years old  \n2.) Be literate **|*****We do not want one liners |***",

For those of you aren\u2019t familiar with it, *Vampire: The Masquerade* is a gothic-punk roleplaying game where players struggle as they attempt to juggle their myriad of incompatible values. Our roleplay need not be entirely based off of it\u2014we can do a bit of our own world building.\n\nI don\u2019t want to say I\u2019m picky with my partners, but I do have some requirements:\n\n* 18+ due to the possibility of NSFW\n* Romance is a must since I\u2019m sappy like that. Preferably a slow-burn.\n* Looking for people who enjoy doubling. Having multiple characters keeps things from getting stale.\n* Third person past tense, please.\n\nAs far as platforms go, Discord is my go-to. However, I don\u2019t mind trying other platforms for the right partner. If none of that has deterred you, go ahead and shoot me a message! Don\u2019t forget to tell me about yourself.",

I have a job, but other than that, all of my time is spent either rping or playing video games. I have a black cat named Goku. She's pretty rad. I also have two cool dogs named Kona and BJ. I think I'm hilarious. I love the horror genre and creepy stuff in general  My rp replies are usually anywhere from 2 to 4 paragraphs per character, though they can get longer depending on what I have to work with and how inspired I am. I try to reply as much as I can. Life happens though and sometimes I get sucked into my video games. I am willing to play both male and female characters. I love doubling too. Romance is great. I will play characters, but I like to have my ocs as well.  \n**\\~How to contact me\\~**  \n\n\nPM me, if you want to rp with me!

We're based in a quiet, remote North American town completely cut off from the rest of society. In this alternate universe, Vampires have managed to dwell and thrive in this relative peace - arriving and populating the majority of the town, pushing the human population down to around 50%. Here, you'll pick whether you live as a regular human, a hunter, or a vampire. It's 2019, after all, and people tend not to discriminate. But, despite the harmony, there are always people on both sides that are born with natural contempt for their opposites.

For example, battles, enemies, classes, perhaps leveling up and rolling and stats. But also story and character driven. \nSearching for a DM type writer and roleplayer to write with.\nI prefer to focus on one character myself but she exists in a full world of other characters (like npcs) and your character would be a main focus as well.

            "selftext": " Welcome to Witcher: New Dawn! Based upon the universe masterfully crafted by Andrzej Sapkowski and turned into equally beautiful games by CD Projekt Red, the world of this server is based upon their creations. Many things will be similar to the source material but others, as you will find out, will be entirely different. Explore a vast and rich world ripe with mature and visceral conflicts, grey morality, political clashing, and magic with your own character, molded to the universe to create something uniquely for you! Be wary, though, for danger lies within every corner of the Witcher world and here, it is no different. Ancient forces clash, monsters prowl the lands, political cabals control from the shadows, magic permeates the land and deathly diseases afflict its people.     \n\n\nIn New Dawn, you will start your journey by creating your own character, selecting from a variety of different races from humans to nonhumans to even supernatural ones such as vampires and werewolves! Employed within the Guild of Silver, your character can start off of a simple craftsman, a monster slayer, a mage, and more, embarking on whatever quest you deem worthy for yourself. Become the greatest warrior to have walked the Continent and the Isles or mold yourself into its most famous craftsman, should you so choose. The only true limitation is your effort and dedication.   \n\n\n[https://discord.gg/tDjDaja](https://discord.gg/tDjDaja)",

            "selftext": " \n\nHello! I thought it would be rather fun to try and do an rp where our characters are kind of stranded on this island together and slowly they fall in love with one another, though your characters past might complicate it, were you married? Are you from the North or the south?  Because right at that moment the outside world seems to be a mess, as it\u2019s 1862 and the civil war was still raging at this point. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested just shoot me a message replying to the below prompt with your character so I can get to know them a bit better. \n\nI look forward to hearing from you! \n\nI promise that my writing is better than this, I was in a bit of a hurry!\n\n\\--------------\n\nThe night was filled with the sound of thunder. Brief flashes of lightning lit up the house with brilliant bright white light. Thunder followed not too long after, shaking the house with it\u2019s low rumble and unsettled those inside seeking refuge from the raging storm outside. \n\nElanor stood silently at one of the windows and watched as the trees outside danced, their leaves fluttering in the strong winds. She was wrapped in a blanket which only further protected from the forces of nature outside of her house. The house was huge\u2026 much too big for a woman of Nells size, but now that everyone had died, she was the only person that volunteered to take care of the lighthouse. \n\nShe had managed to get up into the tower and looked out upon the sea, it occurred to her that anything could happen and she would be none the wiser to it. She shivered and turned her head for just a moment, but when she looked back\u2026 There was a boat. It wasn\u2019t big by any means and it didn\u2019t seem to notice that it was heading towards the rocky shore of the small off land island. \n\nElanor watched in horror as the boat ran right into a particularly large patch of rocks. It splintered into thousands of pieces and the angry sea took away most of everything. The small woman gripped the window ledge and soon let go to rush down to the beach to, no matter how dangerous it might be to do so. \n\nShe threw off her blanket and grabbed a thick raincoat as she flew down the spiral steps. Elanor stood silently at the top of the steep stairway down to the beach. The sea threw around fragments of the boat like toys, she\u2019d hated to think what it would have done to the people on the boat. After a few minutes out in the cold rain she went back into the lighthouse and wrote feverishly about the experience and retired to bed, where she tossed and turned like the waves against the shore. \n\nThe next morning was was one of exploration for the young lighthouse keeper, the light drizzle slid off Elanor raincoat as she navigated down the steps down to the beach. There were three bodies, one was most definitely gone before she reached him. The other was the same, laying with his pale face in the sand and then the last\u2026 Well they had gotten up far on the beach. Further than the other bodies and they laid on their back with their arms splayed out on the ground. Nell kneeled by you and put her ear to your chest. She listened and there was the faint sound of air being taken into your lungs, she was shocked, but didn\u2019t waste time in shaking you. \n\nThat was then. Now it was two weeks later and you had been in and out of consciousness for most of it. Nell had been taking care of you to the best of her ability, she fed you soup when you were somewhat awake and washed your clothes, she even took you to the bathroom when the time called. Today you woke up. You stood on shaky legs and fell to the floor. From below there were the sounds of shuffling, then feet on stairs and soon a young woman poked her head into the room. She looked kind enough, with large dark eyes and long eyelashes to go with her sharp features. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re awake! I thought\u2026\u201d She put her hand on her chest and walked fully in. Her voice was soft as velvet. She stooped down to help you up, \u201cDo you\u2026 Do you remember me?\"",

            "selftext": "*Never felt at home in reality, always hide behind avatars.*\n\nThe Oasis is much like its namesake, a digital safe zone in the middle of a world circling the drain. A future made desolate by economic ruin and fading resources is kept on life support by what Humanity has begun to cling to in an attempt to stay afloat for just a few more years, until something changes - *If* it changes.\n\nBut that's neither here nor there. The Oasis has been snatched up by a wave of hysteria. People the world over, and the hundreds of worlds in the Oasis, are all scrambling to find three keys to unlock the door to a fortune with more zeroes than a string of binary. Half a trillion dollars and ownership of the Oasis itself are up for grabs, but you've gotta know what to look for. Dubbed the \"Hunt for the Egg\", it has since petered off, but recently some no name hunter found the first key, and now everything is back to a fever pitch.\n\nOne titan of industry stands in the way. IOI - Innovative Online Industries - is hot on the heels of this first find, with resources only a world wide corporation could have, and their plans include advertising dense enough to provoke outright seizures during prolonged exposure. Needless to say, that's not good for your health in a world where every facet of life, from leisure to work and even marriages tend to happen and your bank account in game is more or less what you live off of. Can't hack it in the arena? Get killed and loose that hard earned coin stash? Have fun dumpster diving for ham scraps, you six piece chicken mcnobody.\n\nAll that remains to be asked is this: Will you hunt for the egg and lead the way to fixing what's become inherently broken? Or will you follow someone else's lead and hope for the best? The choice is yours, in whatever form you take.\n\n*Saving the world that's tough but let's give it a shot, 'till you tell me game over.*\n\n-----\n\nHello! If you've made it this far, thanks for reading! I'm looking for a partner willing to do a Ready Player One roleplay, and I'd like to experience both the plot of the movie or book, but more importantly, I'd like to explore the Oasis with someone.\n\nThat being said, it's not necessary to have seen the movie, or read the book, but what is necessary is to be willing to make things up as we go! Loosely, sort of. Given the sheer scale of easter eggs in both the book and movie, the limits are endless. It can be dark and gritty, or it could be a slice of life style tale. Maybe something action oriented or a dialogue driven bonding session that can lead to something deeper when the masks are off and the online handles are set aside.\n\nI love the book, the movie, the universe in general, but what I love most about them is the concept of it all. It's a wide open sea of possibilities that can go anywhere without any real constraints, and the freedom of it has kept my mind on it since I first read the book a few years back.\n\nThis is getting pretty long, so if you've stayed with me, thanks for making it here! A bit about me is I have nearly a decade of experience writing, and I can write both third and first person, and depending on what's going on almost always at least a paragraph, if not a handful of them. I also like to make friends with my partners, so if you're chatty, that's a bonus!\n\nNow, I do have one hard limit, and it's that you be over 18, just because I feel more comfortable given the potential of gore/violence/other stuff. That can all be discussed on a per person basis, though. I'm interested in both parties being happy with it, rather than one or the other.\n\nNow, time to close this all off. If you're interested, please send me a message and we'll see if we can make something work!",

I don\u2019t expect you to be a historian but some basic accuracy. \n\n-21+ ONLY. I\u2019m a sucker for romance with some messed up themes attached. Let\u2019s get weird?\n\n-Advanced lit. I\u2019m not expecting to write multiple page posts every time, but I enjoy being challenges and having a partner who matches me. \n\n-A Magic using character who makes sense in the setting of the intro post provided. (For the sake of the storyline, no magic is able to reverse the effects of vampire venom.) Other than that, go wild. \n\nI\u2019ve written an introductory post for my character. If you\u2019re interested, feel free to write something up and shoot it my way as both a sample and a starter. Honestly I\u2019m chill and just looking for a really interesting rp.

A new piece of 'art' could be visible from this place she was standing.\nThere was a woman, her body, to be precise. It was leaning against a thin railing, her alms\u00a0stuck\u00a0to her cheeks, mouth open in a soundless scream, horror in her widened eyes.\n\"Jack, just don't tell me it's...\"\n\"It is, Miranda, it is,\"\u00a0a man shook his head glumly, packing his case with tools.\u00a0\"Same marks. Her tooth removed,\u00a0\u00a0fingertips cut off. There is a carved triangle at her neck. We will do everything we can, but this beast hasn't left any evidences since their first kill. Just... nothing.\"\n\"But there must be something!\"\n\"There is a group of hikers, who found the body. Talk to them, they might hear or notice something strange\"\n\n***\n\"So, you have\u00a0nothin', huh?\"\u00a0the last failed witness was sitting in front of her. The first impression of the crime scene had been replaced with teenager's curiosity, so now she was at the document in the officer's hands, as if she could see through the cover and upside down.\nFour previous travelers had already been questioned, they knew nothing about the crime and noticed nothing suspicious. So the police had less than nothing. That was not that kind of information Miranda was eager to share.\n\"Thank you for your cooperation, miss Alison. You may be free now,\"\u00a0she notified, her voice cold and steady. Although the girl did not hurry to leave the room as she heard the permission.\n\"You know, if\u00a0there is no visible evidence doesn't mean there is no evidence at all.\"\n\"Beg your pardon?\"\n\"We stayed at a house two days ago. The girl who owned it was pretty weird. She said she was\u00a0kind of a... mage. She said she could talk to spirits or something. Since you don't have any alive\u00a0witnesses, you might talk to the dead ones...\"\nDear Lord. Miranda rolled her eyes in a soundless prayer, barely kept herself from a chuckle. Taking into account her emotional state the latter could easily turn into hysterical laugh, which would not be a sign of a\u00a0professional policeman.\nMediums, rituals, spirits of the dead. All those things seemed as believable as Santa Claus, riding his northern deer from chimney to chimney.\n\"Thanks one more time, miss Alison. If we need you or your\u00a0advice, we will let you know.\"\n\n...who could imagine, that she will stay at the medium's door a week later, desperate and completely drunk.\u00a0\"FBI. Open the door!\"\n\n\n____\nSo. I am looking for this medium, who will help to\u00a0\u00a0puzzle the case out. Why didn't she call the police when she found a drunk woman, kicking the door? Why did she let her in and offer her help? Could she\u00a0foresee\u00a0this visit and was she expecting her night guest?\u00a0Who\u00a0knows.\n\nP.S. slash is possible, Miranda can become\u00a0Randolf, that's not a big deal. The temper and the bio remains almost the same.\n\nMiranda is a\u00a030 year old\u00a0woman, who is obsessed with her job. She is divorced (her husband claimed that she loved those corpses and fingerprints more than her own family), has 4 year old\u00a0daughter, Megan.\u00a0Since\u00a0her complicated schedule, last time she saw her daughter was a half of a year ago.\nShe tends to spend most of her time at her study, working and drinking coffee. Though her cup is smelled of strong alcohol now. This case literally drives her crazy. It has to be solved.\n\nSome information:\n\u00b7 am 23 (I expect you to be 20+)\n\u00b7 write in 3rd person, past/present tense (it depends)\n\u00b7 250 words on average\n\u00b7 1 post in a day or two days\n\u00b7 GMT+3\n\u00b7 tend to use\u00a0Discord",

            "selftext": "Fifty years after Naruto Uzumaki, the Nanadaime Hokage, light of the Shinobi World, finally passed just days after his wife - Hinata Hyuga (1109). The tranquility that he had breathed into a young world took the form of the organization known as the Shinobi Union began to give way. Like all things it was victim of a cyclic decline. The future generations of Kage of the Great Shinobi Nations and their villages could no longer find the common ground necessary to govern themselves as a unit. During Sarada Uchiha's reign as Kyudaime Hokage the Union shattered into the five original pieces with countless splinters and shards. The political upheaval created a vacuum of conflict which bred the Fifth Great Ninja War.  Iwagakure is forced into a martial alliance with Kumogakure and Kirigakure before the two more aggressive villages lead a two pronged attack on the Land of Iron and the Sunagakure and Konohagakure alliances. The Land of Iron decimated the Shinobi and immediately sealed their borders to any and all outsiders.  With the brunt of the Kumo-Kiri-Iwa forces routed the Konoha/Suna alliance is allowed to breath and survive the war until a stalemate is formed. Unfortunately, Kirigakure is destroyed during this process and the Land of Water is thrown into an economic depression the likes of which have never been seen before.\n\nDuring this despair not all was lost. Even with Konohagakure crippled in strength the Uzumaki clan has began to flourish over the course of generations, as well as the Uchiha clan. Restarting strong in Konohagakure during Sarada Uchiha's reign as Hokage. The ire of the intermingled histories of the Uchiha with the origin of Konoha returned to the surface to some dissenting Uchiha and the group left the village for life abroad. Refusing to stay in such a place any long. Allowing for Uchiha of other villages to begin their origins. The Biju, tailed beasts, are free to roam the land. But have focused their activities in the area known as the Valley of the Biju. A place ornamented by the ruins of Uzu and the Tomb of Naruto.\n\nThe world is healing and the villages are once again open to cooperating - at least in theory.\nThe year is 1259 YC\n\nTL;DR: This Roleplay takes place 50 years after the Fourth Great Shinobi War. But instead of directing following in Boruto\u2019s story, this roleplay diverges paths after Naruto Shippuden. Though it may take influence and ideas from parts of Boruto. ALL USER MADE CHARACTERS ARE OCs!\n\n---\n\nYes! That is right! A NEW Naruto roleplay is here! here we pride ourselves on out basic stat mechanics and our laid back style. Here you will be a Hidden Leaf ninja and you'll make your way up to a powerful nin and create your own journey! Please join us at r/KonohagakureRP today and [MAKE A CHARACTER](https://www.reddit.com/r/KonohagakureRP/wiki/charctersheet)!\n\nWe are beginning our first Chunin Exams and while you may not enter these ones, we'll always have more opportunities for our players to advance. AND we are looking for players of any rank! We implore you to start as a Genin but if can wow us with a good backstory you may get a higher rank!",

            "selftext": "Hello! I\u2019ll try and make this as easy to digest as possible. \n\n\nFirst things first: Let\u2019s not take ourselves too seriously, okay? I\u2019m trying to have fun, write some weird stuff, and make new friends. I look forward to learning what you like, and how you write. If something isn\u2019t going right or one of us just isn\u2019t feeling it, communication is key. \n\nAbout me: I go by Sunday. I\u2019m 21+ and would love for you, my prospective partner, to be as well. I\u2019ve been roleplaying since the days of my youth on Neopets. I\u2019ve always loved writing as a hobby, and have sadly let it get away from me in the past few years. \n\nAbout my writing: I like to use weird words to describe things. I like short sentences, long sentences, peppering in swear words. I write short replies (3 paragraphs) and I write looooong replies (10+ paragraphs). Whatever the scene calls for. I write third person only. \n\nAbout my characters: I prefer to play a male character, but I will gladly play any gender. I am very flexible. I like to double, triple, throw in all the characters that the scene or story needs. Or keep it intimate with just two mains. Whatever, you know? Flexible. That\u2019s me. \n\nAbout our roleplay: It\u2019s what you want. Like I said, I want to know your craving. Think of me as your roleplay guinea pig. I\u2019m willing to try anything at least once. I have some likes and dislikes, but I haven\u2019t roleplayed in a while, and I\u2019m trying to not fall into the same tropes I used to write over and over. I want something fresh n\u2019 tasty. I want a challenge. I want something that is uncomfortable and rewarding. I want anything at all, at this point. Just hit me with your sweet, sweet ideas and delicious cravings and we will figure it all out. \n\n\nSome things to note: I am willing to venture into some darker territories, but I have a select few limits that I can share with you in private. Also, I have never done all the fancy face claim stuff that everyone seems jazzed on these days, but I\u2019m willing to give it a try. \n\nHistorically, I have roleplayed only over e-mail, but some kind folks have showed me the ropes of Discord, and I\u2019m kinda loving it over there. Ask me for my username, and let\u2019s be friends.\n\nAlso, I would love to entertain your group roleplay pitches. If you have a server or forum that you love, and that would welcome a clueless worm like me, I\u2019d love to talk to you. \n\nSlide into my DMs (PMs? What is it here?) to start the adventure. \n\n\nTL;DR\u2014 I want to talk to you about roleplaying, so talk to me. We\u2019ll figure it out, and hopefully we\u2019ll have a nice time writing together.",

The aliens instate themselves as royalty, like Kings and stuff, and high class, and the humans are the lower class and peasants. They create new countries and new borders, etc. For my idea, the humans decide that rather than continuing the war that's been going on for years (the rebellion or whatever) they want peace. The aliens would also prefer peace. So the humans and the aliens arrange a marriage between the king (basically the king of the whole race, rather than lower royalty such as lords and dukes who only rule a country as opposed to the species) and a human girl to show that they can be allies. Or something like that. You'd be the alien guy, you can create your own species/race/appearance and everything else, and I would be the human girl.",

Then, some people, once very responsible and outgoing, holed up in their homes and died from psychogenic death. Finally, headlines worthy of satire sites such as The Onion started cropping up in the daily paper. It seems that chaos itself has sunk its claws into your home.*   \n\n\n*But you, as a Stand user (or perhaps more than one) know better. You recognize that all this must be the work of one or more enemy stands. But why are they here? Are they just new user(s) with no idea of what they're doing? Or are they perhaps a warning for something much larger on the horizon?*  \n\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~  \n\n\nHey, everyone! I'm Ward and I have some characters of mine that I've recently adapted to the JJBA universe. SInce I started watching it, as a roleplayer I've had an itch to play the verse itself, so what better than to use the characters I already have? Here's the criteria for a partner for this RP:  \n\\- You can play up to four Canon or OC  characters on your end, or a mix of both.   \n\\-I am on MST, but I'm quite the night owl so it doesn't really matter.\n\n\\-This is taking place in a very large-scale Western city, such as New York. However, if you have a similar location in mind, real or fictional I'm willing to take it as a suggestion.  \n\\-You must be literate and try to respond fairly often, though I won't bother you about it unless it's been 24 hours. Don't bug me for replies constantly, please, as that immediately turns me off to the RP.   \n\\-Please at least be 16. I'm 19 so it feels awkward playing with people so young. \n\n\\-I'm fine with some OOC chatting, but it'll have to be kept in a different channel.  \n\\-It is up to you to decide where and how your character(s) start(s) with investigating these incidents. For example, they could be associated with the Speedwagon association, if they're not a canon character.   \n\\-Lastly, and most importantly, I;m only chipping my way through Stardust Crusaders at the moment, so NO SPOILERS OR CHARACTERS PAST STARDUST CRUSADERS. I'll let you know as I get to each new part, though.   \n\n\n  \nAnd that's it! hope to hear from some potential partners soon!",

            "selftext": "Hey there, ya'll! The name's PK, I'm a 27 year old dude looking for (a) potential roleplay partner(s). Specifically, I'm looking for a fandom roleplay this time around because that's just what I'm in the mood for lately - sorry people who enjoy original universes. Maybe another day!\n\nI'll go ahead and (try to) keep this short and sweet. These are what I'm looking for, along with some brief summaries, and you can find more info about me - and what I'm looking for in general - down below!\n\n**Bleach:** (Post-manga AU.) - It's been X-amount of years since the Thousand Year Blood War and the following conflicts, and the Soul Society has once again found a sense of stability. However, recently, an alarming number of Hollow attacks are being reported. The strangest detail is that the attacks are said to have been performed by groups of Hollows rather than just one. And worst of all, there was a Menos presence reported in the last attack. Some within the Gotei 13 fear this is the work of the Arrancar Corps, a group of Hollows and Arrancar in Hueco Mundo under Tier Harribel's command who act as the only form of government, but this is impossible with the neutrality agreement between the two groups... isn't it?\n\nLargely intended to be a Shinigami and Arrancar character-centric plot, but I have a couple of ideas for other groups (Quincies, Fullbringers) if you're interested in playing them!\n\n**Soul Eater:** (Post-manga.) - 15 years after the peace brought between Witches and Shibusen in the aftermath of the Kishin Incident, the struggle between Meisters and Witches is pretty much just a memory. However, not everyone is happy about the unification; some magic users are appalled that years of struggle and tradition have been thrown away and some Meisters hate the fact that Death Scythes have been abolished. So, there are certain groups that stir up trouble. There are people who illegally hunt Witches, magic users who still declare hostility against Shibusen and then there are are still remnants who worship the Kishin and wish to see him free from the Moon. Terrorists, one and all, their actions have largely worked only to strengthen the peace by giving those who uphold it a common enemy. However, the most dangerous persons have yet to act...\n\n**Kill la Kill:** (Alternate Universe.) - Honnoji Academy, and the city surrounding it, is under attack. A rash of assaults have been occurring throughout the city as students are stripped of their Life Fiber clothing. So far, attempts at thwarting these attacks have been met with failure - unable to prevent it at best, the people meant to stop them being stripped of their own Life Fiber, too, at worst - and what was once thought to be a mild inconvenience is becoming a much more serious threat. So a task force is being put together: one dedicated to hunting down the culprits and bringing them Honnoji-bred justice!\n\n**Digimon:** (Darker and more mature themes than the source material.) - A slew of grisly murders has put the city into a state of emergency. People, particularly youths, have been found horrifically slaughtered over the past few months. The government refuses to comment on their investigation and there seems to be no culprit in sight. The strict instructions the people must follow do not seem to be helping, which has led to riots and rebellion. People are angry and people are still dying. Between the murders and the riots, tensions are high, and an unlikely set of heroes will be chosen to solve the mystery.\n\nAnd the non-anime idea!\n\n**Resident Evil:** Literally just an AU Raccoon City-era roleplay, and possible with the idea of going further. My idea is an attempt to combine the various forms of media (particularly 2 and 3) into a combined, comprehensive plot. The more you know about the RE universe (especially pre-4 games), the better off you'll be if you're interested in this idea. This roleplay is also probably the one exception to my \"OCs first and foremost\" rule.\n\nThese are not the only ideas I have, they're just some of the most fleshed out ones and one I'm **really** in the mood for lately. You're free to ask about my others one, if you'd like! And if **you** have any ideas, you're free to run them by me but I can't promise I'll be interested or knowledgeable about what you're asking for.\n\nHere's that other info I mentioned:\n\n* Be 18 or older. Sorry youngin's, but I'm not interested in roleplaying with anyone younger than 18. It's not for any NSFW-related reasons, I just feel more comfortable roleplaying with people over 18. I do better with people closer to my age, but I won't be too picky as long as you're an adult.\n* This might be a dealbreaker for people, but I'm an OC kind of guy. I have a number of (I like to think) well crafted, fleshed out Original Characters that I very much enjoy and intend on using. I **can** double and play canon characters on the side, but I don't like playing them and only them or having them as my primary character. I totally get roleplaying for wish fulfillment fantasies, but that's not really what I'm here for. You, on the other hand, are free to use a canon character if you'd like, though it really depends on the individual roleplay itself. I do, however, encourage the use of OCs regardless - good OCs, that. If your character is an ultra badass OP Sue that has every power and is the best at everything, I'm probably not interested in roleplaying with them.\n* I am bi, but most of my characters are not. So, if you're interested in romance, you should know that I primarily play male characters who are straight, much more interested in women or are aro/ace altogether. I do have and play non-straight and female characters too, they're just typically not my mains. So, if you're looking for gay romance first and foremost, you can run it by me, but I don't promise I'll be interested.\n* This post is made with one-on-one in mind.\n* I'm looking for paragraph-style, third-person responses. If you can't do that, I'm sorry, but I'm probably not interested in doing this roleplay with you.\n* Length and descriptions can fluctuate. I'm not expecting you to summon your inner Stephen King and crank out a novel every time you write to me, and honestly I probably won't be able to do the same for you. As long as you put some degree of effort into your posts, I'm okay with that.\n* If you're **really** interested in this, I'd suggest sending me more than just a generic \"hey, I saw your post and I'm interested!\" message. I honestly tend to ignore those kinds of messages. Tell me a little bit about yourself and your interests, like how much you enjoyed any of the series I mentioned! Or other series that you've enjoyed over the years! Or your roleplaying experiences! You don't have to tell me your entire life story, but anything besides just a simple \"hello, I'm interested\" is much appreciated and will most likely go a lot further.\n* If you've actually read all of this, please put \"Dilly Dally\" as your message subject. It'll help me sort out the people who read this from the people who didn't!\n* I'm not looking for *just* a roleplay partner, I would like to be friends too! I think a roleplay is much more interesting when you interact with and befriend the person(s) you're playing with. It especially helps when it comes to activity and world building. If you want to keep our relationship professional though, that's fine too.\n* I absolutely do not expect multiple responses a day, or even a single response a day, because I can't even promise that myself. Sometimes you hit weird moods or life gets in the way and that's fine! However, I would prefer that we let each other know if we aren't going to reply for a while or if we're having a hard time coming up with a response.\n* Be okay with swearing, gore and other mature themes. Things will get gritty and dark (probably more than you'd expect) sometimes and I am expecting you to be okay with that.\n* On that note, however, I'm not really interested in, or intending for, anything NSFW happening. If you are, you're free to ask about it, but I guarantee nothing.\n* I'm an old-school forum roleplayer so that's the platform I'm used to ~~i'm so old rip~~. That being said, Discord is obviously the most convenient way to roleplay these days and my posts often break the character limit and require multiple messages as a result. I'm also open to roleplaying through e-mail, on forums (if those are still a thing lmao) or even on here in the DMs! I *may* be open to GoogleDocs, if you're willing to be patient with me and help me learn how to do it.",

            "selftext": "(Hello Roleplayers, I am looking for a detailed, dedicated and descriptive partner to help me delve into the Shadowrun universe. I have recently played the video games and got interested with exploring the lore further, hopefully making an interesting story based off the Seattle State centered around a new member of the Humanis Policlub and your character! Perhaps you are a rival or fellow member following a dark path with them, maybe you\u2019re an agent with Lone Star trying to give him direction and set him straight before he turns into a full blown terrorist, or maybe you\u2019re a Shadowrunner who got a job against the HP Chapter and found a potential source or an Anarchist who made a bad run in. I\u2019m hoping we can experiment if interested.)\n\nThe General Premise:\n\nLance Vogel grew up in the Renton area of the Seattle State, it was a dump, but it was his dump and it was home. A lower middle class neighborhood as a kid, Lance lived a relatively normal life with the occasional encounter with Meta-Humans and other shady individuals, though he never paid much mind to it. It wasn\u2019t until he was entering his teenage years that he and many other kids growing up in his neighborhood began to find themselves being introduced to hate and displacement. With crime going up and value within the community going down, soon they saw their neighborhood changing. Trolls, Orcs, Elves and other Meta-Humans slowly began to move in to the area and with it came all the problems of integration. Fights becoming frequent at his schools over pettiness, robberies and brawls causing people to stay indoors at night and an increasing divide as more Meta-Humans moved in lead Lance to start looking to other people for answers to his town becoming such Drek. The Humanis Policlub took advantage of the unstable conditions, offering Lance and many other kids from his town an answer to their questions and solutions to the crime, increasing poverty and anger. \n\nLance became more disconnected from his own family who grew concern with his growing hateful rhetoric, staying out later to meet his new \u201cfriends\u201d within the organization and being on the news after committing several unprovoked attacks against the Meta-Humans on their side of the neighborhood. This only worsened as the Humanis Policlub Chapter was secretly advocating for violence against the new coming Meta-Humans behind closed doors. Even offering them directions to gun shops and vendors who\u2019d offer them weapons if they revealed their affiliation. Now he is nearly a man, and he\u2019d soon be making decisions of whether or not he was ready to join the war against the Goblinized Menace.\n\n(If this sounds good enough and I didn\u2019t butcher any lore too much feel free to PM where you\u2019d like to roleplay.)",

I'm in a bit of a fantasy mood as of late,  and was hoping someone here could fill the craving.\n\nI'm  not to picky when it comes to plots/settings, and am even willing to  think of something with my partner. We can also use worlds already  created, provided I know of them. I'm a big fan of DnD, so you'll always  have me happy if we can base it off of that setting. (Although I  dislike using dice rolls for 1x1 RP's.)\n\nI'm  mainly looking to play women at the moment, since I play a lot of men  already. I'm more than willing  to make a character alongside your own. I don't mind NSFW elements (at  all) but do love it if there is a plot driving us forward.\n\nIf  you're willing to discuss something, or would like to talk on Discord.  Feel free to message me. I'd love to hear back from some of you.",

Im currently looking to so a long term superhero/vigilante roleplay the story will center around your character being recruited to join a team of heroes of various ages and backgrounds, and slowly becoming the greatest heroes the world has ever seen.\n\nIve done many roleplays in the past, hut this is one I'm particularly excited for, as i love superheroes/mythology. I love building a universe and building lore for for it, and i especially love stories about people rising up to do good in a world where people tell them that they cant.\n\nSo what can you expect from this roleplay? Action, drama, romance, and much more. As the GM I will he playing multiple characters, all of whom will be unique and interesting, and I'm not just talking about powers. Ill be taking lots of inspiration from other comics, and I will do my best to keep you hooked. \n\nThe stories will be divided into chapters, each chapter will focus on character development; characters will die, and others will be introduced, and the villains will test the heroes in ways you cant even imagine.\n\nIm purposefully being a little vague here... for more details, dm me! I can roleplay on discord or kik, and i look forward to hearing from you soon! If you text me please describe your characters powers and a short description of them fighting crime or saving someone.\n\nAlso! I stress this; I DON'T WANT PARAGRAPHS! 2-3 sentences per reply is fine, anything more is too much for me!",

            "selftext": "You had never known your mother. Dad often spoke of her though, that rare dreamy tone in his voice. A 'great and beautiful woman'. The \u2018Most intelligent person he had ever known\u2019 and \u2018as Kindhearted as a saint.\u2019 It was becoming difficult to continue believing that. She had to have been around for your birth of course, but as soon as you turned two she left you, as dad explains, and returned to her homeland far to the West. The Spirit Valley. Otherwise known as Elin Hal. Almost everyone who had known her in town proclaimed your likeness to her, a near identical physical resemblance, as if the coiling spirit-mark on your thigh wasn't enough. Dad had made her out to be some kind of incredible, all powerful witch who was needed by her clan, she had a great duty to fulfil and leaving the sleepy island you had spent your entire life on, leaving you, was a small sacrifice in the name of the greater good.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStill, it would be difficult not to resent her. A childhood that had been stripped away before you even knew it. Dad had attempted to raise you on his own. A doctor by trade, a pleasant man, well respected by loyal patients within town. But a doctor has a lot of work and, despite his best attempts, for the most part you were left to your own devices. There wasn't much to do on the island nation of Hanstrasia. It was populous enough not be a wasteland, busy enough so that one could work as any job they wished as long as they were qualified. But nothing seemed to happen. One would go through school, attend college, get a job, find a partner, get married... It was a simple stable uneventful existence. And that was how you always thought it would be.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUntil you received the letter. A request to meet, sent from your mother, who signed the brief document by the name Cecile Vengi. It was the first time you had experienced her actions directly. After much debate and encouragement from dad, who didn't seem to mind Cecile had changed her last name, you decided to rent passage on a merchant guild airship to the mainland and travel to the Spirit Valley, the famous, but distant, pilgrimage site. The homeland of witches.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs soon as you left your boring but safe island things started going wrong. The crew who maintained the airship proved to be lazy and uncooperative with you. The 'War of the Lions' between the great democratic Northern Federation and expansionist Southern Empire had spread to the east of the mainland and the fear of winding up in the hands of either nation had petrified the crew. To make matters even worse, you had just been boarded by pirates. Or at least, you thought you had. Rustling and shouting from up on deck and foreign, unfamiliar tongues echoed through the steel corridors of the airship. The vessel itself had slowed, merely floating sluggishly within the sky, a desperate attempt at escape seemingly halted. Out the port hole window you could see a smaller, streamlined black vessel, its float dust vents emitting an ominous violet haze. A triplet of winch harpoons preventing any hope of your merchant ship from breaking away, and even then, it would have been quite impossible to outrun the pirate hunter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLeft alone in the sky, nothing but the open ocean several thousand feet beneath you, the world seemed totally silent for a brief moment. Then the unmistakable sound of footsteps crept faintly from behind your cabin\u2019s door.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\--\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am looking for a partner to RP with on discord. The RP would revolve around the story of an 18 year old woman in a fantasy world on a journey to meet her mother for the first time. Along the way she would meet many interesting characters, discover much more about the world she inhabits, and solve the mysteries surrounding her mother. To a certain extent this is a coming of age story, with a young woman leaving her home for the first time, discovering what kind of person she is and what kind of person she might become.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis roleplay does not take place in a conventional fantasy setting. Technology is more akin to 1940/50s. There are no sentient species aside from Humans. People who can cast magic are not conventional 'wizards' from something like harry potter or DnD, as is the magic used in the world. What's more, the Roleplay will include dark topics and themes as the story progresses, so id like my partners to be over 18 for my own peace of mind.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI take a GM style of roleplaying, taking control of setting and most characters, providing a story which ultimately your character stars in. This allows you to experience the plot, meet new characters and learn about them as your own character does. It means I can continually surprise you with twists and offer fun clues as well as foreshadowing to ongoing mysteries. I will never speak for your character or describe their action. All that is on you. Its your character. I understand that this style is not for everyone, as there are some who enjoy plotting stories out beforehand, so no hard feelings if you aren\u2019t so keen. I would also ask that you write in past tense. I don't really have a preference on first person or third person, but we'll talk briefly about what you choose regardless. I will always write in third person.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am not a smut writer and am not interested in writing graphic smut scenes, but I am borderline insistent on including some kind of romance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI normally write two or three paragraphs a response and can ordinarily make one response a day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe shall discuss your character and how the roleplay is going to work over discord. If you have any questions please ask in the comments so others might be able to read them and see my answers. Please include a writing sample if you choose to message me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI eagerly await to hear from you.",

            "selftext": "\"Extra! Extra! A local boy loses life by drowning! Pathfinders claim to know more information about the whereabouts of El Dorado! Extra, extra!\" A newsboy yelled, waving the wad of papers.\u00a0\n\n\nShe leisurely paced across the wharf, which was forlorn in the cold waves. Under the grey sky, the water was dark and the wood that jutted out from the beach was closer to black than brown. Though, despite the sullen ambience, she looked out to the shore with excitement, eyes upon the ships under steam and sail. A smile graced her face before she turned.\u00a0\n\n\nBefore her, pale stone palaces and domed churches squashed against new edifices, it was the equivalent of a patchwork quilt\u2014architecture borrowed this and that from other eras while lifting grey high-rises in modern foundations. Smoke crowned the city, coughed up from engines and factories and veiled the labyrinthine streets. Citizens were astir and went busily about their day. \n\n\nWelcome to Erskine, an industrious city with the largest port of the Empire. At the moment, a rumored place had snagged collective attention across the realm: a gilded sanctuary, dubbed El Dorado, swells with riches and relish, perhaps even rivalling Heaven itself. And so the people of the Empire rushed to embark on perilous expeditions, including a very zealous patrician... \n\n\n\u2014\n\n\nSo, who is your character? A conqueror who strives to despoil this rumored El Dorado? A fugitive escaping from their crimes? A bored aristocrat seeking an adventure? Perhaps an eldritch entity looking to ensue chaos?\n\n\nAbove is a prompt for those interested in a Victorian fantasy/supernatural roleplay. That means varying races/creatures, magic, adventure, and worldbuilding. Historical accuracy is loose and free to artistic liberties. \n\n\nI always like politics, violence, and gray morality infused into it too. So this roleplay is not intended for the faint of heart. With that being said, contribute to the plot. This is your story as much as it is mine.\u00a0\n\n\nI double up (if the plot calls for it) and play NCPs and I would appreciate if my partner could do the same. Please tell me about yourself when you PM me. Don't message me using the chat, I won't answer. Thanks.",

I am looking for someone who won't ghost or disappear without telling anything because I had that too many times. I expect at least a paragraph as a reply and not just a sentence.\n\n\nAs for the plot, I have an idea in my mind and I do have my character (Also a ref). I'll let you create your own character and we will see where we can take the rp after we discuss and share our characters. I want you to create your own character because It makes is more interesting and unexpected than if I choose your role. I am both okay with you playing both Female and Male character. Also, you should be willing to rp as NPC's as well (so will I)\n\nThe Rp I want to try:\n\u2022 Intimate/cute/sweet Romance Roleplay with minimum Nsfw elements and more Romantic parts.\n\nThanks for reading and I hope you are interested in roleplaying together, please write your fav colour at the title of your message so I'll know you read it all the way through the text and not just spamming.\n\nBye~",

With the formation of alliances, and the awakening of old rivalries, how long will that peace last when the Lords of the realm are forced to choose between brother and sister? How will the Crown respond when the North and the Iron Isles declare their independence during a Targaryen Civil War?\n\nRoleplay is currently ongoing, but we are always welcoming new characters to join us.

            "selftext": "Truth is. The game was rigged from the start.\"*  Those are the words that changed the course of history forever. After disposing of Courier 6 in Goodsprings, the chairman Benny attempted to overthrow the de facto ruler of the New Vegas Strip Robert House. Upon reaching the Fort, Benny was crucified by Caesar's Legion, and the platinum chip was used to destroy House's securitron army. This left only the Legion and NCR to fight for Hoover Dam.\n\n  \nThe NCR were pushed back from the dam, and fell to the Nevada/New California border. There the Bull and Bear locked arms in direct, open conflict. On NCR soil, crimson stained the land. The Legion was defeated, and retreated to four corners. Edward Sallow passes due to an unknown illness, brain cancer. Legate Lanius dies during the battle of the long 15, shot through the chest by an NCR sniper named Craig Boone. With the Legion out of the Mojave, the NCR swept in to capture New Vegas and wrest control from House. The Mojave becomes an NCR territory.  \n\n  \nThe year is 2295, the New California Republic seeks to expand their reach north into the Pacific northwest. A new, dangerous frontier to explore. Untouched pre-war ruins, secluded tribes, deadly mutants. The final frontier in the West. Welcome to Cascade, keep your big iron strapped and your spurs jingle jangling.\n\nThe frontier is a discord-based Fallout RP spanning almost all of the western United States, any length post, with a custom bot called CORE which mirrors the SPECIAL system of fallout 3 and New Vegas.

I am interested in role-playing/writing a story focusing on Skeletor &amp; Evil-Lyn. Yet, it's a bit of re-imagination with Evil-Lyn and a bit of storytelling that departs from \"canon\" or anything from the He-Man and the MOTU mythos. I loved how you set up Snake Mountain in the beginning of your story. However, I'd love to have a story that has them as this power couple, well after Keldor becomes Skeletor. In other words, a romance tale. Set when they first meet, but chronicles their conquest of Eternia.   \n\n\nEvil-Lyn stays in love with Skeletor after his new look. I know in your version and others they fell out of love. Yet, I think it would be amazing if Skeletor and Lyn had a child together, a daughter. Lyn is a fiery spirit, but knows she wants a man to love, and Keldor/Skeletor is that. And I think we can keep some of attributes in the 200x cartoon, where she playfully annoys Skeletor, but loves to drive him crazy. For example, she does \"back talk\" to him and make \"fun\" of her lover in front of the other minions, but she is his equal. The rest of the Evil Warriors know they're sleeping together. Yet, I think Lyn would love to play with Skeletor and have fun with him. Yes, she'll plot to have power for herself, but know she has to bring him into the mix for it. She needs him. They need each other.   \n\n\nShe loves him and knows she belongs to him. In essence, she knows she's his henchwoman, but right-hand and lover. She's his future queen.  \n\n\nI think there is a serious treatment to explore here in terms of a story.   \n\n\nI'm looking for anyone willing to help me make this come alive on Discord or even a Google Doc.   \n\n\nPlease message me if interested.

I'm only on Chapter 10 but I absolutely ADORE this game and would love to share my passion with someone.\n\nI'm looking to play F!Blyeth with anyone playing another canon character. OC's can be discussed though. I post anywhere between one paragraph to seven or eight paragraphs depending on response and mood. I'm also looking for someone 18+ as I would like to dabble in a romance plot but it's not needed as I love story building as well.\n\nIf you're interested please message me and we'll talk!",

            "selftext": "\"A lipstick lesbian is slang for a lesbian who exhibits a greater amount of feminine gender attributes relative to other gender expressions, such as wearing make-up, wearing dresses or skirts and having other characteristics associated with feminine women.\"\n\nSome people can't tell when a girl likes other girls at first glance. But that's fine, sometimes it's difficult. The stereotypical lesbian looks pretty trashy, admittedly. But there are those that take care of themselves, wear make up and perfume and don't drive trucks. Getting past that, the person themselves can act vastly different from what you'd expect.\n\nThis is the particular case of one girl who felt as though things around her love life would work themselves out, even though most of the people she associated with weren't exactly her type. Namely because they were guys that she knew through friends. She knew that she wasn't attracted to them, and was especially nice about it, and they left her alone about it. Until that one fateful day...\n\nBut that's getting ahead of things. At her school, she had a reputation of being nice to everyone and a fairly good student. When she caught wind of a rumor of a private school student coming to spend her last two years at her school, a public one. It wasn't a big deal to her, until she started at that school. The new girl, Cecil was her name, probably short for Cecilia, but no one ever asked. Her hair was long, wavy and jet black, decent sized body and a somewhat athletic body from snowboarding, an exotic sport in their little town where everyone knew everyone. She liked to wear short cut T-shirts, baggy jeans and sneakers, mostly just glad she didn't need to wear a uniform. \n\nOne day, Cecil came up to this girl in front of the school and tapped her on the shoulder. The sight of her sent this pour girl's heart aflutter, bringing along the butterflies in her stomach and the weakness in her knees. As a result, she couldn't answer the new girl's question, which resulted in her apologizing and moving to ask someone else. And these few things set in motion a turn of events she never could've expected in a million years.\n\n*So that's the prompt. The idea here is that your character is the girly girl that falls for my not quite so girly girl. I'd like for them to explore a lot of things together and I'm really hoping for this to be long term. As for your character, all I ask is that she be the girly girl I've explained, she can have any kind of personality, hobbies, what have you that you want. So yeah, if you're interested just send me your questions and stuff.*",

            "selftext": "Howdy! I'm looking for an 18+ partner willing to do a F/F roleplay either in a world we build together, or under the fandom Fire Emblem: Three Houses. For the latter, I'd prefer we do canon x canon, where either one of us plays any of the three characters: F!Byleth, Edelgard, or Dorothea. I'm open to other characters as well, but it would need to be discussed. I just finished up my first route (Crimson Flower, of course!), so some characters of the other houses I'm unfamiliar with. \n\nAs for the medieval fantasy roleplay, I'm very lenient with that! I'm down to do high magic, low magic, or even none. I'm just not really interested in a very gritty or hardcore world; I'm looking for something more casual rather than realistic, if that makes sense! We can have a more adventurous plot, with action, romance and angst, or do something more domestic with a family, fluff and well, more romance. It's entirely up to us, so if you're interested, hit me up!\n\nMy preferred platform is Discord, but I'm willing to try email, or even Kik if it really comes down to it. I'm willing to write a variety of lengths, from one-liners to paragraphs, though the latter is my preferred at 2-3 paragraphs per reply. \n\nHope this has piqued your interest!",

A classic tale if a man returning home from war, all the adjustments and turmoil that comes with it, a lot of character development and exploration, etc etc. Normally I love fantasy and would even be down to play a fantasy in the same time period, but it's originally set up to be played more realistically.  I'm no historian or WWI expert but I'd very much like to learn a little about it for the purposes of writing this story. NSFW elements are a possibility so as such I'd like to only play with people 18+, it can be discussed what/if/how much to involve.\nCheck out the bellow prompt to see my set up and writing style and let me know if interested!\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nLena stared out the kitchen window as the morning fog slithered between the flowers in her garden, dampening the world and curling her chestnut hair with the humidity. She found herself often staring out of this window, sipping her tea and watching the footpath that led from her garden to road that dipped down the hill to the village by the sea. The autumn was a cool one after a long summer had stretched well into September, and Lena had often found herself sitting in the long grass at the top of the hill, where she could see if he disembarked the train bellow, it's steam billowing up obscuring her view until it chugged away, revealing her disappointment. There was word that the great war was finally ending, that the men, those who had survived, would be returning home. She hadn't heard from her John in months, but she refused to listen to reason from her family that perhaps he was never going to be on the train. \n\nShe was a pretty young woman, with a beguiling figure and soft, lovely features that spoke of youth and some naivety. Her blue eyes were often wide and observant, though recently rimmed with red and sunken from lack of sleep, her full lips pursed in worry and her skin a touch sallow. She dreamed nightly of him, standing on a battlefield, dirt flying into flurries of death all around him. She'd call out his name, screaming for him to run, but he'd only stand there as he was swallowed by yellow acrid smoke. She'd wake in a cold sweat, gripping her bedclothes and sobbing, and wouldn't be able to sleep again for the night. \n\nHer eyes glazed over as her thoughts drifted, when suddenly something stirred within the mist. A shadow grew, taking the form of a man, and as he approached the teacup she was holding fell to the floor, shattering with a crash as she ran to the door.",

Mortals of course have very little knowledge of this secret world of witches, sorcerers and warlocks that resides in their own. It is up to individuals like Damian to keep Mortals safe and from witnessing any evidence of magic. Anyone finding themselves with evidence of magic are subsequently delt with in a non lethal manner of course. However, On this certain day,you will find yourself being wrapped in a world you didn't know existed in the first place.\n\nRoleplay regulations:\n\n1. please be creative. \n2. If you're gonna be busy or absent for a prolonged period of time,please let me know.\n3. Must be literate. Not looking for any over the top novela writting though.\n4.

            "selftext": "Hello!\n\n\nI don\u2019t really have much to say here. I'm probably gonna take a nap soon, but that's just about it. Anyways, onto ideas that I have, listed in order of interest.\n\n\n1) A Futuristic roleplay. I have an idea that I\u2019ve been working on for a while, though is in a completely unorganized state, that I would love to try finally putting into play. To explain it without going on a tangent, it\u2019s focused on Earth, instead of space and other planets, where Mercenary groups have become way larger, and have even taken the place of emergency services to an extent. It\u2019s heavily inspired by the Cyberpunk genre as a whole. This would involve a good bit of plotting and extra world building beforehand, with action taking a heavy focus in the story.\n\n\n2) Something based on a fandom. I\u2019m mostly looking for romance here, in contrast to the idea above, and Canon x Canon or Canon x OC. I\u2019m mostly looking for something based on the Anime Yuru Camp or Miss Kobayashi\u2019s Dragon Maid (Which I\u2019m also caught up in the Manga of.), but I\u2019m open to discussing other ones.\n\n\n3) And back to action\u2026 Something Post-apocalyptic. I\u2019m not looking for the Zombie-slaying power-fantasy, where issues only arise when it\u2019s convenient to the plot. No, I\u2019m looking for characters trying to survive in an unfriendly world, where morals need to be thrown away to keep a full belly and your head on your neck. I do have a few ideas, along with a character.\n\n\nOnto rules and info.\n\n\n-I\u2019m looking for posts of about one or two paragraphs in length, written in a way that I don\u2019t need to be a master in code cracking to understand them. More is welcome.\n\n\n-I\u2019m looking for partners who will help build plot when needed, and help throw things in the pot when it slows down.\n\n\n-I NEED a partner able to play multiple characters alongside their own. It\u2019s not that I can\u2019t, but that it helps make things more lively and make the worlds seem less empty.\n\n\n-I will not relinquish total control of my character. Only in special cases will I allow my character to be controlled by someone else, and even then, I doubt it would come up.\n\n\n-I\u2019m looking for about 2-3 posts a week. While I do hope for more, and I lack any semblance of a life offline, I know people can have busy schedules and can\u2019t have a post ready whenever I want. If the \u2018quota\u2019 is not realistic that week, I\u2019d appreciate a warning. Even if it\u2019s a short message in a dead language, I\u2019d like to be told such.\n\n\n-I like to chat with my partners outside of roleplay, so beware.\n\n\n-My timezone is EST. I\u2019m not looking for partners around my timezone, but it\u2019s an important bit of info.\n\n\n-I usually play female characters, but don\u2019t mind playing a male one. I\u2019m good with any character pairing. (MxM, FxF, MxF.)\n\n\n-My platform of preference is Discord, though I'm willing to discuss other apps and such.\n\n\nThat\u2019s it, I guess.\n\n\nInterested? Send me a PM detailing what has your interest the most.\n\nGot a question? Ask below.\n\nHotel? TriVaGo.",

            "selftext": "*Never felt at home in reality, always hide behind avatars*.\n\nThe Oasis is much like its namesake, a digital safe zone in the middle of a world circling the drain. A future made desolate by economic ruin and fading resources is kept on life support by what Humanity has begun to cling to in an attempt to stay afloat for just a few more years, until something changes - *If* it changes.\n\nBut that's neither here nor there. The Oasis has been snatched up by a wave of hysteria. People the world over, and the hundreds of worlds in the Oasis, are all scrambling to find three keys to unlock the door to a fortune with more zeroes than a string of binary. Half a trillion dollars and ownership of the Oasis itself are up for grabs, but you've gotta know what to look for. Dubbed the \"Hunt for the Egg\", it has since petered off, but recently some no name hunter found the first key, and now everything is back to a fever pitch.\n\nOne titan of industry stands in the way. IOI - Innovative Online Industries - is hot on the heels of this first find, with resources only a world wide corporation could have, and their plans include advertising dense enough to provoke outright seizures during prolonged exposure. Needless to say, that's not good for your health in a world where every facet of life, from leisure to work and even marriages tend to happen and your bank account in game is more or less what you live off of. Can't hack it in the arena? Get killed and loose that hard earned coin stash? Have fun scrounging in the dumpster for ham scraps, you six piece chicken mcnobody.\n\nAll that remains to be asked is this: Will you hunt for the egg and lead the way to fixing what's become inherently broken? Or will you follow someone else's lead and hope for the best? The choice is yours, in whatever form you take.\n\n*Saving the world that's tough but let's give it a shot, 'till you tell me game over*.\n\n-----\n\nHello! If you've made it this far, thanks for reading! I'm looking for a partner willing to do a Ready Player One roleplay, and I'd like to experience both the plot of the movie, but more importantly, I'd like to explore the Oasis with someone.\n\nThat being said, it's not necessary to have seen the movie, or read the book, but what *is* necessary is to be willing to make things up as we go! Loosely, sort of. Given the sheer scale of easter eggs in both the book and movie, the limits are endless. It can be dark and gritty, or it could be a slice of life style tale. Maybe something action oriented or a dialogue driven bonding session that can lead to something deeper when the masks are off and the online handles are set aside.\n\nI love the book, the movie, the universe in general, but what I love most about them is the concept of it all. It's a wide open sea of possibilities that can go anywhere without any real constraints, and the freedom of it has kept my mind on it since I first read the book a few years back.\n\nThis is getting pretty long, so if you've stayed with me, thanks for making it here! A bit about me is I have nearly a decade of experience writing, and I can write both third and person, and depending on what's going on almost always at least a paragraph, if not a handful of them. I also like to make friends with my partners, so if you're chatty, that's a bonus! I'm hiding this here, but send your message with \"Gunship\" in your subject so I know you at least skimmed through this.\n\nNow, I do have one hard limit, and it's that you be over 18, just because I feel more comfortable given the potential of gore/violence/other stuff. That can all be discussed on a per person basis, though. I'm interested in both parties being happy with it, rather than one or the other. \n\nNow, time to close this all off. If you're interested, please send me a message and we'll see if we can make something work!",

            "selftext": "My character is a prince from a mighty kindgom controlled by an oligarcy, meaning a small group of people govern the kingdom. This small group is a covern of magic users, using the power of their birthright to rule with an iron fist over their kindgom. \n\nThis covern, known as the Gemini, functions as any other would if you are familiar with the concept (magical experiements, sharing knowledge, hording power) except that they have a generational power in that every generation is lead by a set of twins, bounded spiritually to one another- sharing their power- and therefore the most powerful of all of the covern. The Gemini host rituals and ceremonies often throughout pregnancy to funnel all of their power into creating these twins. These rituals cause the twins to have their own individual magic abilites- such as elemental ones like frost or lightning, or more mystic ones, such as controlling minds, flight, or controlling plants. These abilities change their physical appearence and actually make them look different from each other (with different color skin, eyes, and other enhanced characteristics related to their power). Once they are born they are nurtured and trained typically by the previous set, who would still be the leaders before their birth, leading them to be their replacements in the covern. Once they discover and master their powers in the Mystic Arts they become the monarchs of the Gemini Kingdom.\n\n\nYour character grows up adopted/an orphan nearly half way across the world. One day, due to a stressful, pressuring event, they experience a spiritual awakening/breakthrough in their power which sends a shockwave to their long lost twin, allowing him to use his magic to trace and find his twin. He rushes from his kingdom to reunite with that piece of his family. And so the grand story of the reuniting of the Gemini Twins begins. \n\nTurns out the separating of the twins was a tactical effort to weaken the Gemini Covern- without their set of twins to lead them, this generation would be exposed to enemies. And thus for the last few years a war has been raging on between the Gemini and an alliance between several other coverns and supernatural groups (wolves, hags, vampires) that want to claim the title of most powerful kindgom in the world. \n\nNow that the Gemini Twins have been reunited, perhaps the war can come to an end? Or is everything not as it seems? Many suprises await.\n\nThere is much of the story left to tell.\n\nLiterate, third person, present tense, all that stuff. The great thing about this roleplay is that instead of romance, which lets face it isnt meant to be between every couple, its about siblings who can learn to love each other through any differences. Since we're supposed to be twins and Im 18 the only thing I require of your character is that they're around that age as well. 16-25 I guess and I'll match it. And y'know we can decide what kind of special abilities they're going to have later. Pm and we can make a Discord or whatever. But Im only doing this with one person so if I already found somone I'll just delete this",

I\u2019m a 21 year old female looking for anyone 19-28 that can play a male character whether you\u2019re actually male, female, non-binary, etc. it doesn\u2019t matter to me what you are in real life. I prefer to roleplay on Discord! All my plots are safe for work. I do NOT write smut. My roleplays typically focus on drama and romance with a hint of action depending on the role. I am pretty much advanced lit. Writing anywhere from a couple to multiple paragraphs. I only write in third person. Please be creative when messaging me if you\u2019re interested. All \u2018hi\u2019s and \u2018hey\u2019s will be ignored. I\u2019m also interested/have ideas in/for things such as witches, vampires, Vikings, and other things. Here\u2019s a whole list of roleplays I currently have plots for:\n\n*The Wolves* Many years ago a young girl was attacked by a pack of wolves in a place where wolves aren\u2019t common. A twist on your cliche werewolf story.\n\n*The Contract* the two top young rising celebrities don\u2019t get along at all, for various reasons. What happens when their managers go behind their backs and set the two up on a date? Forcing them to sign a six month contract , claiming to be a couple in the public eye. \n\n*The Vlog* Our characters are both vloggers and split up long ago. But what happens when they meet at a convention again? What does (Y/C) do when he finds out that (m/c)\u2019s new boyfriend is planning to propose to her? She doesn\u2019t know, but it\u2019s been told to him. How will the two handle running into each other days before everything could change?\n\n*Faking It* A young girl is making her way through life by stripping at a high end club for business men. She has a regular visitor that spends much more on her in an hour than most do the entire night. She practically only comes into work for him. But what happens when he\u2019s told he can only further his career in his family\u2019s company by settling down? He\u2019s been lying about having a girlfriend for years...\n\n*The Selection* A slight futuristic twist on your modern day Bachelor/Bachelorette reality tv show. Involves royals, rebels and so much more.\n\n*Fandoms* we can discuss Game of Thrones, Avatar the Last Airbender, Star Wars, and Harry Potter",

            "selftext": "Hello all! I've been roleplaying for about 10 years now as of recently and have done all sorts of roleplays from adventure and romance to horror and fantasy. I go by PST time but I'm usually up really late. I'm looking for some new partners to help replenish the ghosters. I'm open to different plots and types of rp. Just a few rules first:\n\n- I rp in first person, present tense, paragraph style so I would appriciate the same.  \n\n- 18+ only in case of any NSFW scenes, no exceptions.\n\n- No requirements on length of response but it must add to the roleplay and progress the story or else I will call it out. One liners with zero description won't do. \n\n- No ghosting, if you have an issue with the rp or myself or you just want to move on, please tell me. I promise I wont take any offense to it. The worst I will do is ask why you want to leave. \n\n- Be responsive. For any rp to work, both partners need to be fairly active so it never gets stagnant. I get that we are busy with life however I do expect multiple replies per day and if that isnt possible at least tell me you wont be around though I get that emergencies happen but if it goes 2+ days and I havent heard anything, I will send my goodbyes and leave. My time is just as valuable as yours so mutual respect is all I ask. \n\n- As for grammar and spelling, it doesnt have to be perfect and I'm not picky just no text talk and try your best to spell accurately. As long as it makes sense it should be fine. \n\n- I will NOT do smut only rps, any story we do must have a story and smut is a side thing. \n\nAnyways, I think that's everything! Shoot me a message if you have any questions or are interested in roleplaying! We can discuss plots there and I mainly do romance mixed with something else we like so I can tailor it to our likes. I hope to hear from you soon! ^.^",

I have 3+ years of roleplay experience, so I am definitely  capable of a variety of styles and genres to roleplay in, though most of  my roleplays are slice-of-life romance roleplays, MxM to be precise. I  am not comfortable doing a romance roleplay with a female character,  though if you yourself are female and you wish to roleplay as male, that  is completely fine.\n\nI love to  talk outside of the roleplay as well, and I have to be blunt about it; I  have an eccentric personality, and my favourite type of humour can be  viewed as offensive by some, you are hereby warned. If you are incapable  of handling offensive jokes or comments you are not the person I am  looking for. I do not set out to offend, it is just that my humour and  certain opinions are sometimes viewed as offensive by more sensitive  people. Now then, for the roleplay, I have set up some basic rules that  you must be able to oblige.\n\n* AT LEAST 5 full sentences per response\n* Third-person\n* Past tense\n* Grammatically correct\n* At least one response per day\n* Be  committed to Roleplay! I realize that Roleplay is not your job, but I am sick of being ghosted whenever life gets a little busy. Just talk to me and I will fully understand that you can't roleplay when you're too busy with school or your job. \n\nI  really hope that I have piqued your interest and you are willing to  roleplay with me. I use discord as my roleplaying platform, so you will  have to give me your discord username through PM if you wish to roleplay  with me.\n\nP.S, I am on top!",

            "selftext": "So... I'm really tired of the ghosting, lack of communication etc and I'm currently strictly looking for the type of roleplayers that enjoy writing one plot after another with a couple of people rather than switching rp partners every 72 hours ;p If that's not your cup of tea, then please don't read any further or reach out because we're not going to be a good match.\n\nNow that that's out of the way... My name is Liam, I'm 21 years old and I'm currently enjoying my summer holiday (though I'll be active as well when college starts again of course!). I love writing and I'm currently writing a book, though next to that I really enjoy roleplaying. I write M/M and M/F romances next to the genres slice of life, drama and angst. (I won't reply to people asking me to write different genres.)\n\nHere's what I'm looking for writing-wise:\n\n\\- I like writing actively. Now I know not everyone has the time to shoot a couple replies a day, some days I can't either, but I do expect at least 1 reply every 2 days. If you get busy, just let me know and it won't be a dealbreaker as long as it doesn't happen over and over again.\n\n\\- Real life face claims only.\n\n\\- At least up to 10 sentences per reply. The longer the better.\n\n\\- 3rd person. No text talk. Proper English.\n\n\\- You must be 18+ in real life.\n\n\\- My characters don't top in m/m ships. This doesn't mean that they can't take control, but they do prefer to take it... You know what I mean. I'm looking for manly, confident characters. Feminine, extremely shy, you name it doesn't interest me to roleplay as or with.\n\n**- If you're someone who can't be honest when they don't like someone and would rather ghost than talk about it, don't add me. I, myself, will tell you when I don't like an idea or something that's going. I expect my writing partners to do the same as well. This way, we can find a solution rather than either of us feeling like we've wasted our time on each other.**\n\n\\- It's a plus if you enjoy talking outside of the roleplay as well as constantly coming up with ideas and shipping our characters : )\n\nIf you're interested in writing, please shoot me an introduction here. If I think we're a good match I'll either add you on discord if you've added yours or shoot you my own : )\n\nHappy writing! : D",

I am looking for a writer of female characters (writer themselves IRL can be any gender) to write to a specific theme / setting.\n\nAt the moment I am most interested in the following: - Modern Day (real life) - Select fandom settings (Overwatch, Final Fantasy, Warcraft, \\****Sword Art Online\\****, League, any kind of MMO-like setting, etc.)\n\n**What I'm looking for (Someone who...)**\n\n\\- Has at least a little bit of an idea of what they want to write and in an RP partner.\n\n\\- Writes in the third person.\n\n\\- For Fandom setups, preferably plays OCs - but this will vary depending on the scenario.\n\n\\- Is at least moderately accurate with spelling / grammar.\n\n\\- Is hopefully okay with making a friend outside of the roleplay. \u2661\n\n\\- Is patient and understands that life happens, so sometimes posting frequency will vary.\n\n\\- Is okay with NSFW themes - this can be discussed in PM, please include this in your introduction.\n\n\\- Is okay with each of us just playing a single character (no doubling, etc.)\n\n**What I'm offering (About me...)**\n\n\\- I am a cis-gendered female who is in her late 20's and can either be entirely RP-focused or someone who is willing to chat OOC. \u2661\n\n\\- I can write decently well with roleplay; English is my first language and I can either be pretty descriptive or I can be more general, depending on both the scene and my partner's style.\n\n\\- Post length varies based on what is going on and sometimes can be a sentence or two (interaction between characters) or it can be a paragraph or two (I am usually not very long-winded unless it is an opener)\n\n\\- A few days each week for dedicated RP time with a few times sprinkled here and there for more random endeavors.\n\n\\- I am told I have little filter; I can be very forward, blunt, even painfully honest at times so someone who is good at sugar-coating things is probably not me.\n\n\\- Yes, the Canadian stereotype can be true, and I can sometimes be nice to a fault, so I ask that my partners are mindful of that and don't take advantage of that trait in me.\n\n*If I have piqued your interest at all, please PM with any questions!

I\u2019m currently looking for a roleplay that would be either focused on a lesbian romance(nsfw would be fine but not the focus) that could be with characters from a fandom or just our own. Please note that while I don\u2019t care what gender you are irl, for this one your character would need to be a female.\n\nOne of the ideas I have for a set up would be simple with us as roommates that start to fall in love with each other over time, this would be a bit slower most likely but it can be faster if you\u2019d prefer!\n\nAnother of my ideas is one of our characters is a well off, charitable person. The other person would be going through hard times, maybe homeless and the first character helps them. The help could form into a roommate idea as well, or it could simply be meeting in the same place to talk and work through problems where they get closer.\n\nI have a few other ideas for starts but I\u2019d love to hear yours too so don\u2019t be afraid to share at all!\n\nThe roleplay can have nsfw elements and it\u2019s up to you if it\u2019s included or not!

I'm gonna try my best to keep this short and sweet!\n\n**Please try to not use reddit chat as I do not frequently check it.**\n\n----\n\nI am a female, and I'm 20 years old. I'm just looking for somebody to roleplay some good ole modern-day romantic slice of life with. I have grown tired of the fast-paced sci fi adventure stories, and the stressful horror plots. I just want to be a regular degular human navigating through a regular degular human relationship!\n\n----\n\n**What I\u00a0*don't*\u00a0want:**\n\n\n- Anybody under the age of 18. (Preferably 20+.)\n\n\n- Very long eplies. Yes, it's good to be literate, I definitely don't want one liners or borderline incomprehensable replies, but if you're looking for somebody to write you a novel... I'm not your girl. A good couple of paragraphs is enough! Maybe less - if we're at a mundane stage of the roleplay.\n\n\n- NSFW scenes. I know it's a natural part of any relationship, I would just rather is be *fade-to-black* style. Ie: alluded to, but we don't actually have to write out the scenes. I will do it every now and then if you want to, but mainly I'd prefer fade-to-black.\n\n\n- Very dark plots. I don't want to be part of the mafia.\n\n\n- Any sort of OOC photo trading. I'm not going to send you a selfie of me and I don't expect one of you either. I prefer using face claims for our characters.\n\n----\n\n**What I\u00a0*do*\u00a0want:**\n\n- Simple plots. Even cheesy, cliche plots. (New roommates? Long time best friends growing feelings for each other? You broke into my apartment while drunk one night? We hate each other but we both have a mutual friend so we have to put up with each other? I dunno! Hit me with your favorite plot and we can figure something out. :))\n\n\n- Character descriptions beforehand. Physical descriptions, photo refs, likes and dislikes. Any basic information to give us something to go off of.\n\n\n- Clear communication between us! It's totally fine if we don't click like you thought we would, or if you got bored, or if you're going to be busy. I'd just rather get a warning before ghosting. No questions asked at all! And I'll have the same respect for you. :)\n\n----\n\nI use kik and discord (with a preference for discord). So PM me and we can figure something out for us!",

Even still, I'm trying to find someone who'd be willing to play John Hancock ***and/or*** Nick Valentine alongside an alternate universe sole survivor of mine! If you aren't comfortable writing poly stuff or just don't want to play two characters, that's totally fine and I'm perfectly happy with just one of the guys. I'll gladly write a canon character for you as well, whether that be canon/canon or canon/oc. I've written as MacCready, Deacon, Danse, and Maxson thus far but I'm open to trying other characters as well! I'm also open to writing oc/oc with you if you don't have any canon/oc pairings yourself (I have so many original characters oh my goodness). So if you're interested, please feel free to shoot me a DM (chat doesn't seem to work for me?) and we can plot some stuff out and get to know each other!\n\n**some extra info:** EST, 10+ years of writing experience, will provide writing samples, smut not required at all, loves angst, fluff, original plot points and open-minded interpretations to canon!",

            "selftext": "Greetings everyone! I\u2019m searching for some fellow Eorzeans that would love to write with me, with ShadowBringers stories being included! (We\u2019ll talk about them in private.) I\u2019ve been playing the game for three years now, and I\u2019ve been doing my best to research the lore. :)\n\nHowever, dealing with the scenarios, I\u2019m really wanting Canon Characters, but if you have a good written OC/WoL, I\u2019ll see if I can accept them. But there are no guarantees. \n\nFor canon characters, I\u2019m looking for the following:\n\n&gt;ARR Arch:\n\n-Lahabrea: My character, after defeating Gaius and the Ultima Weapon, is forced to fight Lahabrea alone as a true test of strength.\n\n&gt;Dragonsong Arch:\n\n-Estinien: Before he\u2019s possessed by Nidhogg, it becomes a love-hate relationship between him and Tovah. After possession, it can either be an intense moment between them (emotionally) or passionately intense.\n\n&gt;Stormblood Arch:\n\n-Zenos: Tovah becomes temporarily cornered by Zenos, or a battle becomes a bit too \u2018personal\u2019. This can also include a forbidden love/secret lovers situation, or a love-hate relationship.\n\n&gt;ShadowBringers:\n\n-Emet Selch\n\n-Crystal Exarch\n\n&gt;Misc:\n\n-Alphanaud: This scenario could start in Stormblood, before he leaves for Garlemald, after my character finds him in Shadowbringers. Or, it could start in A Realm Reborn where they just meet.\n\n-Thancred: This would probably be best to start after Minfilia is gone.\n\nAnd as for your own Warrior of Light, we can either meet each other through a raid, dungeon, or just find each other in town. It can also be a clean story or mixed story.\n\nIf we\u2019re going with pairing my character with yours, here\u2019s some key things to know:\n\n-Please be male. I do not accept female characters.\n\n-Miqo\u2019te, Hyur, Male Viera (your male viera needs will come alive, finally), and Au Ra are preferred!\n\n(There is much more information to my scenarios and wants for both your Warrior of Light and the Canon Characters, but my words are limited here.)\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in the scenarios, I\u2019ll be playing as my Warrior of Light, Tovah Wulf. More information on her will be sent once I\u2019m messaged! (I play on PS4, so sadly no modded images.)\n\nPlease PM me for my contact information!",

I can do modern or medieval, but no sci-fi, no end of the world, no futuristic, no dragons and mermaids and ogres. I like romance, lots of drama, maybe some action? or maybe adventure? Depends on the roleplay! I am open to playing all kinds of characters! (But no FxF) I can play male, female, gay, straight... You name it. There is going to be some stuff I won't do, but just ask and I'll let you know!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't currently have any ideas to post on here because I don't want people to think that it's all I'll do! I like roleplaying a lot of different things and I'd love to hear your ideas, or perhaps we could just come up with something together, the old fashioned way!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI like to write as much as I can, but it doesn't always have to be something ten posts long. Haha. That being said, I'm not going to roleplay with someone who only gives me about three lines or text for a response. I very often hit the 2000 character limit on Discord, so keep that in mind if you're looking for a reference on how much I write. I can cross the 2000 character limits, once, twice, even three times for a response depending on what I have to go off of. Yes, I understand that sometimes the characters are just talking so the responses won't be as long, but I would expect them to pick up length as we moved on to other scenes instead of staying at dialogue length.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNO TEXT TALK\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHope to talk to you soon! (And please leave your Discord tag in your message! It'll make it easy on me since I just can't hold good conversations on Reddit. XD) I'm in eastern time! If that matters. XD",
