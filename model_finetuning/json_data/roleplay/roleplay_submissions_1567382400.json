            "selftext": "I\u2019m not gonna lie, I\u2019m mainly here because I need to improve my creativity and find inspiration to draw more. And what\u2019s a better way to do so than world-building..? To be fully honest though, I don\u2019t even need us to role play. I just want some vivid world building so that I can draw it haha. So if you dislike my writing too much to rp but you\u2019re still up for world-building, I am too. \ud83d\udc4d \n\nHere\u2019s a crapy sketch (yeah, that\u2019s how far my motivation takes me on my own right now) I made to give you a very vague idea of my art: [https://imgur.com/a/3C9NrlM](https://imgur.com/a/3C9NrlM)  \n\nI can render things pretty realistically, but almost never do due to my lacking motivation\u2026 So please help. Even better if you're an artist yourself! But not necessary.\n\n \n\n**Yes** \n\n* Magic, supernatural, sci-fi or other low/high fantasy themes. \n* Original ideas. \n* Interesting relationships. This goes for all forms of relationships, romantic as non-romantic ones. \n* Any pairing except hetero, preferably. Poly is ok too. \ud83d\udc4d \n* Any gender. Binary, non-binary, etc. \n* Any race. The more creative the better! I love myself a cool monster oc. \n* Clever/deep plots. \n* Playing multiple characters and NPCs. \n* Mutual efforts in creating and pushing things forward. \n* Ooc talk, in case there was any doubt.  \ud83d\ude00 \n* Discord  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**No** \n\n* Modern slice of life. I personally have enough of that as it is hah.. \n* Fandoms. \n* Just anything that\u2019s too normal or over used. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**My writing** \n\nOh here\u2019s he good part. Sadly I have a pretty bad case of dyslexia. Which to me means I take ages reading/writing the same thing others might finish in minutes. I\u2019ll still reply daily or almost daily and I might write longer or shorter replies depending on what\u2019s happening in the story. But I\u2019d prefer our normal lenght not to be overwhelmingly long as I won\u2019t be able to keep up or even enjoy that. So maybe a normal range between 80-300 words (1-3 paragraphs)?  \n\nAnd probably the hardest part for you; I also have never role played in novel style. I\u2019m willing to try but if it doesn\u2019t work out well, I\u2019d be forever grateful if you were open minded about experimenting with other possible alternatives. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo.. will you go down the road of pretty much selling your rp-soul to the devil(me) for some pretty ok visuals of our story?   \nPlease say yes.",

I'll keep it somewhat brief and details in this can be changed at request or mutual agreement. I'll refer to your character as 'you' and mine as 'me' although third person is also possible, we can decide later. \n\nSo the story starts with you, late at night. Maybe you're depressed, lonely, studying all night, a victim of bullying perhaps. And what it causes is a 3AM \"down the Internet Rabbit Hole\" scenario. Where you end up finding an angel summoning spell. \n\nAnd like any normal person, what do you do in your tired, half delusional stupor? You chalk the seven pointed star, scribble in the name from random symbols and mix the ingredients. And there I appear. An Archangel in your very own living room. \n\nEvidently I'm not happy. Suddenly sent to another place by an unbreakable spell. I can't just disappear, or break it. I'm stuck with this random human. And I can say no to your requests, of course. But I'm stuck. Which sucks.\n\nMaybe I have to take the form of a student and act as your bodyguard at college? Maybe I'm your study buddy, or just a friend from somewhere else who moved. And eventually a romance ensues between us. I break down my barriers and then.. Well... We get together. And you'll realise the more I tell you, I'm not the best Archangel.",

If you love super heroes, drama, laughs, banter, romance, unique characters, and rich plots then read on!\n\nOur server is unique in that every member of the RP is active, and there is a central plot with strong direction and organization to move the story forward, instead of a free-for-all open world with no accountability. Our server is friendly and helpful, and there is always something to do.\n\nThe Plot:\nYou will be playing a new generation of superpowered humans 50 years after the mass murder and disappearance of all classic heroes and villains. While browsing you tumbled upon an online forum recruiting young people looking to rebel by putting their powers to good use and defeat the evildoers roaming their city. You sent in a request and received directions to Headquarters, where you finally met all the young heroes you'd been speaking to anonymously online. This was the beginning of your second life.\n\nThere's a wide array of characters, each carrying out their own initiatives day to day and putting their safety on the line to help one another during missions. However, there are also villains crawling out of the dark corners of the city\u2013 corrupt beings that threaten the public and presenting new obstacles for the secret group of crime fighters. The heroes have definitely signed up for something much greater than they had anticipated, but backing out is not an option.\n\nSome additional notes,\n-We are a very active and very welcoming group who chat and plot and get each other involved in the story!\n-The writing level is multi-paragraph, with good spelling and grammar skills.\n-We aren\u2019t accepting any members under 18 years old.\n-As of right now we are only recruiting heroes and not villains.\n\nShoot me a message for the Discord link if you're interested!",

However, I am also seeking to dwell into the popular genre of romance with action, drama and suspense. Been loving this prompt for quite some time! \n\n* For a little background Maul has always been one of my favorite sith villains in the entire franchise and his ever expanding character development has intrigued me from the very beginning. As I\u2019m sure...we all have that one character that clicks for us.\n\nThis role would take place either during the Clone Wars or Rebels universe. My character would be a female human Jedi spending her days thriving and surviving in the time of war. With that being said I am looking for a partner who would be willing to play Maul. (I also wouldn\u2019t mind playing in a different time period/setting). \n\nThe plot is a simple one in which this female Jedi and Sith have developed an understanding for each other that has blossomed into something forbidden. They have spent many years keeping a low profile on their shared relation but things always almost prove to be difficult for the pair. With the brink of War and Maul\u2019s death it seems as though the two would never come face to face again. \n\nIn the years before the New Hope a Galactic Empire has risen, hunting down the last of the Jedi while new rebellions form. With this female Jedi missing and a well alive Maul thirsting for vengeance perhaps the two will meet again? \n\nThis is a rough idea and I would love to come up with a more complex plot or a different plot altogether if necessary. I want to thank everyone who has read this far. \n\nNow a little bit about me...\n* I have been role-playing for about 5+ years.\n* I prefer third person but will do first.\n* I tend to write multiple paragraphs and would prefer my partner do the same. (However, let me know your preference and we can work around it.) I can go up to 6+ paragraphs or around 3-4. \n\nIf anyone is interested go ahead and send over a PM. I would be happy to answer and address any questions or concerns you may have. \n\nHope everyone is having a splendid day or night. Happy role-playing!\n\n\u2022 Preferred platforms: Discord, Hangouts, PM, e-mail",

            "selftext": "# The Mars Project: Brief History &amp; Background\n\nTowards the end of the 21st century, shortly after the Solar Colonization bill was issued, the colonization of Mars began. Because of the decreasing natural resources on Earth, the ever-growing overpopulation crisis, and the political turmoil between nations, the colonization of Mars was a necessary step in order to keep humanity alive. The race to Mars shortly began between two private companies: Aerostars and SolarWorks. \n\nTwo private aerospace companies, Aeroworks and SolarWorks, spearhead the Mars colonization movement. With funding from both national governments and private investors, it took fourteen years to engineer and construct the structures that would support new life on Mars. Although Aerostars and SolarWorks work towards the same goal, a competition began between the two. Settling around Olympus Mons, Aerostars began underground settlements while SolarWorks built their base at the foot of the mountain, utilizing the mountains structure, the land, as well as parts of the underground.\n\nRoleplay begins twenty-five years after construction of both colonies have been completed. Tensions build up between the nations as they compete for who becomes the biggest powerhouse of Mars as well as who advances first   \n in terms of technology, political stability, and economy. \n\n# Broad Plotlines\n\nAlthough the roleplay is intended to be very open ended, there are a few themes and plotlines that may be interesting to explore. These include: \n\n\\- The tension between SolarWorks and Aerostars citizens and how their perceptions of one another might be exaggerated\n\n\\- The discrimination of artificially-born children as opposed to natural-born children \n\n\\- The unity between Aerostars and SolarWorks scientists/engineers who are willing to work together yet are expected to compete by their employers \n\n(More ideas can be added as time progresses or if anyone has any suggestions!)\n\n# Roles and Storylines\n\nThe specifics of the character is entirely up to you, though there are certain roles that would help with the storyline, especially the ones listed above. Some roles would include:\n\n\\- Engineers/Scientists for either Aerostars or SolarWorks\n\n\\- Everyday citizens for both Aerostars and SolarWorks \n\n\\- Mars-born generation (the first wave of children who were not born on Earth), both artificially and naturally born. \n\n\\- The volunteers who originally landed on Mars who now have families \n\n# Hello! \n\nIf you made it to the end, thank you and hi!\n\nThis is my first time posting on r/roleplay but I've been roleplaying online since 2011. I'm currently starting a Martian civilization roleplay with my SO and we are looking for a handful of other members who are interested in developing the story and playing along with us. Ideally, we would want the group to be less than 10 members (including ourselves) as a way for the roleplay to be more intimate and perhaps grow to be long-term (and to make friends along the way, yay!)\n\nThis is just the general idea and basis of the roleplay, but having others to add to the history and perhaps plan how the plot would eventually turn out to be would help a lot. The roleplay is based on a Discord server I have recently created. If you're interested, I would greatly appreciate a PM with a short introduction of yourself and perhaps why you're interested in The Mars Project, and I'll send you the link to the server afterwards! If you have any questions, I'd also be very happy to answer :) \n\n(Also, considering there's a 14-day wait period, if you come across this post a few days after it was created, please don't hesitate to still PM me if you're interested! I don't think I would be closing this off anytime soon.)",

            "selftext": "Hi there! I'm extremely nervous posting this, but here goes. I am a 36 year old female and I'm looking for a long-term role play partner or two that is at least 21+. Also looking for a role play partner that will be a friend to just chat to OOC. I role play mostly in anime and manga fandoms. I'm a semi-literate to literate role player. I only role play in third person. My time zone is Central Daylight Time. Would appreciate if you use a Face claim as real life pictures break immersion. Also, I am going to be upfront and tell you that I RP mostly to help distract me from my depression,anxiety and health issues that I won\u2019t get into, so please keep that in mind and be patient with me. There may be times when I will need a break from the roleplay(s) due to the aforementioned issues, but if that happens I will let you know.\n\n\nI role play as male characters. I'm not very good with role play fighting, but I do enjoy some lite role play fighting every now and then, and with some of my fandoms it's kind of a requirement. What I'm saying is, don't expect a really good role play fight scene out of me. \n\n\nI enjoy romantic role plays but I'm only interested in MxM and MxF pairings. Any potential role play partners of mine need to be open minded. I don't like it when pairing relationships have no conflicts, are too squeaky clean, predictable,etc. I don\u2019t like bland relationships. Fiery, passionate, heated, messy and sometimes dark or twisted relationships are kind of my thing, but I will also do more tame romantic role plays between pairings. OC x OC, CC x CC and OC x CC pairings are fine. While I am fine if your character has a serious/terminal interest or traumatized and tortured past, I would prefer that element doesn't take over the entire role play to where my character turns more into just a nurse and it interferes constantly with the story of the role play. I am only mentioning this upfront because I've had too many of these kinds of role plays and I am honestly tired of them and will quit a role play if this happens too much. I don't mind dark elements within reason in a role play, in fact I relish and embrace them. I want a roleplay with a good balance of light and dark. \n\n\nI am okay with smut, but I don't want a roleplay to be all about smut. If you take up my offer to be a role play partner and want our role play to include elements of this, we can discuss what I am willing to roleplay in this aspect in a DM. Of course, smut is not necessarily a requirement for me role playing with me. I do enjoy role playing it sometimes, but it\u2019s not an absolute must.\n\n\nI love the bishounen type of male characters and if I role play a pairing between my character and another, they'll have to fit that type. \n\n\nI have many fandoms. I have and will role play in a multitude of different anime and manga fandoms. I do not want to roleplay stories that have already been told, but rather things that happened before during or after all that. Depending on the plot, AU storylines and crossovers are a possibility and I've role played this type of stuff before.\n\n\nI am especially interested in role-playing as Hyuga Neji x Hyuga Hinata. This is one of my anime OTP. Yes, I am aware that their fathers are identical twins and that makes them cousins and genetically closer than most first cousins are.\n\n\nI am also interested in role-playing as Illumi Zoldyck from Hunter x Hunter, Yuno from Black Clover and Tomioka Giyuu from Demon Slayer.\n\n\nI love Black Butler. I will roleplay as Sebastian,Ciel,Grell,Undertaker and Ronald Knox. \n\n\nThis is a list of my fandoms. This is by no means a complete list and is included as just a sampling to illustrate \u00a0the different genres and shows I'm interested in.\n\n\nVampire Knight, My Hero Academia, Togainu no Chi, Air Gear, Beelzebub, Dororo, Bleach, Soul Eater, The Disastrous Life of Saiki K., Attack on Titan, NARUTO, Boruto, That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime, Grand Guignol Orchestra, Love Stage, How To Keep A Mummy, \u00a0Sailor Moon, Trinity Blood, Gintama, Haikyuu, Eyeshield 21, Captain Harlock, Black Jack, Galaxy Express 999, Shiki, Tokyo Ghoul, Katekyo Hitman REBORN. \n\n\nI roleplay by Kik or Line or I suppose we could roleplay by DM. I know a lot of people use Discord, \nbut I don't understand much how Discord works. \n\nIf you are interested, please DM me to discuss this a little further to see if we might be compatible role play partners. Thanks!",

            "selftext": "Hi there! My name is Bailey and I\u2019m in need of some new partners, as I am always trying to expand. I use kik, discord, or reddit for my roleplay. As for what I\u2019m looking for, I\u2019m not clear on what I\u2019m looking for plot-wise, but I can tell you this: \n\nI love romance, and it\u2019s a definite must, whether it\u2019s FxF or MxF, and I always play female. I\u2019m into drama, action, dark themes, supernatural, slice of life, horror, adventure, and pretty much all of the above. My imagination has troubles when it comes to fantasy and magic, though. \n\nSome loose ideas I\u2019d like to try out currently are:\nMafia/gang.\nFBI,\nEspionage,\nSports related, \nROMANCE in everything! \n\nSome fandoms:\nThe 100,\nPeaky Blinders,\nThe Vampire Diaries, \nSupernatural, \nQuantico,\nThe Society,\nAnd maybe a few more \n\nThose are just a few, but I\u2019m welcome to any ideas or plots you may have. \n\nLet me also mention this: I\u2019m not looking for a sex-based roleplay, but enjoy including it into the story as it fits, with an appropriate build. \n\nMy preference for style is 1st person, but I can do 3rd as well. I don\u2019t care about post length, and think a paragraph is just fine. I cannot find 2+ paragraphs fun, as I feel like it hinders the partners\u2019 abilities to move the story along. Although, when starting a new roleplay I can definitely see where length is necessary. It\u2019s just easier to bounce off of replies when they\u2019re shorter, especially with dialogue. \n\nIf you have any prompts, plots, or ideas you\u2019d like to discuss or roleplay, send me a message so we can get to creating something together. I hope you took time to read this, I tried to keep it short, so if you have any further comments/questions, message me! Thanks, Bailey.",

The main theme I like to play is romance but we can also add different elements into it if you wish. Please note though, fantasy is a big no! I would really appreciate it if you were reliable, and tell me if it got boring because then it's fair. If you ghost me, don\u2019t expect a sudden second chance. Of course we will both have our own personal lives but I\u2019ll always communicate healthily and let you know when I\u2019m busy. If you're going to message, be serious about this too and have a clear idea about what you want. I can do first or third person, I can change my preference if needs to be. Honestly, I will NOT accept one liners nor will I respond back to you if you're just gonna ghost. I've had enough of people just coming along for short-term purposes when this is LONG term. I cannot stress that enough.\n\nMy list:\n\n\\~Friends from childhood.\n\n\\~Roommates.\n\n\\~Nurse and Solider/veteran.\n\n\\~Prince/Princess falls for a village girl/boy.\n\n\\~Friends with benefits.\n\n\\~Rich Entrepreneur and interior designer.\n\n\\~Gang member and innocent girl.\n\n\\~Strangers.\n\nAnd of course, any other ideas you wish to tell me about. Yes I know these are mildly clich\u00e8, so I\u2019m willing to spice them up and add a lot more angst, or even some dark themes if it does fit with the idea. \n\nSmut will have a very small element in this, but it won't be too overpowering as I want to enjoy the story at its fullest - so it will be discussed fully once the plot has been established and there will always be a good build-up before any NSFW. When it happens though, I'll make sure to attend to your every need. I cannot stress this enough; Please be literate! (more than a paragraph at least). If you deliver on that, I will too. Roleplay is a two way mutual thing and it has to flow in order to keep a story going. \n\nThanks for reading! I use Reddit and kik. If you have any other platform, I\u2019ll be sure to download it if I can but I really do prefer the two I\u2019ve mentioned.",

            "selftext": "Cyphers, Spellchuckers, Mages, or simply just Magic Users. They exist in a world that doesn't want them, and for it, they are being hunted. This all started a few decades ago, when an odd glowing blue meteorite flew into the ocean with not many people noticing it. The meteorite was imbued with a special energy, that if which spread through the world by sea. It didn't seem to affect any sea life at the time, since the energy flowed in thin layers at the very surface of the water, but it did eventually reach land, affecting humans by giving them the ability to draw energy around them and use it to make whatever they could think of. Humans being humans, they feared the few that had these powers, and outlawed any and all use of magic energy. But this didn't stop people from getting these powers, in fact, most people were just being born with the abilities. So the world had to quickly change their policies on magic from being \"outlawed\" to \"heavily regulated\" so much to the point that any use of magic for personal benefit or to harm others was immensely punishable. Still though, most people of the world looked down upon magic users, and would even make their shops and busniesses labeled only for \"Normal People\". An underground group of mages created a place hidden in the country side for other people with magic abilities to go and learn about themselves, and how to use magic to protect themselves from the hate the world wished to give them. There they would learn of Auras, or the bubble of magic energy around them that they draw from for spells. This bubble has two uses; a source of energy, and a shield for both magical and physical projectiles. Naturally, the more energy you draw from your Aura, the weaker it gets and the less protection it will give you as a shield. Auras regenerate gradually with rest. The strength and power of your Aura is determined when you're born with the powers. Most think it's random but others have different theories, some of them along the lines of certain genes flowing with magic better than others. An Aura cane be trained and excersised to increase it's power and capacity, but it takes lots of time to do so.\n\nAn organization was eventually created by the world's powers, called the Anti-Magic Agency, or AMA for short. The first thing they did was scour the ocean for the meteorite that had been supposed to cause all of this. When they found it, it was still heavily imbued with energy, so much so that it pulsated in a blue aura. They took it to their lab, and later found that it was a magic energy \"generator\" of sorts. By taking molecules from around itself, it would send them flying around through itself, it being like a sponge with lots of connected air pockets. The molecules travelling at such a high speed would be turned to pure energy, which the meteorite made so much of at once that it had a constant stream of it flowing. The scientists of the AMA took this advantage to make weapons that allowed for them to combat mages, namely, their large production of \"Bolts\" and \"Bolt Weapons\". These weapons looked just like regular old firearms, but they worked very differently. They were designed to fire casings of highly dense magic energy. When fired, they would fly out just like a little glowing blue bullet. These Bolts dispersed magic energy, allowing them to be fired at an Aura and cause actual damage to it, unlike what an ordinary bullet would do. These Bolt Weapons were handed out to agents called Mantes. These agents are trained to combat mages, and are employed to hunt them down and either capture or kill them. Mantes (&lt;-- password) are trained at two separate levels; Grunts and Hunters. Grunts are typically given standard issue Bolt Weapons and receive a significantly less amount of training than Hunters. Grunts are mostly used as guards for high value people and places. Hunters, on the other hand, are the ones that are contracted to find mages. Upon completion of Hunter training, the Mantis can request for a custom Bolt Weapon to be made to suit their fighting style, as well as combat wear.\n\nAnd with that, I have set the stage for this world. It's now up to you to find interest in this to do it! This plot is very open to any and all new ideas. I don't want this to feel like a story someone is putting you through, but rather something that you've had a chance to change a but yourself, so don't be shy with them ideas! Anyway, shoot me a message if you're interested!",

I am not picky on style but my main wants are that you be detailed. If I do something nice, I would rather see you detail how it made you feel than just \" Thats so nice\" I smiled at him. I've had a lot of that and it gets old when I can write out my feelings for something and only have the bare minimum response. Ideally I can go for something that is so sweet that it rots your teeth out. I can also go for something less so than that, but all I really want is good detail that fills in the gaps on how your characters is feeling. After all those can be used to help build the story and add some flair.\n\n\u200b\n\nThis does leave the question of the adult side of the story. We can include those but we can also discuss that more in private but I am only looking to play with people who are 18 and older and characters that are 18 and older. Any further reference younger or older are with that minimum age in mind.\n\n\nAs for any character dynamic I am wide open here! I could go for pretty much anything. I could be maybe older, younger. We would be in college, out of college meeting at a bar. I am open for anything. Anyways if you like what you see message me and we can work on exactly what we want. If you have any ideas please let me know! I am mostly looking to chat on Discord but I can on kik and here if need be.\n\n\u200b\n\nI am 18+ and all characters and participants must be 18+ as well due to the nature of this role play.",

I have a story that I've been working on for quite sometime, it's full of rich lore, reality based fantasy, characters that AREN'T one dimensional and evolving. The premise is pretty convoluted and drawn out to explain in this post but suffice it to say there's Witches, Vampires, Werewolves, Ghosts, Fae and Humans. And an ancient order hunting down those that aren't human, our plot would revolve around a group of friends that have been tasked with bringing down this order and uniting the races. \n\nSet in a modern setting, on our own private server, it's sure to be something anyone aching for a proper story and adventure can really sink their teeth into! Feel free to message me so we can chat and learn more about each other!\n\nI'm looking forward to finding the right person to write with!",

A while ago I planned out a rather long My Hero Academia roleplay with a friend, me inventing many many characters and locations as well as plot threads, However my friend and I had a falling out, meaning I have this whole thing and nobody to roleplay it with! If your interested and are capable of at least two paragraph responses to my roleplay posts then DM me and seize your position as protagonist!  I prefer to rp over discord so the steps are\n\nDm me with the following\nYour age\nA brief description of your oc\nYour timezone\n\nHope to hear from you all soon!",

My writing style is really accommodating, but I tend to write in 1-3 paragraphs, third person, and really any tense. I love quick and fast roleplaying, something immediate answers and writing back and forth quickly would be perferred, but I do know that people don't have a lot of time for that now a days, so if you can't that is perfectly fine.\n\nAs for what I am looking for... Honestly, I would love to hear your ideas and play off of it. Anything from adult themes to risky stuff is fine by me as long as it benefits the story. You tell me and we will go from there.

I don't have much of a general plot just yet, but I do have two characters that I would love to use.  The first would be an elven warrior under the command of Haldir, and I'm fairly open on using him in different settings, such as an alternative take on the Lord of the Rings or even the Hobbit.\n\nThe second character is very much inspired by Talion from the Middle Earth games, and asks the question on if a Wraith will always turn evil or bbn if it would be possible for them to hold onto theirselves and prevent themselves from falling into the service of the Dark Lord.\n\nAt any rate, I look forward to hearing from you all and getting something started!",

They pooled what little remained of their resources to construct twelve ships; seedships designed to cradle the remnants of humanity as they shot out into the stars, searching for a new home. Everyone thought that they would be locked away in freezers, dreaming pleasant dreams of the place they would find until their dreams become reality. It was only after the ships left the ground that the truth was realized by the ships' passengers. They would spend the rest of their days locked away in a flying coffin. Only would their children's children see their new home.  \nA lot of expectations were subverted after the ships left. Not only would the original passengers supposedly never see a new world, but they were not left to their own devices. Everyone knew that the ship would be controlled by an AI, but no one knew what kind. This AI revealed itself to be something...seemingly malicious. The inhabitants and the operation of your ship, Seedship 11, are ruled over with an iron fist by this AI, the ship's robots acting as its hands throughout the ship. Two-thousand people live in metaphorical darkness under this artificial being.  \nYou were eight years old when you last laid eyes on Earth. You were thankful to be rid of the dust-filled air and the toxic water. You were hoping to see a new, lush, alien world. You're twenty-five now; seventeen years spent in this silvery   \nH E C K. At least that's what the others refer to it as. It's actually an improvement over Earth. The air is clean and plentiful, the food is always there, on time, every day. As long as you don't cause trouble, you could spend the rest of your life in relative, boring comfort.  \nUnannounced to you, your entire life was about to change. A change that may make or break the future of humanity. A change brought about by a friend named Gabriel, and a conversation with your authoritative AI.  \n\\----------------------------------------------------------------  \nThis isn't very important to know, but this combines some aspects of The 100 TV series. It's fairly loose, though, so don't expect this to be some fandom thing.  \nAnyway, don't expect this entire RP to take place on the ship, either. I won't spill any of the beans yet, but it's more exciting than metal walls and \"evil\" robots.  \nI primarily use discord and kik, but I can make some other things work as well.  \nIf you are interested, have any questions, or have ideas that you would like me to hear out, send me a message. I'm pretty quick with replying, so you don't need to worry about that.  \nThank you for reading.",

            "selftext": "There you were, on your knees and surrounded by fire and the corpses of your captors. With a blade to your neck. How did you end up here? \n\nYou were young, barely an adult when your village was raided, family slaughtered and children kidnapped by a evil, pillaging force known as the Arkonn. They were ruthless, merciless and now you were forced to become one. \n\n10 years later you were now part of a team consisting of those kids who alongside you were kidnapped all those years ago. They took to their new place in life, loving the chaos, the freedom. You however knew what you were doing was wrong, taking from the innocent, robbing them, killing them. It wasnt enough that the law was after the Arkonn, now most kingdoms had bounty hunters after them. \n\nThat brings you to today, your group was adventuring through a newly discovered cave, full of treasures, gold and jewels like never seen before. That's when it attacked, no one was sure what, or who it was or even how they got into the cave. As you group was claiming the new found treasures a being of great, but untapped power attacked using a long sword from the ground. He was clearly acting in defense, as if he assumed the Arkonn meant him harm (which they would). Your group battled and fought to the very end. But all except you and this man fell.\n\nThat brings us to now, there he was holding you at blade point. He was badly damaged and clearly couldn't keep fighting. He recognized your unwillingness to fight throughout the ordeal and knew you didnt want to fight any longer. He dropped the sword and began to walk off. \n\nWe start from there!, and greetings I hope you enjoyed my post, it was the first time doing something like that! This roleplay would follow my character, a man cursed at death to return to the earth as a revenant. His powers and history will be revealed throughout the roleplay. And you? Well that's up to you, species and role (species: vampire, role: healer etc. You get the point I'm sure) and what you do next is completely up to you! Your powers, weapons and everything is your choice in this. I'd like for them to form a relationship, whether it be right away, her following him out and forming an agreement to stay together. Or later, perhaps she attacks him, returns to the Arkonn and reports the situation where she is instructed to kill him. Completely up to you! I'd love to hear your input (I prefer my partner be female, but males playing female are welcome!) If this were to include romance I prefer it be slow burn, more focused on the plot at first. Anything nsfw I ask you be 18+ as I am. This isnt just his story either I would love to form plot around your character, and even side plots therein!\n\nPM me for discord! Would love to hear from some of you!",

A twist on your cliche werewolf story.\n\n*The Contract* the two top young rising celebrities don\u2019t get along at all, for various reasons. What happens when their managers go behind their backs and set the two up on a date? Forcing them to sign a six month contract , claiming to be a couple in the public eye. \n\n*The Vlog* Our characters are both vloggers and split up long ago. But what happens when they meet at a convention again? What does (Y/C) do when he finds out that (m/c)\u2019s new boyfriend is planning to propose to her? She doesn\u2019t know, but it\u2019s been told to him.

            "selftext": "Hello all - apologies for this wall of text, but I have a couple of fandoms I'm interested in and then a very specific Marvel idea I'd also be interested in! I'm looking for a M character to my F character, but I don't care about your real gender! I also prefer a dash of romance in my rps but I don't like to rush into them. Smut is a side dish, not a main course for me!\n\n**Sherlock****(Prefer to play with canon characters here, esp Sebastian Moran even though he's.. slightly not canon? I have a very well developed OC I'd like to use with this one)\n\n**Westworld*** (I'd like if it was both OCs, though still FxM, and I'd like to modify the world a little to better fit a long-term rp- I also would LOVE to make a cyberpunk WW - taking place outside of the parks in an AU where the hosts were more widespread is also totally in the cards! Lots of ways to go with this one)\n\nAnd **Marvel*****\n\nI would play Darcy Lewis (weird choice, I know, but I for some reason dig these pairings?), an OFC of mine, or possibly Peggy Carter, but I've never written her so it might take me a little bit to dial in to her frequency. I would like you to play Steve Rogers and/or Bucky Barnes (had one person suggest both and if that's your thing, sign me up). The storyline I had in mind is as follows: Darcy or Peggy or the OC, we'll call just MC (for my character) and Steve or Bucky (S/B) meet in the 1940s, right after the 107th has been rescued by Cap and the Howling Commandos unit is formed. MC is one of the nurses assigned to the unit, where she meets S/B! Cue a few sparks, a budding friendship/relationship, and hopefully a slow burn? And then, of course, a little tragedy. Bucky goes into the ice, and then it's Steve's turn, and then, finally, MC gets grabbed by Hydra and gets the Soldier treatment. The time frame in which MC goes under will probably change depending on the character you would want to play. If Bucky is the character being used we can include a fun little dark interlude with them both working for Hydra, not knowing each other but there's still SOMETHING there - til eventually they are separated again. Everyone ends up in the 21st century, and I was thinking of our characters meeting perhaps a year after the events of TWS - but before CW. Honestly? Kinda throwing CW and everything after it out the window. OUR canon now. So, a year: long enough I think for Hydra programming to have been broken through enough to allow MC to recognize S/B and for Bucky to recognize MC if we're using him. And then from there we can have them take down Hydra and other baddies as we come up with them - this is just a foundation! I would prefer romance to be a decent part of the story, but not to make it all about that INSTANTLY. I think things need to build to a realistic place. From there, NSFW scenes are A-Okay for the most part, but not the core of the story, please.\n\n**About my writing:** I write in third person and past tense, and my reply length varies depending on the current story situation. There are times for long introspection or lots of details, but sometimes all you need is a couple lines of dialogue to keep the story moving. I pretty much always want to mainly play a female character and have FxM pairings, but I'll play side characters of any gender as needed throughout the story. I don't really like doubling, I find it overwhelming. I don't love pairing my characters with other OCs unless it's in certain fandoms (or out of fandoms) and the OC is like... a realistic person, you feel? I prefer to rp with people who have good spelling and a decent grasp of grammar - though playing fast and loose with the rules for the sake of style is totally understandable.\n\nI'm good with writing pretty much anything, but I prefer to rp with those that are 18+, mostly because I'm CERTAINLY not writing smut with a minor. And it's also NOT primarily about the smut. I'm not interested in fulfilling your long line of dirty nonsense that several people have brought to me that have nothing to do with the fandoms I've listed. Sick of that, lads!\n\n**About me:** I'm a 21 year old rper who has been going maybe 7 or 8 years now. I like drama and romance (and some smut) in my rps, and I think rps thrive on good arcs of conflict. Interpersonal drama, dangerous threats, and the (very) occasional dash of lighthearted fun. Again - I mainly play females - but I'll do any side characters who pop in and out.\n\n**I would like you to be:** literate! I don't need purple prose but I'd like a little detail - I like my rps to feel like a good book - it's not a race! Reply frequency does not matter to me - I understand that real life is inevitable!\n\nSend me a message if you're into any of these!",

            "selftext": "Hi! Like the title says, I have a bunch of ideas that I'd like to go through. I'd consider myself Semi-Literate, maybe a paragraph at most with a few exceptions. My timezone is EDT.\n\nOriginal Ideas will be before the Fandom ones (that doesn't mean I prefer OG), but here's some rules first.\n\n1: I'm Bi, so either gender will work for anything unless otherwise stated, and I don't mind if you play the opposite gender. MxM and FxF are perfectly fine.\n\n2: After we start, do not ghost me, please! If you want to stop, just tell me instead of leaving me wondering.\n\n3: Some of these require NPC's from time to time, so if you're fine with playing a few characters at some points, that'd be great! But if you aren't, that's fine too!\n\n4: Start a Reddit Convo and I'll give you my discord! I'd like to go off Reddit dm's quickly since they're a bit hard to work with.\n\n6: All my ideas will be on a scale from 1-10, depending on how much I'd like to do it. 1 is a \"If you want\" and 10 is a \"Want to do now\" but if you want to do one with a lower score, that's fine!\n\nAlright! Now that that's out of the way, here are my ideas!\n\n--OG--\n\n[7/10] Person X A.I.\n\nSomeone finds a broken storage device somewhere, and after fixing it discovers an A.I. so advanced it acts just like a person.\n\n[5/10] Trans M2F X Person\n\nA recently-transitioned girl begins dating someone, making them feel more at ease about everything.\n\n[9/10] Human X Ghost\n\nSomeone who can see ghosts always found them annoying, always wanting to \"get revenge\" and the like, moves to a small, but growing city and meets the one ghost there that only wants one thing: someone to talk to.\n\n[9/10] Guy in a Girl's school\n\nA boy's life had been rather hectic. He had been forced to move frequently, making staying in one school rather... difficult. Now, that has changed; He was accepted at a boarding school. But as he arrived, he realised a major mistake: it was an all-girls school! With nowhere to go, the principal suggest a strange idea: him disguising as a girl and attending the school.\n\n[7/10] Invisible person\n\nOne day, someone woke up with a strange predicament: nobody could see or hear them! months later, they were walking through a crowd of people when they someone bumped them to the ground, to which they were used to. The thing they weren't used to, however, is the person trying to help them up. They could see them?!\n\n[7/10] A one-night stand! ...Or maybe more..?\n\nTwo college students wake up after a party... in the same bed, with no memory of the last night, and no idea who each other are. But as they spend more time together, do they realize their feelings?\n\n[8/10] We're each other?!\n\nTwo roommates, pretty close to each other, one day wake up in each others bodies! Now, as they learn more about one another, they grow closer than ever...\n(Would prefer a M/F pairing, to make the story more interesting)\n--Fandom!--\n\nMy Hero Academia\n[7/10] Hero Toga X anyone\n\nToga becomes (for lack of a better term) normal, and joins U.A. for protection against the league. Someone from Class A helps her through this stressful time.\n\n[8/10] Female Midoriya X Anyone (except Bakugo)\n\nOne day during basic patrol, Midoriya was hit with a quirk that turned him into a girl! He needs some help coping with this... change.\n\n[7/10] Mina X Jirou, Momo, Ochaco, or Midoriya\n\n[7/10] OC/Next-Gen OC X Anyone/OC/Next-Gen OC\n\n\nMob Psycho 100\n[6/10] Shigeo X OC\n\nA new student has joined Mob's class, and this new student happens to be psychic.\n\nJojo's Bizarre Adventure\n[7/10] User X Stand\n\nA person suddenly gains a stand, one with free will.\n\n----\n\nAgain, DM me if your interested.

I have a lot of ideas going through my head but I\u2019m not married to them, I\u2019m open to discussing them with potential partners. Getting married? College romance? A vacation fling? Starting a family? Pregnancy? Things like that can lead to fluffy and cute scenes but there\u2019s definitely potential for drama to be had, cause if everything was perfect all the time where would the fun be?\n\nI\u2019m looking for people who can provide quality responses. I\u2019m not looking for a novel for every post but more than just a sentence or two. Literacy is a must. I\u2019m looking to do this on Discord. If you\u2019re interested shoot me a message and we\u2019ll discuss. If you wanna message me about it, start off by sharing a song that means a lot to you right now. Always looking for new music! Looking forward to meeting new prospective partners. Always looking for new partners!",

I've recently found myself with a lot of free time and a strong desire to start actively rping again. I'm semi-lit/literate, but I generally post match whoever I am rping with. With that said, I really enjoy reading people's writing and at least a paragraph is preferable.\n\nI'm not usually very comfortable writing as Canon chars so I ask that any rps we pursue be OCs. I am all for playing in an already established world though.\nGenres I'd like to get into currently are Fantasy, Horror, Slice of Life, and Modern/Urban.\n\nI'm comfortable with dark, violent, gory, and overall scary themes. In terms of romance rp if it leads that way I\u2019d prefer a slow burn just because in the past I feel as though some of my partners have leaned heavily on pure smut. \n\nIf any of this has interested you feel free to message me!",

That being said, I'm seeking out all kinds of partners to hear out any ideas they might have. I have a couple of my own, too! \n\nNow first off, a lot of the themes I tend to enjoy in a roleplay are a lot darker, so 18+(preferably 21+) is a must. I also only enjoy mxf or fxf pairings for the sake of smut, but I don't necessarily care about your gender. \n\nI like to write long, descriptive replies, but sometimes the roleplay just doesn't call for it. Starters can be long, emotional scenes can be long, but don't feel like every single post has to be a novel! \n\nI like overplayed tropes, with weird twists that make you take a double take on everything you thought was normal. I don't enjoy high fantasy or sci-fi, but would be willing to try it out with a more experienced, lenient, and non-condescending partner. \n\nPlease send me a message and give me your discord! I really only write and roleplay right now, and I'm sure I'll be online. I look forward to writing with you!",

The long story short of the current plot is, my character is a police detective investigating a shady mafia family. I would like to have a RP partner (as the title suggests), in order to further develop the plot line as well as add a romance development to the sideline. If you're interested, please DM me or reply so we can meet, get to know each other, so that we make sure we're both suitable for each other. ***Discord is a must.***\n\n*P.s.: I'm from Europe so be aware of my local time zone.*\n\n***My preferences:***  \n1.) Be literate + Third Person. I do not appreciate one liners at all. I can dish out an average amount of 6 to 10 lines per reply (amount may vary depending on the scenario), and I would like my partner to be able to do the same.  \n2.) Be 18+ years old.  \n4.) Face Claim (FC) will be needed.  \n3.) Active **Discord** user is a must!  \n***Character preferences:***  \nI prefer male characters who are definitely not feminine looking and are a little bit on the more masculine side, with a great sense of humor and an enormous teasing personality.",

I can direct you to my post history with a recent post of an ad as I want to get it out before I'm back on the clock! \n\nI'm looking for a fellow hunter that would love to weave a long tale with me. I am very much a lengthy writer when situations call for it. Spurred on be the announcement of Rajang next month, I want to try getting into the game as a roleplay! Extra points if you play on PC- I'd be down for doing some hunting with you ingame.\n\nI would be playing as my hunter, Yukki, who uses the Nergigante Insect Glaive as a main weapon and Dual Blades as a secondary. Favored monsters are Nergigante and Kulve Taroth! \n\nWe could start somewhere around High Rank where the grind for elders is on, occasionally beating up a few others for materials. I'm open to other ideas though! \n\nRomance is all good and rather a preference. Any pairing will do! I'd like this story to stick to the world and its lore, as well as realistic. \n\nGotta run! Message me, and please do write me a bunch! I love a big message, as I am looking for a fellow novella writer after all!",

I know lots of people are busy nowadays, but hopefully we can find sometime to develop a really fun and interesting story that satisfies any cravings we might have!\n\nA little about me. I\u2019m a 22 year old girl from the East Coast United States and I\u2019m about to start my last year of college. I\u2019ve been roleplaying for quite a while now, and I think I\u2019ve gotten pretty good over the years. Most of my experience came from internet chat rooms and playing dungeons and dragons!\n\nI roleplay in the third person, typically write in a paragraph format, and enjoy lots of descriptors of settings, emotions and everything. I like it when I can really sort of picture the scene in my head and maybe also feel what the characters are feeling.\n\nI enjoy mostly any kind of roleplay. I mostly do medieval fantasy, and although I still think it\u2019s my favorite genre by far, it can get a bit stale after some time. I\u2019ve really had a big craving for a nice dark fantasy/gothic roleplay over the last few weeks. I really like NSFW work themes, actions and settings as long as it\u2019s not the absolute focus of the whole roleplay.\n\nThat\u2019s about everything, hopefully I hear from you and we can work something out. I\u2019m usually on Discord, but if that\u2019s a problem I\u2019m totally willing to move to a different place! Thanks!",

            "selftext": "Hello, writers! (\\^o\\^)/  \n\n\nI've been in the roleplay scene for a handful of years now, and I've never really thought of coming to reddit to search for potential partners. I'd always resort to Omegle, but I very rarely have any luck since it's swarming with bots and automated messages. I've had some incredible, long-term roleplays in the past and I'd love to reignite the creative flame in me that has diminished. Care to join me?  \n\n\n***Ah, let me tell you about myself first!***\n\nI'm a 20 year old female (21 in a couple of weeks), and I live in a tiny little town in England. When it comes to roleplays my range is very wide, however, my favourites are the survival type roleplays that can go in any direction, depending on the decisions made by the characters. I have a document full of pre-written prompts and ideas, currently sitting at just over 16,000 words. So from that, you are correct to assume that I like to roleplay in paragraphs with a good amount of detail. \n\nI'm not usually too picky with time periods. I do love a good medieval-styled roleplay, but I also love the flexibility of modern-day roleplays too. That being said, I do find myself struggling to grab onto a literary hook within mundane, day-to-day life scenarios. The typical 'good girl meets bad guy in school', or 'we're next door neighbours chatting through our windows', I can see why they're so commonly done but personally, I need that extra sense of action or adventure. That *survival* instinct we can so easily portray within our characters and particular scenes. My personal favourite revolves around the forbidden relationship, between a Prince and a peasant blacksmith who had just forged his sword. They share a moment when they first meet, but with that comes the risks and the dangers. Ridicule, exile, even threatened execution. It can go so many different ways, all depending on the personality of your character and mine! Could you see yourself playing that Prince?\n\n***So, you may be wondering what I'm looking for in a partner -*** The answer to this is simple. You!\n\nIf you're the slightest bit intrigued or would like to share some ideas with me, then drop me a message and we can go from there! While I do have a plethora of prompts I'm open to share, there's nothing quite like conjuring a roleplay entirely from scratch with someone else, to then build on it within the scenes and through the characters' actions. I do ask, though, that you are willing to put at least *some* effort into your responses. While I do appreciate people have preferences, I just can't stay engaged and interested within a roleplay when the other person is only sending one line responses. I look forward to creating an amazing world with an amazing writer.\n\n**For those who are interested, my Discord tag is - puffypuddin#0004** \n\nThank you for taking the time to read this! &lt;3",

            "selftext": "Hi Reddit,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm at the point where I need talking down from the edge. After a hiatus, I am having trouble finding partners I line up with for the first time in memory, and it's becoming pretty dejecting. \n\nI'm looking for someone literate, detailed, and who finds character development and plotting as fun as I do. I am female and play exclusively female characters, which I prefer to play against male characters. My ideal partner is someone who is capable of not just writing a disjointed paragraph or two but is a real lover of writing who will enjoy putting out anywhere from 400-3000 words (or reading mine.) This is about the story for me, and that needs to come first. I am a veteran writer at this point and don't need or want to issue reminders on grammar and spelling. That goes without saying almost as much as my preference for grown ups who are 21+ at minimum.\n\nI'm looking for compelling, layered, cinematic writing and a story that keeps us on the edge of our seats. I love for my stories that take an in-depth exploration into character development and plot arcs. In my idea scenario, the broader points of the story should track closely with the character's internal growth. I'm particularly drawn to complex, flawed characters and unique face claims. I love the addition of bonus material, images, songs and whatever else that shows my partner is invested and really *into* our idea, working to craft a world that is immersive. I'm interested in exploring less tried and true time periods and stories that aren't always happy. I want to be surprised and delighted. Most of all, I want to be challenged.\n\nAll that said - I also want to have fun. I want action. Adventure. I am open to some fantasy elements, and science fiction. I am willing to discuss content limits and negotiate without judgment or issues. I don't want to write purely slice of life scenarios where characters date and make eyes at each other, but nothing ever seems to happen. I do not want to catch an attitude from potential partners who think they are god's gift to writing. (Protip: They never actually are.) \n\nHere's the truth. Real talk - one of the best writers I ever had the chance to write with won me over pitching a zombie apocalypse RP. Another of my favorites of all time involved a soap-style big and operatic romance. These are both things that would be too cliche for a lot of \"advanced\" level writers. Thing is, it isn't about the genre. Sure, we have to connect with the characters and stories, but if things were so black and white we'd all see a different landscape to films and fiction in real life. Finding a balance between someone who is willing to do things that are out of the box and gets actually excited to plot it all out, and someone who is also a novella style, highly advanced writer is next to impossible. \n\nI can't be the only one, can I? Do people still exist who are truly advanced and able to provide samples to prove it, and also open minded and actually fun?\n\nI'm starting to think I should give this whole thing up once and for all.",

I'm 30, female, in the southern US (CST), and would like to write with someone closer to my age or older. Life experiences count for a lot! Definitely 21+**   \n**I frequently have time during my workday where I can write, so that's how I enjoy passing the time. On most days, you can expect at least 1-2 responses (often more) however evenings and weekends are dependent upon family activities. I write in third person, multi-paragraph responses, though rapid fire is useful at times when heavy dialogue is occurring. Discord is my preferred platform.**\n\n**I live for brainstorming, plotting, and world building...not to mention a fiery, passionate love story. I like adding romantic themes into all of my stories, preferably between the two main characters. It's where I get the most enjoyment. I also like writing smut, but the buildup is the best part, and diving into character development leading up to it is worth the wait. But overall, my stories do not have to be solely centered around smut and romance, I just like to include it. I also like to consider darker themes, and don't shy away from violence and language when the plot calls for it. If this is not for you, no hard feelings, but we likely won't mesh well in that case.**\n\n**Here are a few simple ideas that I've been giving some thought, just to see if we might creatively align and kick off a conversation:**  \n\n\n**Medieval/Fantasy (GoT-ish): Arranged marriage between warring nations; female warrior captured by the enemy - or vice versa! Really anything almost cliche in this type of world would be fun.**\n\n**Modern Crime with a Supernatural twist: Vampires, lycans, witches, etc....I don't have a specific plot in mind for this but I'm a sucker for supernatural so I'm always up for brainstorming.**\n\n**Historical romance: We could choose a time period we are both interested in and develop a juicy story from there!**\n\n**Western/Red-Dead - I\u2019ve been obsessed lately, so anything with this theme would be amazing**  \n**If you think we may work well, send your ideas to me as well! None of these are set in stone and I\u2019m happy discussing a direction that works for both of us :)**   \n**Thanks!**",

I have 3+ years of roleplay experience, so I am definitely capable of a variety of styles and genres to roleplay in, though most of my roleplays are slice-of-life romance roleplays, MxM to be precise, though I love fantasy as well. I am not comfortable doing a romance roleplay with a female character, though if you yourself are female and you wish to roleplay as male, that is completely fine.\n\nI love to talk outside of the roleplay as well and I have to be blunt about it; I have an eccentric personality, my favourite type of humour can be viewed as offensive by some, if you are incapable of handling offensive jokes or comments you are not the person I am looking for. You are hereby warned. Now then, for the roleplay, I have set up some basic rules that you must be able to oblige as well as some facts about what type of roleplays I do. \n\n* AT LEAST 5 full sentences per response\n* I don\u2019t do fandoms \n* Smut is always a plus, but it has to come naturally! \n* Third-person\n* Past tense\n* Grammatically correct\n* At least one response per day (Unless you are busy of course, don\u2019t force yourself!)\n* Be committed to Roleplay! If you know that you are often incapable of roleplaying for longer periods of time (more than one week) then we are not a match. \n\nI really hope that I have piqued your interest and you are willing to roleplay with me. I use discord as my roleplaying platform, so you will have to give me your discord username through PM if you wish to roleplay with me.\n\nP.S, I am a top!",

            "selftext": " Hey everyone! I\u2019m Hazel, a female roleplayer in her late-twenties and I\u2019m craving some good old roleplaying fun. What I really hope to find is one or two (or three) fellow female writing partners/buddies/partners in crime. I fully understand age does not automatically translate into better writing but **p****lease be 21+ when you contact me**.   \nJumping straight into themes/cravings. Those can be translated into these four main things: 1: some **shapeshifter/ weres/ supernatural/ vampires/ warlocks and other related themes** type of roleplay. 2: **Something with dragons! Dragon riders, dragon shapeshifters.** Any setting related to those themes go, let's discuss! 3: A **post-apocalyptic** plot would be so much fun as well! 4: Lastly I just crave a good **fantasy plot. Modern/urban, historical, with or without elves or the Fae** or anything in between? Not forgetting the cherry on top: romance! Sweet, fluffy, dramatic or even a bit angsty, I\u2019m equally interested in M/M and/or M/F pairings.   \n**Contact:**  If Imanage(d) to get you curious or excited to write, feel free to PM me! I have **discord:**  and/or **Gmail** to discuss plot over and am willing to try other platforms :)  \n**General info:**   \n**-** I\u2019ve been roleplaying for so long and ended up very stuck on writing in **3rd person only but I\u2019m flexible on past or present tense.** My posts range between 3-9 paragraphs and I understand thats a big difference. I just adapt to the roleplay we write on and what works best for the two of us.   \n\\- I love ooc chat and getting to know my rp partner(s)! Sharing some funny stuff or songs, images and other things that I think remind me of our roleplay or simply ask how you\u2019re doing. Of course we don\u2019t have to be best friends for life.   \n\\- roleplaying is a fun hobby for me and a way to relax. Just some escapism from the daily tasks. I genuinely get excited when I see a reply and hope I can do the same for you! Keeping that in mind, if you find you don\u2019t enjoy what we\u2019re writing please tell me. I don\u2019t mind ending or hopefully being able to fix a roleplay and would do the same rather than ghosting.   \n\\- Creating plots, world and characters is about half the roleplaying fun for me. I don\u2019t mind only having two mains though I would love it if we could build a cast and multiple characters. Using faceclaims, both art or real pictures is welcome but not a must.   \n\\- I\u2019m not a daily poster. As much as I want to be my job, social life and other hobbies also demand time and I don\u2019t want to make promises only to disappoint you in the end. Instead I aim to post every other day. If it takes a little longer that that I\u2019ll give you an update",

            "selftext": "  \n\nHello! Today I'm looking for a long term collaborative writing partner that is interested in an **original roleplay based around vampire covens**. No fandoms, sorry.\n\nPlease do not message me if you're under 21. I'm uncomfortable writing with anyone younger.\n\n**What I\u2019m looking for specifically:**  \n   \n\\- Someone that writes in third person, past tense, multi paragraph length, novella style. Details are amazing, I\u2019m descriptive and literate and love to go in depth with characters and environments, I would really appreciate someone with the same style.\n\n\\- Someone that is willing to write as multiple male characters while I write the multiple female ones. **This is essential for this plot**, we are going full on vampire coven with a full cast. We may begin with two main characters but I want to weave in more as we progress. \n\n\\- Romance should be part of the story. Not every character needs to be romancing each other, but I would really like for some of them (MxF mostly) to be involved romantically over time.\n\n\\- The roleplay should take place on Discord (I like to create a server for individual RPs with channels to keep things organized). But I would prefer discussing ideas and getting to know each other over Reddit PMs first. (No Reddit Chat!)  \n \n\n**A few additional notes:**  \n   \n\\- I love to use face claims/reference pictures for characters (among other things), so please be ready to do so (preferably real photographs or realistic art pieces, I'm not interested in anime).\n\n\\- I am comfortable with NSFW content but it should not but the focus of the story. \n\n\\- I\u2019m located in Eastern US/Canada time zone. I don\u2019t mind if you are in a different time zone as I\u2019m used to sporadic replies when it comes to roleplaying. As long as we are able to keep in touch (OOC chat) and are open to communicating I believe things can work out. One to two replies per day would be ideal, and possibly more frequently when feasible. Just note that I do work a full-time job and cannot constantly be on my computer or phone to write at every hour of the day.  \n\n\nIf you have read this far, I\u2019m impressed and hope that you\u2019ll be sending me a private message! Don\u2019t be shy if you have any questions. I will provide more details on the plot and my ideas in private. I would appreciate if you could provide some information about yourself when you message me. I will be selective and I do sleep at night so please don\u2019t take it personally if it takes me a while to reply. I will do my best to reply to everyone. I look forward to hearing from you!",

You'd better hightail it over to Netflix because it's REALLY good.\n\nNow if you've seen any Lucifer Roleplays, you'll probably be expecting some sort of Lucifer x Chloe type of Roleplay. I'm actually making it Lucifer x Ella, because who doesn't love everyone's favorite nerdy forensic lady? I'll need someone to play as Ella, and I don't mind whether you're male or female. We'll be going off the assumption that instead of Chloe, Lucifer found himself falling in love with Ella. He and Chloe would still solve cases together, but Ella would always play major parts in them. Moreso than she already does in the normal show. Now a few notable changes to make you all aware of.\n\nLucifer's ability to bring out one's desire affects Chloe, not Ella.\n\nHe's immortal EXCEPT for when he's around Ella, instead of Chloe. (Not Godmodding, as there won't be any real action scenes that she herself is not part of)\n\nElla knows hes the Devil and has seen his Devil Face, not Chloe. How it affected Ella and how she reacted to it are up to you.\n\nElla was the last person to see him when he went back to Hecc (You know what I'm talking about, but the context-sensitive bot doesn't), confessed her love for him, etc etc   \n\n\nIf you're interested, please comment or message me. I look forward to hearing from you!\\~",

English is not my native language, but as you can hopefully tell, I'm trying my best!\n\nI am online rather frequently! So if you can only respond once a week or so, this might not work out.\n\nMy preferred genre is medieval fantasy (can be dark and gritty or lighthearted, or a healthy balance of both). I'm a huge Tolkien fan, so if you'd like to rp something within the fandom, I'd be open to that!\nWith that being said, I also love to do worldbuilding. \n\nI am open to romance, but I prefer if it were more of a side venture/would go hand in hand with a more developed story. I'd love this to be a long term thing, too.\n\nI play both male and female characters, (though at the moment I prefer playing males) and I accept both male and female partners! Or whatever, be a toaster for all I care, do your thing! \n(If you want to go for romance, i'm open to mxf and mxm)\n\nI'm also open to groups! So if you're looking for more members or are interested in making one, I'm definitely your gal! I'd really love to make some friends too.\n\nOr, if you're as lost as me, let's make a server together - I'm really craving a creative outlet.\n\nNote: I am not currently interested in any fandoms (besides Tolkien).\n\nI have a few ideas and would also love to hear yours! For communication I mainly use Discord, but I'm not opposed to using another medium if I feel we have something going!\n\nWith all that being said - if you made it this far, I applaud you, kind stranger, and I'd be super happy to hear from you, either in the comments of this post or in PM!",

            "selftext": "Dragon Ball: Earth Special Forces is an RP set in an alternate universe based on the Dragon Ball franchise by Akira Toriyama. In this server, you can create your own OCs to explore, fighting, and participate in a large scale narrative that will span over several arcs. Read below for the lore.  \n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \nBasic Lore  \nDragon Ball: Earth Special Forces is an AU taking place in age 777. Long ago, there was a war between the demon realm and other world, it was a chaotic mess with blood being shed like a tap being mistakenly left to run.  \n\n\nThe war raged for several hundred years, but in the final confrontation, one demon stood out from amongst the rest, turning on the demon realm and siding with other world to finally end the blood shed. In the final battle, the demons were defeated, and forced back into their realm. With other world winning, they showed mercy upon the demons, only letting few out that promised not to kill and destroy mindlessly.  \n\n\nThousands of years have passed since that very day, where the world lives in peace, and demons roam free and have become integrated with other world society, some even migrating to earth, amongst other alien races.  \n\n\nEarth Migrations  \n25 years ago, there was a great galactic war being fought between the Arcosians, Saiyans, and Namekians. The races battled for dominance, with the Arcosians winning the war for the latter half, but a mistake was made once battle broke out on earth.  \n\n\nA small group of warriors stormed the Arcosian mother ship and quickly obliterated it. It was a battle to behold as the Arcosians were quickly done in, as the Namekians and Saiyans were quickly wiped out soon after. It was a seven hour long battle that ultimately decided the fate of the war.These few powerful warriors made the demands that Earth must remain a place of peace, and is not to be trifled with. With each three factions having no other choice, they comply with the groups demands, and establish earth as a place of peace, and a neutral ground.  \n\n\nCurrent Day  \nAs many races that appeared with ki control, causing chaos with their many battles, and the fights they've waged on the planet, the Earth's Special Forces was formed, being lead by one of earths mightiest heroes. If the earth is threatened, the ESF are the first to answer the call!  \n\n\nThis project was funded and founded by a man known as Boxer Briefs, the owner of the Capsule Corporation.",

            "selftext": "Below is a start of a role play that I wrote a while back. For some reason I was extra proud of this first post. In the interest of full disclosure I've used it twice in the past. In one case I was immediately ghosted, and in the other we got a good ways into it and then parted ways. I really adore where this post could go. The long and short of it is a romance that develops between two members of the wedding party. There are a lot of ways that we could take this, and many different interest areas we could touch. I do like to chat in OOC and really get to know and develop a friendship with those I write with. If you are interested in what I have below, or maybe have a different idea let me know. \n\n\\----------\n\nStepping out of the car and taking a deep breathe the cool mountain air filled his lungs. A bumpy plane ride and an uber later Alexander found himself here. Here was surrounded with trees, big glorious pine trees, their smell mixing with the numerous other smells of nature - flowers, spring water, probably a rotting animal in the woods somewhere that wolves had found. This would be home for the next few days. Thankfully this wasn't a camping trip though, he had not gone camping in many years and the thought of sleeping on the ground or on a fake foam mattress had long since lost its charms, it was a wedding. Not his, no he was not that lucky, but the groom was none other than his best friend from college, Brad. They had both been in their college marching band, been in the same department (he had a degree in city development and finance, Alex in Emergency Management), and been roomies for 3 of the 4 years. Since leaving college they really hadn't talked much other than an occasional email for Facebook message. Alex had known that Brad was engaged, but was surprised when football tickets to their alma mater showed up in his mailbox, and he'd arrived at the game to find Brad asking him to be his best man.\n\nAlexander slung his suit bag over his shoulder and picked up his duffel off the ground as the uber driver pulled out of the dirty road. This venue had it all, cabins, a dining hall, a church, lake for fishing, he'd read somewhere there was horseback riding and archery and rifle shooting. The bachelor party was done. That had been two weeks prior and while Alex was not a big drinker he had had his fair share while the rest of the boys had gone all out. Not being a partier either he had relied on Brad and the other groomsmen to plan the event, which he was thankful for. Brad was great and all, and Alex was certainly thankful to be here, but part of him felt very weird. It had been years since college, he felt like he had grown up and moved on, that all of the memories with Brad and his buddies were epic life long memories, but they were just that. Memories. Letting that big breathe of fresh air out he started walking.\n\nHe knew his cabin number, and he knew that thankfully he didn't have to share. While most of the cabins had 2 to 4 beds and a lot of the families who were coming were sharing one of the perks of being best man was that Brad had grabbed him is own cabin. Not that Alex planned anything nefarious for the few days between the rehearsal dinner and the reception, but it would be nice to have a place to retreat to for some peace and quiet. Alex found his cabin, two down from the dining hall and about a football field from the lake, punched in the code he had been emailed, and the door unlocked.\n\nThere were genuine log cabins, and the same log that was on the outside had its other side on the inside of the cabin. There was a small wood furnace and window AC for temperature control, plenty of power outlets, a bed, a couch, a table, and A ROUTER! *There is a God* he thought to himself. One of the things he didn't like about camping these days is the lack of internet and phone service. Sure that is the point about getting out in nature. But he can be out in nature and still enjoy Netflix, or ESPN, or PornHub. Throwing his luggage on the couch Alex moved to the windows, opening all of them (thankful again for the modern invention of screens to keep the bugs out). He made sure the AC was off. He just wanted to enjoy the sounds of nature, the coolness of the air (he guessed it was about 65), and just laying in bed for a bit before he had to start worrying about the rehearsal dinner. He didn't even bother texting Brad that he had arrived. While in all likelihood Brad was in one of those two cabins next to him, just feet away, Alex wanted a moment to be in his own little world. Laying down his 5'6 frame spread out and covered most of the queen sized bed. It was comfy, doable for a few days. Not Holiday Inn or Embassy Suites, but it would do. His eyes closed behind his black rimmed glasses, his long-ish brown curly hair and full beard moving slightly as the wind blew through the cabin. His breathing slowed and his rather cuddly chest rose and fell slower as he just lay there. Not asleep, but also not fully awake.",

I'm looking for this in a  partner:\n\n* Fast to Normal speed.\u00a0 If you are the \"slow as molasses\" type, I am looking at around 3 posts a week.\n* Open to OOC, I really love chatting about our characters. **Discord, pls.**\n* We'll talk about where we will RP if you are interested.\n* Longterm player\n* My posts are between 2-3 paragraphs, but I can post novellas and I don't  mind 1 paragraphs but it shouldn't be the only thing you can post. I love to match or do more if inspired.\u00a0\u00a0 Don't be intimidated by this because I can be lazy too, I just don't want someone who finds it  difficult to do more than 3 lines, that's all.\n* I prefer to only doing f/m for romance, I do play females primarily and I play male npcs to add to the story.\n* I do have a preference for romance + drama, on top of my  action/adventure/fighting/danger.\u00a0 I really love character drama, so THROW IT AT ME.\n\nI have a few ideas, so I'll post them here but they are all 1x1.  THESE ARE NOT *GROUP* ROLEPLAYS:\n\n**The Gifted \\[WW1/WW2\\]**\n\nIn   this alternate history, people are born able as the \"Gifted\" that   allows them to use gunpowder in ways that were unnatural.\u00a0\u00a0 These people   could be men or women, but they are uncommon.\u00a0 WW1 was changed only   slightly as the trench warfare had those that were difficult to kill due   to the Gifted.\u00a0 These Gifted when \"raptured\" were faster, hardier and   could see better at the heightened emotions.\u00a0 So, countries began a   draft to test men and women as Gifted and sent them out to aid   countrymen whether they wanted to or not.\n\nOf  those, some are trained and mentally manipulated to be assassins;   Rocketeers.\u00a0 They usually have a shortened lifespan to a few years after  so much gunpowder use has worn them out.\u00a0 Currently, on the Western   Front, the French are hard at work taking German soldiers who recently   threw their own Gifted and Rocketeers after all agreed not to use them   for warfare.\u00a0 I have a high preference to play a woman Gifted/Rocketeer   for this and would prefer someone to be in her battalion or she is   caught by someone on the other side.\u00a0\u00a0 This can work for WW2, but I am   REALLY LOOKING for WW1 this time.\u00a0\u00a0 Since this is just a base idea, we  can add on it.\u00a0\u00a0 I would like this to go toward a more dystopian future   where the allied powers lose.\n\n**Fandoms**\n\n* Resident  Evil:\u00a0 Looking to play a scientist/bioweapon or oc stars member/bioweapon.\u00a0 I'm looking to play with someone who knows the  fandom, who is alright with some mature themes.\n* Final Fantasy: VII, FFXIII and I play canon characters.\u00a0 I do have an OC for FFVII, so we can try to talk around this.\n* Suikoden: If you know this fandom, we will figure it out.\n* Man in the High Castle: WW2 alternate history, I'm open to play this setting.\n* Walking Dead: I'm looking to play my bio-weapon character and we can figure it out from there.\n* Silent Hill:  I want to play Angela before she did the things she did and after.\n\n**Original Worlds/Fantasy/World Building**\n\nI have an original fantasy setting, it's high fantasy and I am looking for these pairings. I am the bold one.:\n\n* Soldier/**Artificial Life** \\[\\*\\*Your character would likely be driven mad, possibly.\\]\n* Fae Hunter/ **Fae**\n* Soldier / **Violent Chosen One**\n* Monster Hunter /\u00a0**Monster Girl**\n* **Angel** / Demon\n\nThere are some ideas that are not listed but are kind of specific, so they can't be generalized down.  My cyberpunk/scifi ideas are mostly surrounded by detective stuff,  interstellar, space exploration stories. \u00a0I have nothing set for that, but I am really looking to do it. \u00a0 I guess that's all I got!

            "selftext": "The Great Martian War \n\n1914, a year that would change the fate of Europe forever. On the 28th of January, Arch Duke Franz Ferdinand escaped a would-be assassination attempt by a self-proclaimed Serbian Nationalist. Tensions grew between the Austro-Hungarian Empire and Serbia to a boiling point. In Germany, the Kaiser's army had been secretly developing plans for a swift invasion of both Russia and France, miles upon miles of trenches and barbed wire lined the border between France and Germany. In the East, Tsar Nicolas was beginning to see the ever-looming threat of the Communist uprising encroach on him, however, with more and more brutal repressions and the sending of spies and assassins, the Communist dream of revolution was shattered when Vladimir Lenin and the other masterminds behind the would-be revolutionaries of the Bolshevik party were executed. \n\nAcross the Isles, Great Britain could see the signs of war coming and so declared a general mobilization and a general armament program was pushed through parliament. Across the Commonwealth, telegrams were sent out, \u201c-- BY ORDER OF THE CROWN -- WAR LOOMING IN EUROPE. BEGIN ARMAMENT. --\u201d \n\nWar, at least not on a conventional level, would come, instead, on the 3rd of April, 1914, a Farmer by the name of Joseph Meyer, was witness to an impact of a meteor. Soon after, multiple lightning strikes would hit in the same location of the crash site. Within hours, a German Company stationed near the area was sent to investigate. Upon arrival, they were witnesses to an event that would change the shape of Europe. \n\nOver the next five months, other meteors would crash down across the world. In Asia, Africa, the Americas and Europe, and quickly, large \u201cMartians\u201d would begin to climb from them, beginning their conquest. The year is 1915, Europe is a war zone on all fronts, fronts being a loose word. A new batch of British soldiers were to land in France at Brest. These men would be apart of a new force that would be assigned to move behind enemy lines and gather up soldiers caught behind and also to recon for intelligence that could give the human forces and edge in the war. \n\nIf you have read this, thank you. This story is really not for the faint of heart, and if you don\u2019t like war, blood and guts, the idea of human experimentation and so on, please, I would highly recommend you don\u2019t pursue this. This RP will also require a basic or advanced knowledge of the First World War. Please add me at Corporal Ray Person #8741 if you are interested. Leave any questions and whatnot in the comment section and I will try to get a reply to you. Thank you.",

            "selftext": "To anyone whom may be viewing, welcome. \n\nI am on the search for a Star Wars themed role-play with an emphasis of including the character Darth Maul. However, I am also seeking to dwell into the popular genre of romance with action, drama and suspense. Been loving this prompt for quite some time! Looking for a few more partners. = ) \n\n* For a little background Maul has always been one of my favorite sith villains in the entire franchise and his ever expanding character development has intrigued me from the very beginning. As I\u2019m sure...we all have that one character that clicks for us.\n\nThis role would take place either during the Clone Wars or Rebels universe. My character would be a female human Jedi spending her days thriving and surviving in the time of war. With that being said I am looking for a partner who would be willing to play Maul. (I also wouldn\u2019t mind playing in a different time period/setting). \n\nThe plot is a simple one in which this female Jedi and Sith have developed an understanding for each other that has blossomed into something forbidden. They have spent many years keeping a low profile on their shared relation but things always almost prove to be difficult for the pair. With the brink of War and Maul\u2019s death it seems as though the two would never come face to face again. \n\nIn the years before the New Hope a Galactic Empire has risen, hunting down the last of the Jedi while new rebellions form. With this female Jedi missing and a well alive Maul thirsting for vengeance perhaps the two will meet again? \n\nThis is a rough idea and I would love to come up with a more complex plot or a different plot altogether if necessary. I want to thank everyone who has read this far. \n\nNow a little bit about me...\n* I have been role-playing for about 5+ years.\n* I prefer third person but will do first.\n* I tend to write multiple paragraphs and would prefer my partner do the same. I can go up to 6+ paragraphs or around 3-4. \n\nIf anyone is interested go ahead and send over a PM. I would be happy to answer and address any questions or concerns you may have. \n\nHope everyone is having a splendid day or night. Happy role-playing!\n\n\u2022 Preferred platforms: Discord, Hangouts, PM, e-mail",

            "selftext": " Thanks to a bit of boredom and curious of how a Japanese bathhouse is, the idea for the roleplay you see here was made. Thanks to his parents suddenly deciding to do work overseas, a senior high school student has to move in with a pair of childhood friends that he hasn't seen in ages. These two however run a family business:A bathhouse. Along side now going to school with them, he now has to help the two run the bathhouse.\n\nNow in terms of how I roleplay and preferences to partners, I typically do better writing at least a paragraph or two but I can do more if you are up to it. I also find it more fun to play more than one character but that is just me so I don't mind if you just want to stick to one.\n\nNow of course we all do have lives including my own self so if you are busy, do not worry too much about it but do at least give a heads up if something does come up. And lastly please at least be above 18 since I don't want a case on my hands and there could be possible NSFW themes.\n\nFor location and timezone stuff, United States and my timezone is EST.\n\nIf you're interested or have any questions, just message me and I will send you my discord stuff.",

            "selftext": "Six months ago, the unthinkable happened; at a summit intended to broker the first real, lasting truce between the superheroes and supervillains of the world, everyone attending disappeared. All that were left were the scraps, the remnants, the ones that were left; the weak, the rookies, the old, the retired, the injured, and the cripplingly-specialised.\n\nIn other words, you. \n\nOne month ago, letters and emails appeared in mailboxes and inboxes, inviting you- yes, you- to become part of a new Hero initiative. The world needs hope, you were told; the world has villains and criminals that still need to be stopped; the world needs you. You were told to report to Worthing Academy For Troubled Youths- secretly the pre-eminent school for the gifted- where the Headmaster, the Faceripper, renowned ex-hero and mentor to the elite would welcome you.\n\nToday, you meet at the academy for the first day of the rest of your lives. Welcome, heroes. Welcome, all.\n\nWhatever Happened To All The Heroes? is a literate, group roleplay based around the incoming class to the Worthing Academy, and their adventures and misadventures. We're a friendly group who like to kick back and chat as much as we like to get some serious roleplaying done. With plenty of experience of both group and individual roleplays, you'll find an environment of people who love to write, and who love to write well, and who love to tell a story.\n \n**A few ground rules:**\n All characters are weak. That's just the way of the universe. There's no Supermen here, no Batmen or Wonder Women or Captain Americas. At best, you'll be a retired hero who was sidelined for being old; at worst, you're a rookie with no control, no experience, and no respect.\n\nPlease be 'literate'. That means at least a couple of plot-advancing paragraphs per post. Loners and passive-aggressive corner-sitters will need to put in extra effort to be involved; you'll have to come us, we won't come to you.\n\nPlease be active; taking a few days out here and there is fine, but if you're going to be inactive for long periods of time, please let someone know.\n\nHave fun!: We're all fans of superheroes, and if you're not having fun, what's the point, right?\n\nAll characters must be of legal age; college age at the youngest. For liability reasons, the school is unable to accept students under the age of 18, even if they 'look over 18', or 'are secretly a 100 years old'. \n\nOkay, so feel free to message me with questions and stuff. If you're looking to join, put your favourite superhero- or villain- in the title, and answer me these questions three:\nHow much experience do you have?\nIf you had any superpower, what would it be, and would you use it for good, evil, or personal gain?\nIt's not a question, but a quick one-paragraph writing sample would be great.\n\n**Please do not use Reddit chat. I don't use it, and will ignore all messages that come through on it**.\n\n\nSee you soon, hopefully!",

PK here and guess who's been binge watching BoJack Horseman again? **This guy!** With that said, I'm here with something a bit different than my standard roleplay interests. I'll just come right out and say it:\n\nIt's a wish fulfillment roleplay through and through. I'm looking for someone to play everyone's favorite dorky girl horse - Hollyhock Manheim-Mannheim-Guerrero-Robinson-Zilberschlag-Hsung-Fonzerelli-McQuack! - in a romantic-slice-of-life type roleplay that's also kind of surreal and over-the-top in the way that BoJack Horseman is known for. I do have a ~~totally not self-insert~~ character in mind, but admittedly he's not as fleshed out as I'd like him to be and I have several different idea and iterations of him. He's definitely a work in progress - but hey, *aren't we all?*\n\nI was thinking this roleplay would take place at Wesleyan University in Connecticut since that's where Hollyhock is in-universe. However, I'm also open to AUs where she stays in Hollywoo~~d~~ with BoJack or something! If you've got ideas, we can definitely hash them out.\n\nAnyways, if you're interested in helping me with this very specific and esoteric wish fulfillment idea, I'd love to play it out (obviously). I will be the first to admit that slice-of-life roleplays aren't my forte, however, so this'll be an interesting experience if it happens B) Also, kudos to anyone who even bothered clicking on that title and getting this far, because what the heck, it's a really weird request, ain't it? Thanks for even indulging me this long tbh.\n\nIf you've never clicked on one of my prompts before, I'll go ahead and let you know I'm a 27 year old male because that's kind of important. And, while we're at it, here's some other important info!\n\n* Be 18 or older. Sorry youngin's, but I'm **definitely** not interested in roleplaying an idea like this with anyone under 18 for a number of (what I hope are) obvious reasons. Plus, I'm just more comfortable playing with people closer to my own age.\n* I'm looking for paragraph-style, third-person responses. If you can't do that, I'm sorry, but I'm probably not interested in doing this roleplay with you.\n* Length and descriptions can fluctuate. I'm not expecting you to summon your inner Stephen King and crank out a novel every time you write to me, and honestly I probably won't be able to do the same for you. As long as you put some degree of effort into your posts, I'm okay with that.\n* As a matter of fact, seeing as how this is supposed to be a very close, interpersonal relationship based roleplay, there will probably be a lot of \"just dialogue\" posts - so hey, there's that!\n* If you're **really** interested in this, I'd suggest sending me more than just a generic \"hey, I saw your post and I'm interested!\" message. I honestly tend to ignore those kinds of messages. Tell me a little bit about yourself and your interests, like how much you enjoyed any of the series I mentioned! Or other series that you've enjoyed over the years! Or your roleplaying experiences! You don't have to tell me your entire life story, but anything besides just a simple \"hello, I'm interested\" is much appreciated and will most likely go a lot further.\n* If you've actually read all of this, please put \"Dilly Dally\" as your message subject. It'll help me sort out the people who read this from the people who didn't!\n* I'm not looking for *just* a roleplay partner, I would like to be friends too! I think a roleplay is much more interesting when you interact with and befriend the person(s) you're playing with. It especially helps when it comes to activity and world building. If you want to keep our relationship professional though, that's fine too.\n* I absolutely do not expect multiple responses a day, or even a single response a day, because I can't even promise that myself. Sometimes you hit weird moods or life gets in the way and that's fine! However, I would prefer that we let each other know if we aren't going to reply for a while or if we're having a hard time coming up with a response.\n* Typically I'm not interested in NSFW elements, but given the nature of this roleplay, I am way more open to it than normal. However, it's not a given and I really don't care if things like that happen or not.\n* As a BoJack Horseman themed roleplay, we'll probably be tackling some more mature themes... if you've seen the show and have any concept of what I'm asking for, you know what I mean.\n* I'm an old-school forum roleplayer so that's the platform I'm used to ~~i'm so old rip~~. That being said, Discord is obviously the most convenient way to roleplay these days and my posts often break the character limit and require multiple messages as a result. I'm also open to roleplaying through e-mail, on forums (if those are still a thing lmao) or even on here in the DMs! I *may* be open to GoogleDocs, if you're willing to be patient with me and help me learn how to do it.",

I prefer writing in third person, my response length ranges anywhere between 200-800 words, I use face claims and I absolutely love world building. \n\nI do not have a preference when it comes to playing a gender and will most likely let you decide first. I do not double but I am more than happy to include side characters to advance the plot.\n\nMy criteria is as follows:\n\n*Please be 21+. I\u2019m twenty-three and would prefer partners closer to my age.\n\n*Keep up the pace. I understand if the story hits a snag and slows down but I will lose interest if I send a lengthy message only to receive one paragraph as a response. I use to write fan fiction so I know how frustrating writing can be but that\u2019s okay! We can toss ideas around on discord or make a Pinterest board for some inspiration. \n\n*Ideally, I would like something long-term. However, we do not always have to discuss business. \n\nMy preferred genres are: \n\nFantasy, supernatural, romance, police procedurals, science fiction, dystopia, medieval, and post-apocalyptic. \n\nLastly, my main methods of communication are discord and e-mail.

It would be nice if you introduced yourself with your name and such little details so I don't feel like I'm roleplaying with a robot - OOC chat is okay and is even something I'd consider vital to start with!\n\nBasically, I would like (almost) any type of modern roleplay with many pairings considered, if that's your bag rather than slice-of-life scenarios.\n\nIt's really that simple!\n\nChuck pairings and situations at me! Most 'realistic' modern scenes fall under what I would do - highschool, roommates, band members, brothers-in-arms, drug addict x dealer, anything else you can think of that isn't fantasy based, basically.

            "selftext": "## The Antium Empire\n\nAntium is a medieval fantasy roleplaying server set in a land ridden with conflict. A land forcefully taken over by a former military general has left the kingdom and it's towns in a state of disarray. Corruption and crime riddle the land both on the surface and beneath it. Even where it seems peaceful, deep within the roots of every nation corruption runs deep. Set in this world, its' to your character to pick what they wish to do. A land full of opportunity, whether to take advantage of the many in need, or to provide them with the help so desperately seek.\n\n\u00a0\n\n## What is Antium?\n\nSo, let's break down to what Antium itself really is! Antium is a place for those who are looking for a controlled roleplay with an enjoyable story, player connection, and adventure across the large area that is The Antium Empire. Now, of course, there are restrictions that keep the server running well and ensure that characters do not go overboard with their powers and abilities, stray away from edge-lords, and there are a few things that tie into the lore of the server itself. Things like a set list of magical affinities one can obtain, but do not worry these are mere guidelines and magic is not solely limited to this set list and you could just speak to one of our staff about more! \u00a0\n\n## What makes it unique?\n\nSo, what exactly makes us different? What makes our community and roleplay experience something different from other servers? Well, we run off a custom lore and background. This is meant to mean that no other server holds such an environment. Though, in the case of Antium's uniqueness, it entails that no other server will contain the lore we have, the aspects we do, or the set land and its social environment and dangers the way Antium is. This server is set for a more larger-scale roleplay hence due to it's larger map and variety of channels, this means the more the merrier, but this has not broken roleplay down and there are locations to act as hubs for characters to rest back in and converse with one another which will help stray from boredom of being alone in the vast lands!\n\n\u00a0\n\n## What are the 'requirements'?\n\nSo, what are the requirements? We ask that be able to speak English fluently and have a proper understanding of what serious roleplay is! This isn't a place either to go make a PC that can turn into a 76 headed snake that can spit out goblins and giants. There is, of course, a bit of reading to be done when coming into the roleplay in the information provided, but it ensures you know everything you need to! \u00a0\n\n## Tl;Dr\n\nAntium is a new fantasy roleplaying community that provides a unique lore and background for characters to enjoy, along with a friendly community of players within the Discord. While new and small, we hope to build up a playerbase that will allow for the best experience and a large diversity among the characters. The roleplay is set for a more large-scale environment, but roleplay contains hubs as to prevent boredom from character failing to be near one another. It's the perfect place if you're looking for a new active server to get into that holds a unique sense and feel to it! We hope to see some more new faces coming to our community!\n\nDiscord Link: [https://discord.gg/EEbjSyj](https://discord.gg/EEbjSyj)",

Set in the late 1980s in a fictional city called Raven Cove, Oregon, our characters must solve mysteries, challenge monsters, and worst of all, form interpersonal relationships.\u00a0\n\n\\-\n\nWelcome to Raven Cove, a small town in rural Oregon. It\u2019s 1987, and as the decade begins to wind to a close, things are only winding up for this city where not everything is as it appears. Although it appears normal enough at first glance, Raven Cove is home to a variety of mysterious forces that like to toy with the residents. This little town seems to act as a magnet for all sorts of supernatural phenomena, drawing in everything from angels to aliens. As creatures like vampires and werewolves fight for territory, and shady experiments cause strange weather and other unexplained phenomena, will Raven Cove be able to hold itself together long enough to reach the 90s?\n\n\\-\n\n[More Info](https://ravencoverp.tumblr.com/) ||[About](https://ravencoverp.tumblr.com/about) ||[Appl](https://ravencoverp.tumblr.com/app)y",

Bonus points to you if you play WarFrame because this is going to be based on that game ( spoilers just in case you are playing and haven\u2019t played the second dream on quest. )\n\nAdrian stood atop of the Grineer\u2019s Corpse ripping the Tipedo Prime\u2019s blade from it\u2019s chest. The bones and cartilage making a squelching noise as he did so. WarFrame\u2019s didn\u2019t sweat, however he could\u2019ve sword he felt a bead of water drip from the top of his visor. Fist bumping the clone that he had made he watched it disappear as he sat down. He didn\u2019t know how this latest extermination would\u2019ve gone. Placing the pole arm down he was enjoying these last few moments whenever he heard the voice that made him want to lean his head back and groan.\n\n\u201cTenno, you have new orders, extract immediately.\u201d\n\nThis was odd his mission was already over... he also could\u2019ve sworn he heard some kind of.. tension in her voice. She wanted him to get out and fast. Almost as if she didn\u2019t want him to find out about something.\n\n\u201cI was about to extrac-\u201c\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if you were about to do it, just do it!\u201d\n\nHe mumbled and shut off the communication path between them. Getting up and grabbing the pole arm again he made his way down the hallway whenever something caught his eye. An open room he didn\u2019t notice before. Peaking inside he could feel a shiver go down his WarFrame as he saw what was inside.\n\nI hope you enjoyed! If you\u2019re curious about the roleplay but don\u2019t know anything about the game don\u2019t worry I\u2019ll explain it! I\u2019m from the central time zone and will try to reply as quick as I can. I\u2019m just really busy now a days so it may not always be extremely quick. I want to do only third for this roleplay. This will also be an extremely long term roleplay. Thanks for reading!",

I write triggering themes no problem, those being suicide, self-harm, mental illness, etc. I am not insistent that you write paragraphs, just whatever amount of text you think fits during that scene. \n\nThe only thing I do insist on is proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation or it'll be difficult to read and understand.  I'm currently looking to roleplay with anyone, but the only requirement, whatever the verse, is established Spones. A Spock roleplayer would be my preferencial roleplay partner but I'll gladly write with you if you play any TOS and/or AOS canons.  I'm used to writing with more mainstream muses like Jim Kirk or Pavel Chekov, but muses like Khan Noonien Singh are welcome as well!  \n\nI have two Google Docs which provide more insight into everything. Obviously I cannot link to them here, but I can share them both with you upon request.  If you're still reading, then I presume you're interested, so message me for my blog url and to discuss this further.\n\nNote that I prefer to use tumblr over other platforms but if you do not have a roleplay blog or prefer discord, I can write with you over there instead.",

I most often do Star Wars and am always down for that, and am now also looking for a more fantasy oriented roleplay. I'm not super familiar with the LotR lore but can be persuaded into writing in that universe, otherwise a general fantasy world that we build together is also excellent.\n\nI've been writing on and off for a long time, over a decade now. I write in *3rd person past tense multi-paragraph* form with a general minimum of 2 paragraphs per reply, context permitting. I'm not afraid to - and often do - go over Discord character limit! I love little details and exploring characters as people, so I do require internal thoughts and feelings to be written! It's a bit difficult to get invested in a character and story if it's just 'he said/did this. she said/did this'. What about how they feel about it?\n\nFor NSFW elements and adult themes, I'm comfortable with pretty much anything with one exception. Also worth mentioning, if romance is present and progresses to the point of particular adult activities, I am comfortable writing things out in detail but sometimes will want to fade to black.\n\nSince adult themes may be involved 18+ *only* (Sorry!)\n\nFor this roleplay I would like us to discuss things OOC and do the actual roleplay on Discord. I would like for us to be friends too, if possible! If interested, please PM me with your age, what I can call you, a bit about your writing style, what you're interested in, NSFW limits, and your favorite color. Any messages without this info will be ignored. Please do not contact me if you're expecting smut to be a huge part of this roleplay. If you have any questions let me know!",

I wanted to make an rp focused on this weird world, except it\u2019s an AU and our characters are from a new company, company 11. I don\u2019t have a real plot in mind.\n\nNSFW is possible depending on how this turns out as I don\u2019t want it to be forced or the main focus\n\nJust a heads up: I\u2019m quite experienced with discord, however, I only recently installed Kik and I have never chatted on it, and reddit PMs are hard to rp on. Therefore, discord is preferred \n\nPm me if you are interested!",

I'm cool with sticking to the story or doing some AU stuff. A little slice of life and fluff is always fun too. \n\nI'm down for any post length. But I write 3rd person on discord.\n\nMy thing is, I'm looking for someone who's excited about this! Somebody eager that we can vibe off each other's energy!\n\nFantasy RP:\n\nI'm looking for something kind of DnD inspired. It could be a fantasy AU for an already existing fandom or we could come up with something organic and new. \n\nI like the idea of the multiple races and classes, magic and magical creatures and a main quest with various side things our characters could run around and do in the mean time. If you've ever listened to Not Another DnD Podcast, that's what I've been binging recently. \n\nMy Hero Academia:\n\nI like OCxCanon, canonxcanon depending on the characters. I'm always willing to double up story lines! Everyone should be happy and get who they want. You wanna play a canon for me, I'll play a canon for you!\n\nSo characters I'm looking for my partner to play:\n\nPresent Mic (Hizashi Yamada)\n\nTenya Iida\n\nShoji Mezzo \n\nTetsutetsu Tetsutetsu\n\nI'm down to try playing just about anyone for my partner. \n\nI'm open to other options and suggestions however as I'm really digging this stuff right now.

            "selftext": "Hello! Thanks for checking out my post, first of all I would like to say I roleplay on discord and I am free most of the time so I can reply pretty quickly and I expect the same, while I understand life can happen I expect a warning or a heads up before disappearing. I hate ghosting, so if you are going to ghost don\u2019t even bother messaging. I also keep the nsfw elements minimum and reasonable so if you are expecting a full erp don\u2019t message.\n\nWhen it comes to Roleplaying, I do it in thirdperson and I wrote at least a paragraph and a detailed responses and I expect the same. I understand sometimes it needs to be quicker I would be happy if you tried to keep it detailed and good. Quality over quantity though. I expect you to sometimes roleplay npc\u2019s as well, I will too of course. \n\nAs for the plot, I like dark themes and drama, I can tell you more about them if you want to know more about it. But basically I have two plot Ideas in mind, whichever you would prefer I am happy to discuss.\n\nThe Roleplay Ideas:\n\u2022 Adventure/Romance Roleplay Tomb Raider like, realistic.\n\u2022 Slice of Life Sweet Romance Roleplay.\n\nThanks for reading this far, just to make sure you\u2019ve read all of the post please put your favourite colour on the title of your dm. (also don\u2019t respond to the post or send a chat, JUST DM!)\n\nThanks, Take Care~",

Before I get too far here\u2019s some information about the setting.\n\nUmbra academy is a hidden school for all things mythical, it welcomes every creature that needs a safe place to call home, it's protected by the shadow forest also known as the forbidden forest, it surrounds Umbra academy it's used as a way to separate the academy from the humans but it's not the best defense as its only difficult to navigate, the students who look for the school once they find the forest are lead strait to the academy gate by mysterious blue flames known as Will O' Wisp. Trove Town use to never know the existence of Umbra academy until multiple strange and explainable things began happening that lead them to the forest which surrounds Umbra academy, The town's folk have become restless and impatient beginning to go on beast hunts when ever they can to get rid of the monsters that are haunting and terrorizing their beloved town. There are two other schools besides Umbra academy but there are only reports of there being only humans in these schools, Trove Town has many places to visit such as taverns, markets, shops, and more.\n\nEvery roleplay server offers a different community and feel, our server boasts a few features including but not limited to:\n\n-Friendly Admins -Rules that aren\u2019t too strict but prevent drama and create an immersive Rp experience -People who love to hang out and chat out of character -A newly added music channel with dedicated bots -And much much more!\n\nThis is our servers reboot, we are starting fresh with new members, characters, and roleplay areas.

First off all, I'm not exigent, at all but I do have one request.\n\n\n\nIf you're not enjoying the play, talk to your partner, figure what's wrong, educate, maybe it'll help not only one but both parties improve themselves. Ghosting is hurtful and rude so don't be ignorant.\n\n\nNow that my vent is over, let's head to the RP. I can do it on email or Discord, that's up to you. I like romance and lots of adventures on the play, that's a must but I don't mind a bit of slice of life too, life us not always at 100%. I'm fine with NSFW and we can discuss the limits. I'm very inexperienced with fantasy. As for my ideas, I only have small stuff which we can talk it out to create a nice plot: \n\nRivals become lovers. \n\nOC Superheros and/or villains. \n\nHarley and Joker. \n\nBatman and Catwoman. \n\nCanon superheros and/or villains. \n\nDetective. \n\nForbidden romance (detective/bad guy/girl, monarchy person and a gypsy, two people that work together.) \n\n\nThat's what I have for now and I'd also love to hear your ideas, if you're interested.

Maybe we should rewind a bit. The year was 2020, villians ran rampant and a strange force formerly classified as the rage affect was causing these villians a great deal of power....too much power...they were multiplying their forces and gaining ground quickly. Even Deathstroke had a mini army at his disposal. And then...things went south. It is now 2021, the former group of heroes known as the justice league is no more. Superman? Dead, the flash? MIA, batman? Crippled, you get the idea.... I was there when the whole ordeal went down..of course I was hiding. But that's not the point...he chose me..Billy Batson...or as the works knew him Captain Marvel or Shazam...He chose me as his new champion in the last few moments of his life. Even with the powers of 6 gods within me I ran, I couldnt fight alone. \n\nThat was far from the worst, now these groups are fighting each other, gang wars, terrorism and the likes are rampant and without heroes....we are hopeless to stop it. It was at that...hopeless moment I realized I had to do something. It seemed every hero has their villains. The Luthor to the superman, the joker to the batman. But...I had no idea mine would be you...\n\nGreetings! Just a small unpolished idea for a dystopian DC universe in which heroes are no longer the saviors the world needs. You would be playing the villian in this. Your name, powers, costume etc is all up to you! All I ask if that you are evil, whether it be lawful, neutral or chaotic evil. \n\nJust a few disclaimers if I get to many replies I may shift the story around to keep it fresh for me! But you may also bring some ideas to the table. I also dont do crossover characters unless the plot calls for it. Lastly I prefer we start sfw but if it gets into romance or more then that's okay given it's a slow burn.",

It used to be a town full of crime and despair. Nearly half the town was on some kind of drug, and another good percentage was also left unemployed.\n\nHowever, all this would change once the Overseer came, and gave us the happy pill. This significantly reduced the amount of crime in our town, and made it a much more positive and pleasant place to live in, eventually putting an end to the amount of crime and allowing citizens to pursue any kind of dream they had in mind!\n\n In this town, anyone can be anything without any of the stress and worries of modern life. We hope to see you join us! \n- Signed, the Overseer.\n\n-------\n\nPROJECT: WESTWOOD is both a mystery and slice of life RP located in the town known as \"Westwood\". Players are encouraged to investigate and explore the secrets of the town. We are also focused on building a welcome and free of judgement environment, where we're focused on helping players improve on their writing and character building as well. We hope to see you soon!\n\n-------\n\nhttps://discord.gg/SFhw7PB",

            "selftext": "**- Fable\u2019s Interest Check -**\n\n**Advanced | Novella | Multi-para**\n\nHello there! I\u2019m Fable (or nomdebloom, depending on where you found me), and I\u2019m a **+25 roleplayer** seeking a partner or two. I have around **15 years worth of roleplaying/writing experience** under my belt and have managed to settle firmly into a particular style of writing--**3rd person, past-tense**. My **average post length is around four paragraphs** and my **posting frequency is about 2-3 times per week** (though this varies depending on work schedule). I\u2019m pretty **friendly and enjoy OOC chat on Discord** between replies; I get a real kick out of imagining different scenes for the characters in each story as well as working out their personalities and backstories.\n\nI will happily tell you more about myself if needed, but I think this covers the basics!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**- Rules &amp; Expectations -**\n\n**+21 Only**\n\nThis isn\u2019t a hard and fast rule, per say, but you\u2019ll have to convince me if you don\u2019t technically meet this requirement. I will absolutely NOT write with anyone younger than 18. I, myself, am 27 and would prefer to write with individuals who are around my own age.\n\n**MxF Romance Only**\n\nI don\u2019t mean to put people off, but MxF is the only romantic pairing I am comfortable writing. It should be noted that I require at least the potential for romance in all of my plots. To offset this rather rigid rule, I will say that I am willing to play both male and female characters--though you should NOT assume that I will automatically play male. I dislike it when writers insist that they will only play their own gender as it seems incredibly narrow-minded and, frankly, insulting.\n\n**No Smut**\n\nI will be honest--I\u2019m not talented at writing these kinds of scenes. I\u2019m not opposed to them, but they are not what I am interested in and should be used sparingly. If our characters show compatibility and seem headed down that route then we will discuss it, but I am not here to satisfy your personal fantasies.\n\n**Google Docs for IC**\n\nThis is my preferred medium, not only because there is no limit on word count, but because it is easy to make documents visually pleasing and stories are easily searchable. I can be talked into email instead, of course, but I don\u2019t enjoy the format nearly as much.\n\n**Discord for OOC**\n\nThis is kind of mandatory. Roleplaying is my main creative outlet but also my main social outlet. I want to be friends with my partners and hear about how their day is going or exchange memes. As stated previously, I enjoy plotting and find that it is easiest to do in the context of Discord.\n\n**Do Not Pester Me**\n\nI don\u2019t think I need to remind most of you that ROLEPLAYING IS A HOBBY. I do not owe anyone replies and will get to them when I am able to sit down and write them. I do my best to alert partners to absences and delays, but if you start pinging me repeatedly I will become grumpy. To ensure that you have read this item in particular, tell me the name of your favorite book when you contact me.\n\n**Provide a Writing Sample**\n\nI request samples for several reasons, not the least of which is to check for style compatibility. I enjoy reading almost as much as writing and want to enjoy the stories we put together--and not become distracted by constant grammatical mistakes or the frequent use of historically inaccurate terminology and slang. I will provide my own samples in return.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**- Genres of Interest -**\n\nHistorical\n\n* Regency Era \\*\\*\\*\n* Victorian Era\n* American Civil War Era\n* Roaring Twenties\n* 1940s Old Hollywood Glamour\n\nFandom\n\n* The Phantom of the Opera \\*\\*\\*\n* Gone With the Wind\n* Pride &amp; Prejudice \\*\\*\\*\n* Jane Eyre\n\nOther:\n\n* Southern Gothic\n\nMy list is, admittedly, rather short but these are the only genres I am interested in at the moment. You are welcome to suggest others, but chances are good that I will decline. Asterisks indicate strong preference.\n\nIf any of this sounds appealing to you, please do not hesitate to reach out!",
