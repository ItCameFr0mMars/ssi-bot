You saw others , but how come you never see me?\n\nFor a decade I waited for you , to be graced by your presence as I grace you with mine at every corner - though you still do not take notice - and still I wait, you haven't come, nor ever will you come. I hope, but what is hope but a fools crutch.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n10 times I called out your name. I know you're not hard at hearing for you answer others even before they call you, even when they didn't call you and yet I still call out...Hear me!\n\n9 times I prayed for your touch but we both know God does not exist, well at least not for me. But still I pray.\n\n8 times I visited you. It's true that it was just your house and you were not there -I made sure you were not there - but still it counts. I hope to still visit again and maybe this time you will be there , maybe you'll even open the door for me , maybe you'll even jump into my arms and whisper you love me and want me inside of you... maybe.\n\n7 times I've kept you by my side, or at least a part of you - a strand of your hair, your underwear, the toothbrush you so clumsily disposed in the trash.

Haven't you learned by now that only I can love you the way you deserve to be loved?\n\n4 times you've lied to yourself . Yes! you are insecure .People do not really love you but only love what you can do for them. You tell yourself you will do what you know needs to be done, you tell yourself you will do it tomorrow, let's be serious you know you won't do it - but anything to make you feel better my love.\n\n3 times you have thought about killing yourself and others. I'd tell you not to but if you're adamant about killing yourself and ending it all then I will end it all along with you and if it is other's that deserve to meet their end, then I have a shovel.

She watched men who promised to buy her - *I'll set you free, pretty thing, I'll set you free* - blanch at the price her captors gave.\n\nThe knocks faded to taps that became irritated and disinterested when she stayed immobile, eyes closed, almost dead in the corner.\n\nThe novelty of all things fades, eventually.

Quicker still when you don't feed it, letting the silvery brilliance of its tail fade to the same sickly brown.\n\nFor all she was a shadow, Rai's connection to the sea still hadn't broken. She could still feel it thrashing under an angry sky. She curled, humming, voice warbled and ethereal and ugly and beautiful and broken, wondering if somewhere her sisters sang for her. If they had made the storm for her.\n\nShe almost didn't hear the knock.",

            "selftext": "Hello, everyone! I am Spiral a 20yo writer who spends a lot of time creating characters, running games of D&amp;D, and of course, being lost in thoughts. Before any details of roleplay, it is reaaallly important to me that you are willing to at least try to be friends! Roleplay to me is personal, our characters reveal parts of our thoughts, or how we escape from them, and the stories we tell are meaningful. I love to get to know the person behind the screen, so don't be afraid to talk about real life stuff! \n\nWith that aside, here's my details. I roleplay in a lot of styles, but I think for story telling I do prefer third person. It allows for more than one character to fit in nicely, and makes it read a lot easier afterwards. For length, I don't have a limit. I believe sometimes, you need to write short posts. Sometimes, you need to write long ones. It depends on who is leading the current scene, how many characters are in action, what that action is. If your post is just dialogue, that's fine! When you read a book, there isn't ALWAYS constant actions. But the important thing is to just do what feels write. I sometimes write two sentences in a post, especially when back-and-forth dialogue is happening. But then on a new scene, I may write several paragraphs, describing the environment and people's reactions.\n\nFor settings, I do love anything that is created by one of us. I don't have many settings, but being a DM for D&amp;D has definitely gotten me to start exploring more about how to create these words, and immerse people in them. That being said, if you have a interesting setting you made up, from one town to an entire kingdom, let me know and I'll dive right into it! On the other hand, I'm not big for fandom settings. To me, I don't know enough fandoms to really be well immersed in them, and then I worry about all the rules that are in said setting that if broken can break immersion. I do love taking premade settings and reimagining them. For example, I have a Dark Souls inspired setting that is focused on the death of gods, the flooding of the world, etc... ..but still carries the themes of Dark Souls, from giant monsters, overwhelming dread, and constant hopelessness against the odds.\n\nSpecifically, I'm a big fan of fantasy and modern-day fantasy. Anything from a war between empires in some fantastical setting, to the encounter between an individual of the faewild and someone born in the city. One of my favorite starters, no matter the setting, is two characters of two very different cultures meeting. Especially when one is more fantastical than the other.\n\nOther than that, yeah, that's all I really have! I do any gender characters, though a lot of mine are male. I don't mind shipping and NSFW content, but the story comes first, always! I'm not afraid of drama between characters, because drama is what drives stories. I don't mind any type of character, from gender to species, multiple characters, anything. And finally, I primarily use Discord to roleplay, in order to keep the message searchable and rereadable, and for quick response time on any devices.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you have any questions, let me know! If you made it this far, and still aren't interested, that's okay! Have a wonderful day!",

            "selftext": "Hello to all of you lovely lurkers and fellow roleplay subreddit subscribers! I\u2019m back again with another post because I\u2019m currently looking for some new partners! Classes are back in session now so I am a little busier than usual but I still have a decent amount of free time (especially during nights.) \n\nBefore I explain some of the ideas I have in mind, let me elaborate a little bit on myself. I\u2019m a 22 year old female who enjoys playing both genders and in most cases can write multiple characters as well. I prefer to write MxF stories but will consider other pairings if the story warrants it. The only thing I\u2019m not flexible on is literacy. I write in 3rd person, past tense, and expect my partners to do the same. As far as length goes, I average anywhere from 4-6 paragraphs but am capable of doing much more when the situation warrants it. These \u201crequirements\u201d are just to ensure we are as compatible as possible.\n\nI am perfectly fine with NSFW content of all natures as long as it is actually fits into the situation. If you\u2019re looking for someone who writes pure smut, we probably won\u2019t work well together. \n\nWith my boring yet obligatory introduction out of the way, let me get into some of the prompts:\n\n  - **Horror/Sci-Fi :** I\u2019ve really been craving something in the rough style of Welcome to Night Vale, but darker. If you are not podcast-savvy, the central idea is a small town that is home to all sorts of strange happenings. The cause of these events ranges from paranormal to extraterrestrial and there\u2019s a number of ways that we can approach this. [Lovecraftian horror and suspicious/menacing local government figures galore.]\n\n  - **Historical:** After recently re-watching The Hateful 8, my interest in Westerns has been reignited! I\u2019m not looking for anything canon but if you have any ideas ranging from the pure golden age \u201cWild Wild West\u201d to the 1920s, I\u2019m your gal. I also have a looooong idea of my own that I\u2019m not going to type out here, so inquire further if that sounds up your alley!\n\n  - **Renaissance Misadventures:** I don\u2019t have an exact prompt fleshed out for this but I\u2019ve always had an interest in the Italian Renaissance. Assassins, philosophers, soldiers, and cultural revolution; there\u2019s just so many options. A maestro and prodigy dynamic comes to mind.\n\n**Fandoms:** I\u2019m not looking to follow any canon to a T right now but if you\u2019re looking for a fandom role-play or just want to get a better idea of the themes I\u2019m best at writing, I figured I would list a few more things below:\n  - Red Dead Redemption\n  - The Witcher\n  - A Song of Ice and Fire\n  - Days Gone (I love apocalypse tropes)\n  - The Twilight Zone (short stories, anyone?)\n  - Labyrinth\n  - Annihilation (UFO contact sights, research scientists, and black ops) \n  - Tanis/Archive 81/The Black Tapes\n  - Silent Hill\n  - Many, many more that I\u2019m sure I\u2019m leaving out!\n\n\nWoooo, that was a long one! I tried to sum everything up as short as I could but I have a lot of ideas right now and it\u2019s hard not to ramble. If there\u2019s anything I forgot to add that you think would be of interest, don\u2019t hesitate to send me an orange envelope! The worst I can do is say no or suggest some changes, right? I\u2019m also available on Discord and Google Docs.\n\nCiao!",

It\u2019s better to be friends with the person you\u2019re roleplaying with, ya know?\n- My favorite genres are: psychological horror, low/high fantasy, modern slice of life, historical fiction, and western, in that order!\n\nJust so you know, I already have a few worlds and plots ready, but if you\u2019d like to make one with me I\u2019m totally game!\n\nThank you for reading my post- I really hope you\u2019ll be interested!",

I\u2019m not a stickler on history, so some inaccuracies do not really bother me. This means alternative history or more fantasy centred plots are welcome. I will however judge these a little harder than normal plots.\n\nI can play both male and female roles and I\u2019m also as flexible when it comes to pairings. I prefer FxM, but can also do FxF and MxM. Whilst I do like romance, I do enjoy it when it has some good build up. The same goes with NSFW themes. I am entirely fine with roleplaying NSFW themes, but that doesnt mean the entire roleplay should revolve around it. \n\nI\u2019m really bad at marketing myself, since I don\u2019t see myself as anything all that special. I usually write around 3 to 4 paragraphs and consider myself literate enough to have proper punctuation, grammar and vocabulary. \n\nIf this has convinced you to roleplay with me, great! If it hasn\u2019t, I still appreciate you for reading my post. Any questions I\u2019d be more than willing to answer via DM/Chat.\n\nMuch love,\n\nMunch.",

The United States is at war, but not against a foreign power, but itself and it's former citizens. With dwindling resources, in a last ditch effort President Derek Long has ordered the creation of a small Task Force to cross military lines and apprehend and detain the Scientist behind it all - Peter Sheridan.\nWelcome to Task Force Slayer.\n \nHello everyone! My friend and I are looking to create a small group military-themed role-play based around the outbreak of the Zombie apocalypse in the western United States. Ideally, we'd like to find four more like-minded individuals interested in filling our team. Apart from their squad roles, you have complete creative freedom of your character.\n \nRoles we're seeking:\nRifleman - Close range infantry\nMarksman - Long range infantry\nMedic - Handles well-being of other member of the Task Force.\nCivilian Contractor - Flex role. Could be anything in reason (Doctor/Scientist/etc.)\n \nPartners we're seeking:\n- Any person who 18+ who uses Discord and comfortable with a broad range of NSFW topics.\n- At least semi-literate. I would say an ideal reply length would be between 1-3 paragraphs. The expectation is a firm grasp on the English language.\n- Willing and able to reply at least once a day to keep the role-play in forward motion.\n- Prior military knowledge is NOT necessary. If you need help or have questions we're more than happy to assist.\n- As this is a small group, we're hoping that will afford the chance for everyone to get to know each other. We'd love a group that can chat/share memes/give inspiration.\n \nPlease send me a DM if you're interested with your Discord and we can chat more! I'll be checking my Reddit DMs periodically every evening and morning, so don't feel discouraged if I don't respond immediately!",

            "selftext": "Hello! This is a DC based rp in which I will be playing an oc of mine shortly after his induction as a hero, and you? His first super villian. The story motives and such I'd like for us to discuss together but I will give descriptions/bios of the universe and characters \n\nCian(aka the Cryolater) was adopted into a rich family at the age of 4, his parents are unknown but he doesnt care. At 12 he discovered he had a knack for science and began to form an interest in cryogenic theory. At 13 however he watched his adopted family die at the hands of two-face and his newly formed mafia. Cian was taken and forced into a life of servitude for Dent. Through the next few years he managed to create new tech in secret, a suit capable of withstanding absolute zero temperatures while remaining skin tight and a cryogenic blaster than could freeze anything given time. He also managed to be on the bitter end of Gothams more extreme characters. He met them all....The Joker, Quinn, the Riddler you name it. See in this universe Dent had formed a secret society where each villian could benefit from the others chaos...only thing is they didnt know that the others were involved. Time skip to the now 17 Cian, who was part of a big robbery attempt using his tech, lucky for him Batman was there to stop him. Cian was among those arrested but apon realising his age, potential and opportunity. Batman made a deal with him to get him out of the life of crime. He wasnt exactly the new Robin but he was now under the wing of Bruce Wayne. No need to go much further but following this Cian discovered he was the only known relative of Bane the super villian gone anti-hero for his own reasons. He later formed a friendship with the new Mr. Freeze who had recently turned himself in but was given a lighter sentence and a chance to start over if he agreed to help the medical field as he had discovered the cure for many previously incurable diseases. Alongside Batman, Bane and a few other notable characters Cian worked to dethrone Harvey Dent, rather than dismantling the Mafia Cian provided a new idea. Allow the Mafia to stay under the watch of Bane, who would keep each respective gang in check while allowing them to remain as to not cause further chaos as a result. A strange theory but it worked. Within weeks gang violence was isolated to a select few areas, crime had gone down in Gotham as a whole, and to top of off Bane was on the good side.\n\nThings went well from then on. Cian continued to further his research, knowledge and understanding of the tech he was working with. He formed a friendship with Billy Batson. Was officially inducted into the Teen Titans, and was accepted into a prestigious college (with only a small bit of help from Bruce) all was going great until...she came to Gotham. Who is she? Well other a mysterious, hawk-eyed sharp shooter who looked killer in black and red...she was Petra, a 19 year old who's life was much life Cians only she took a darker path and became one of the biggest criminals to date, at only 19 she had a kill count that even Joker was amazed by. She was the adopted daughter of Slade Wilson. Though his real daughter already took the new mantle of Deathstroke, Petra made her own name as a big time law breaker. She was on a mission to undo the calm caused by the mafia shift and cause chaos once more. She couldn't directly go after the leader, with the snap of his fingers Bane could turn the tide and get some poor gang to help for a small sum of cash. She knew the right idea would be to go small scale to draw him out, her target....The cryolater.\n\nI did my best to explain the plot and hope to get some replies! The story of course is flexible and I can explain anything if questions arise! I'd like for this to include a slow burn romance between Cian and Petra, a forbidden one (much like Spider-man and black cat, or batman and catwoman) Of course if the story doesnt interest you I also have side plot including other DC characters if youd like OR we can form a whole new story! I'd love to see your way of playing Petra as shes a new character of mine! Feel free to message me if you want to try or have questions!",

About a hundred years ago, three heroes, chosen by the gods themselves, rose up and stopped the evil Mage, Lucanis, from undoing the world and creating his own version of it. But now, the heroes are gone, and the world still has plenty of problems to deal with.\n\nIn Alyria, you can be anything you want. Magic is taught and learned at both the Guild of Mages and the Fae College, though the latter is exclusively for fae and ethically dubious. Or perhaps adventuring is more your style? The Fighter\u2019s Guild resides in the human capital, and accepts all, so long as they can prove their strength and honor. If honor isn\u2019t quite your thing, then you may seek out the Thieve\u2019s Guild to seek your fortune or simply become a mercenary. There is also the Mirage, a group of expert assassins, feared by nearly every noble person. No one quite knows how to join them, though if you catch their attention, perhaps they\u2019ll seek you out.\n\nHello there, it\u2019s me, your lovely GM for this adventure. No matter what faction you pick, I\u2019ve got an adventure planned out for you. You\u2019ll deal with everything from everyday people to the gods of Alyria themselves. If this little introduction has intrigued you, shoot me a message and we can get down to character creation! I\u2019m super open to whatever you ideas are. No matter what you come at me with, I\u2019ll do my best to make it work! I hope for this to be long-term, with you character forging connections with mine, and hopefully helping the world along the way. Perhaps you\u2019ll even meet the previous heroes. The only way to find out is to message me!",

We're based in a quiet, remote North American town completely cut off from the rest of society. In this alternate universe, Vampires have managed to dwell and thrive in this relative peace - arriving and populating the majority of the town, pushing the human population down to around 50%. Here, you'll pick whether you live as a regular human, a hunter, or a vampire. It's 2019, after all, and people tend not to discriminate. But, despite the harmony, there are always people on both sides that are born with natural contempt for their opposites. Come create a character and see if you can survive in Griffin!\n\n**This is semi-lit and we require you to be 18+.** Hope to chat soon!!",

Im open to almost any genre, though I\u2019d say I\u2019m most comfortable with historic (medieval, western, etc.) I\u2019m fine with tossing in some adventure or supernatural aspect but I want the main theme to be a love story. \n\nI prefer to play female opposite of a male but your actual gender doesn\u2019t matter to me. I mainly use Discord and I would like a literate partner.

            "selftext": "Feel free to skip the explanation if you know what Ghouls are.\n\nFor those of you unfamiliar with Tokyo Ghoul. Ghouls in this anime look exactally the same as humans, except their biology causes them to have to feed on humans for food. Their stomachs reject anything else from being digested by throwing up any other common food items. There are only a very few exceptions to this rule 1, water 2, coffee. \n\nThey are stronger, faster, and much more durable than normal humans as well, they have a healing factor, and are able to go roughly 1-2 months without food after a full body is consumed. They have two defining give aways that can differentiate ghouls from humans, on command they are able to make their eyes red, with a pitch black sclera Their eyes will also turn when they are starving, completely out of their control.\n\n The last defining feature of a ghoul is something called the Kagune. It's a tough muscle like appendage that ghouls are able to hide at will. The only time these are ever out is in a combat senerio. They use these extremely powerful weapons to hunt their prey, and to fight other ghouls if need be. The Kagune is one of the very few things known to be able to damage a ghoul reliably. \n\nDespite all of this many ghouls try and blend in with humanity, only feeding when absolutely necessary, and when feeding doing so on humans that are already deceased. Generally by suicide, or by other humans killing them. Basically operating as scavengers. Considering how long they can go without food this is surprisingly viable.\n\n**Summary over**, if you have any questions let me know I would be glad to explain and I do have pictures for reference if I didn't do I good job explaining.\n\nAll the signs were there, your new roommate was a ghoul, or at least you thought so. He was always polite, respected your space, but at the end of the day you couldn't shake this feeling in the back of your mind something was off. He wasn't intimidating at all, just a little creepy. It didn't make much sense how a twinkish guy standing at 5'4\" could ever be creepy.\n\nIt started when you slowly realized after you moved in there was never really any food in the house, Just water, and coffee. It got weirder when you caught him sniffing you. Then you started to have more and more hunches and slowly figured it out. Even with all of these assumptions he hasn't eaten you yet, and there isn't any rock hard evidence. That is, untill you started hearing his stomach growling. \n\nIt kept growling, every day. You could see him start to get nervous, he started staying out extremely late, but still coming back with a growling stomach. He started smelling you again, and he began drinking a large amount of coffee. It all came crashing down when you walked in to the house pitch black and saw him curled up on the floor his stomach growling. When you approached him carefully, you touched him on the shoulder and he turned around and you saw his glistening red eyes, fueled by hunger. \n\nHe jumped on you pinning you to the ground with ease, drool running down his chin while he licked his lips. He opened his mouth and bit down on your arm, pain sparked through your body after a short moment you realize he stopped moving. His eyes reverted back to the human like pupils. Tears welling up in his eyes while he tasted flesh for the first time in nearing 3 months. \n\nAfter regaining his sanity he grabbed bandages and cleaned you up, the whole time looking horribly ashamed. His stomach, it still growled, his hunger still gnawed at him. He looked at you and promised he would explain everything when he came back. He just begged you not to report him to the authorities. \n\n(Thanks for reading) \n\nThis is getting very long so I'll save the questions and answers for the ole PMs",

To be a bit more specific though to cater towards more people, most of my ideas are SFW but I do have a few NSFW ones if they are interested. Of course also take a look at my profile for some of my ideas and if one catches your eye, don't be afraid to tell. \n\nI typically do better writing at least a paragraph or two but I can do more if you are up to it. I also find it more fun to play more than one character but that is just me so I don't mind if you just want to stick to one.\n\nNow I do have a life so there will be at times where I will be busy I do tend to keep updates on my situation so that you may know how it is and when I may be free or busy. Last thing though, please at least be 18 or older since I don't exactly like the thought of roleplaying with a minor and am more comfortable with people around my age with that being 20.\n\nFor location and timezone stuff, United States and my timezone is EST.\n\nIf you're interested or have any questions, just message me and I will send you my discord stuff.",

Maybe you knew me, even. Maybe not.\n\nI usually write in first person past tense (I looked at her, she looked at me, etc), and I'd prefer if you did, too. I might consider third person if you ask very nicely, but it's a rare occasion that I'll do it.\n\nI consider myself 'literate', and can write several paragraphs per post or reply or whatever. Though length does vary, I prefer to keep things at 3-5 per pop, so events can keep moving swiftly, and we don't get bogged down in unnecessary filler details that do nothing whatsoever to drive the plot along. Sometimes I might write a shorter amount, depending on energy levels or whatever, but I'm usually pretty consistent.\n\nI'm willing to give most genres a go, but I prefer slice of life stuff, modern day fantasy, historical fantasy, Victorian fantasy, science fiction (see a pattern here?), pretty much any kind of fantasy. Low or high doesn't matter, but I prefer things to be in some way not the norm at all, even if it might seem normal for the characters.\n\nSpeaking of, I prefer to play my own gender, but I can play female if it's necessary to the plot; if I do play female, I'd prefer us both to be playing that. I don't do mxm at all. I prefer to focus on two characters, bringing in others when needed, but I'm open to other alternative ideas too.\n\nI prefer the slow-burn romantic kinds of plots, with lots of character development, gratuitous adorableness, and lashings of angst and emotional turmoil. I'm not a huge fan of gore for gore's sake, or sex for sex's sake, but if it makes sense in context, I'm all for it.\n\nI have a few ideas floating round, and some more in my head that haven't yet been written anywhere. At the moment, I've got a few everyday ideas, a couple or three involving people with superpowers, a couple of Fantasy things, and some miscellaneous stuff, too.\n\nI'm around most of the time- though I am in GMT, so please bear that in mind, and can reply pretty regularly, and will attempt to match whatever I'm given in terms of quality, length, etc.\n\nI prefer to use Discord or something similar, Please don't send me messages on Reddit chat- I don't use it, and I will totally miss your messages.\n\nI look forward to hearing from whoever this might interest!",

And today I come to you guys today with a romance prompt, specifically one where I play an elf!\n\nI wanted to try to do a forbidden romance thing with this. Maybe the race you play can\u2019t really fall in love with elves? Something along those lines! Maybe it\u2019s just as simple as a class difference.\n\nThis is written for fantasy, but modern could be very fun too! Who knows, silly cute stuff might happen~.\n\nMessage if interested! I\u2019ll get to you as soon as I can!",

The Dollhouse is themed around the downward spiral of physcology, and how it affects both our mentality and already screwed up sleeping habits. The latter hints to the lucid dreaming aspect of the lore, and how y/c will be faced with a taunting question: What is reality? In the process of finding out what's real and what's not, The Dollhouse will begin to unravel it's mysteries and closed doors. You'll be surrounded by a group of mutually puzzled people, but you've all arrived in the same dream-like realm, it's up to you to find out why. \n\nIf you're interested, feel free to message me and I'll send the discord link!",

I know no one is perfect and never hold mistakes against anyone. My typical post length varies from 2-20 lines.\n\nNow on to genres and plots! I love anything anyone else is passionate about.

            "selftext": "Hello all! I've decided to go on a hunt for some roleplay partners. First, a bit about myself. \n\nI am a 20 year old girl who loves to create characters of all kinds and act out roleplays that are funny, romantic, and worth the time invested. While I do have my moments of business or tiredness, I am pretty free most the time. I roleplay in 3rd Person and my personal favorite genres are slice of life and/or modern fantasy mixed with romance. I'm not too picky on length but my comfort zone is 2-15+ lines depending on my level of creativity and how much the other person puts out. I do prefer LGBT roleplays although I can do straight roleplays. I prefer our characters to be able to change out on the who wears the pants role or for me to be the lesser pants wearer. Most of my characters are less masculine  or ambiguous. EST Time Zone.\nNow onto preferences for my partner. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMUSTS: \n\nMust be willing and able to have or create a decently fleshed out character. I have a character template that I use for my ocs if you need one. Character tropes are fine, although I take some issue with some but as long as they go beyond that trope and are their own person beyond 1 or 2 character traits, they're fine!\n\nMust have decent grammar and spelling. Now I know nobody's grammar or spelling is perfect, but I need to be able to understand what you're typing. \n\nMust reply at least every other day. I understand being busy and having times where you can't reply for a few days but id like to be notified if and when those things happen. I usually wait 4-7 days for someone to reply and will send the occasional 'hi' or 'hey' as a reminder. (Note: I also encourage you to be annoying to get me to reply. Sometimes I get distracted to the point of forgetting to reply or Discord won't send my reply or won't notify me when you reply. Send me reminders. If I ghost you it's never on purpose.) \n\nMUST NOT GHOST. I get being busy or even not wanting to roleplay with me. LET ME KNOW. So many people tend to ghost  when They get busy or dont want to tell me that they're not feeling me or the roleplay. Tell me. That way I know and can have a little closure. \n\nHave Discord.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEXTRA POINTS IF (you do not have to share these but it helps if you do)\n\nYou roleplay LGBT\n\nYou like multiple RPs, multiple characters to be going on at once (I LOVE polyamory)\n\nYou like talking and developing the RP as its happening\n\nYou are okay with rping as/with ocs who are mentally ill or physically disabled in some way. \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSend me a message telling me about you, what you like/don't like in a roleplay, and if you hit any of the extra points!  If you messaged me and I didn't answer I was probably busy! Feel free to Send me another message! I look forward to role-playing with you!! Please send the keyphrase \"Don't ask Don't Pas-tell\" somewhere in your message so I know you read through everything",

If your writing isn't at least semi-literate, I am not going to be able to stay interested in the rp.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u2665  I'm ok writing adult/dark material but I'd prefer it fit into the storyline rather than be the entire plot! (Please let me know what you're comfortable writing!)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u2665  I need a collaborative partner who is willing to work on the setting, scene, NPCs, etc. with me! I hate putting all my energy into the story and not getting the same in return.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u2665  I'd love to write with someone who is down for the long haul! I get extremely emotionally invested in stories. OOC is cool and if we end up being friends, that's a plus for me!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u2665 I ask you respect me/my characters and I'll do the same for you! (Please don't be pushy or a creep!)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u2665 No self-inserts, please!   \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u2665 I write best with those who reply at least once every 1-2 days. Waiting a month+ for each reply kills my interest. :(  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u2665 Romance is great as long as the characters actually vibe together!

In a post-apocalyptic setting, he's simply trying to survive and navigate the world collapsing around him. He keeps a lot of unfortunate secrets.|This character is very angsty and has a lot of dark themes in his backstory. Patience will be necessary to crack open his hard exterior and get to the soft, broken man inside.

Hunters with ill intentions are keeping that from happening.|Your character could accidentally stumble upon her or be a hunter out trying to get her as a trophy for their own.

If you wanna roleplay with me, send me a **writing sample and which plot/character interested you** (if any)! Thanks for reading! :D",

I don\u2019t have a real plot in mind.\n\nNSFW is possible depending on how this turns out as I don\u2019t want it to be forced or the main focus\n\nJust a heads up: I\u2019m quite experienced with discord, however, I only recently installed Kik and I have never chatted on it, and reddit PMs are hard to rp on.

            "selftext": "Hey there,\n\nIf you clicked on this post odds are you like the Elder Scrolls. Or you're weirdly interested in old paper. Either way you've come to the right place! Skyrim was my first foray into Tamriel, but after it I've played ESO and Oblivion and dipped my feet in Morrowind (though I can't claim to have gotten very far there). \n\nI'm looking to kill two birds with one stone and scratch my itch for good RP and Skyrim at the same time. Preferably you've got some experience with the world of Elder Scrolls and know the lore enough to be comfortable. I don't shy away from action, blood, and the grim so I'd have to insist on sticking to my age requirement for everyone's enjoyment and safety. I tend to prefer crafting the story together with my partner and then having both of us pushing it along but I'm also happy to GM for the right person provided they remain a proactive player rather than a reactive who just responds to what they're given. \n\nPrompts:\n\n**The Great War** - Life in the Imperial Legion is tough, especially so when murderous High Elves bent on world domination are slaughtering their way through the provinces. We could play two Imperial Legionaries doing their best to survive in a war torn world. Or anyone else unfortunate enough to be caught up in the Great War.\n\n**Guild Life** - Tamriel is filled with various guilds and organisations. From the gallant Fighter's Guild to the deadly Morag Tong. Two guild members take on their jobs together, forming a strong brotherly or romantic bond on their journeys.\n\n**Pure Adventure** - What more needs to be said? Tamriel is filled with adventurers and there are still thousands of ruins and tombs to explore for riches and fame.\n\n\n**DM ideas**\n\n**Courtly Life in High Rock** - High Rock, and the various Kingdoms located there, is known for courtly intrigue and grand politics. In this idea you would play a minor noble, either having just inherited the role from their parent or having just been awarded with land from a local duke/prince/king. Courtly shenanigans ensues.\n\n**The New Chieftain** - You play as an Orc who has decided to create his own Stronghold. Life as a traditional Orc is hard and he will have to fight for his claim and once settled, to keep it. This would explore the life of the Stronghold Orcs. From the many wives to the alliances made with other local Strongholds and settlements. \n\n\n\nThese are just some of my ideas, feel free to hit me up and we could chat some more. Have your own idea? I'm probably all for it!",

I appreciate good and detailed description and I love to get into the psychology of my character and their emotional depth.  \n\n\nI like to stay open to ideas when I write and I like to do most genres which include (but definitely aren't limited to): Adventure, Slice of Life, Gifted/Powered, Supernatural, Medieval, Fantasy, Sci-Fi, etc.  \nWhen it comes to Romance things I'm cool with NSFW stuff and I prefer MxM &amp; FxF pairings but I honestly don't mind FxM as long as it doesn't pander to typical cliches.  \n\n\nI like discussing plot, details, characters, world-building slightly, and face claims are a must.

I also don't mind how you identify or what gender you'd like to play.\n\nI like to play fantasy (low or high, but high is my favorite), science fiction, and horror, but I'm not averse to other things as long as the characters are adults--that means no high school roleplay, but otherwise go wild. I don't have any particular plot in mind and am excited to hear your ideas! I can do something original, but I'm also interested in something in the universes of Star Wars (EU or canon, and my current obsession is Star Wars so I'd jump for joy at this one), Star Trek, Hannibal, Critical Role, and Game of Thrones. I also don't mind one or both of us playing multiple characters. When it comes to smut, I don't mind it but it's not necessarily what I'm looking for. But if it comes to it, I'm LGBT+ friendly in regards to smut and romance.\n\nI'm flexible with reply length as long as it makes sense for the situation, but I'd like two or three lines at least. I gravitate more towards a paragraph or two. As far as activity goes, I'll try to reply at least once a day, but occasionally I might have to skip a day, as I'm going back to college and will be working soon.\n\nI like to connect to the people I rp with, so let's make friends!

I wanted to make an rp focused on this weird world, except it\u2019s an AU and our characters are from a new company, company 11. I don\u2019t have a real plot in mind.\n\nNSFW is possible depending on how this turns out as I don\u2019t want it to be forced or the main focus\n\nJust a heads up: I\u2019m quite experienced with discord, however, I only recently installed Kik and I have never chatted on it, and reddit PMs are hard to rp on. Therefore, discord is preferred \n\nPm me if you are interested!",

It was her favorite pastime - was. \n\nThe day of Charley\u2019s divine vision was the day the nightmares started. She was too young to remember her mother\u2019s death.

Then one of us swoops in to help them after and then the roleplay can build off of that. We can definitely talk more about it on Discord or Kik. All I ask is that you are a guy, you roleplay in 1st Person, you're literate, and you can be somewhat detailed. I do prefer kik to roleplay but, I am willing to do Discord. If this idea intrigues you definitely shoot me a PM, thanks!",

She was first in line for the crown, however the week before her crowning the king\u2019s newest bride gave birth to a son. Now she is your future bride. She has entered the castle and you are about to meet for the first time. How will you handle these sudden changes\u2026?\n\n\u00a0\n\nI have some more but these two are my favorites.

I have gotten some amazing new roleplays on here thanks to my previous ads, and I\u2019m hoping to now find GMs to help develop some M x M fandom romance ideas I had! Here are a couple I\u2019m looking to fill. They\u2019re fairly general, but hopefully we can build on them when you message me!\n\n1. Big Time Rush\n\n*My character is an up and coming solo artist under the same label as BTR. When the guys see him, they instantly fall for him and try to woo him. Who will he choose?*\n\nThis would require you to play the guys. I\u2019m happy to play background characters. \n\n2. The Bachelor \n\nThis would be the bachelor concept but surrounding a fandom. You would play the guys for my character. We can discuss fandoms!\n\n3. Adventure Time \n\n*Marshall Lee was growing bored since Fionna and Prince Gumball became an item. He ventured off to my character\u2019s kingdom to hang out. Will something more blossom over time?*\n\nThis would be with my OC Angel Prince, and we can discuss dynamics and ideas when you message me. \n\n4. Scott Pilgrim vs the World \n\n*After Scott\u2019s new friend from the moon moves into Wallace Well\u2019s apartment, the flirty guy becomes quite smitten. What occurs is a series of adventures against evil... and romance*\n\nThis is with my SP OC. You would be playing Wallace. \n\n\ud83c\udf83\ud83c\udf42\ud83c\udf41\ud83c\udf4eMY RULES \ud83c\udf83\ud83c\udf42\ud83c\udf41\ud83c\udf4e\n\n1. Please be literate! No bad grammar or text talk! Third person only!\n\n2. Please be reasonably active. No ghosting. I realize life gets busy, however if you only reply once in a blue moon, I am not for you. Please communicate if you\u2019ll be away for a long period of time (I will understand and do the same). \n\n3. You must be 19+. I will not roleplay with anyone younger than nineteen, no exceptions. \n\nI welcome people of all gender expressions, and also check out my other ads too! Thank you for reading and I hope to hear from you soon! Please feel free to shoot me PM if any of this interested you!",

Out of curiosity, we open the package to reveal a small wooden lockbox within. After many failed attempts at opening said box, we continue on with our day and eventually come back to it to try and pry it open with tools. As we do so however, a blinding white light emits from the box and before we know it we're unconscious. When we stir awake, we are clearly not where we were, instead finding ourselves on a cold, damp stone floor with a smoldering torch just a few feet away.\n\nDon't let typical fantasy tropes fool you with this one, I'm looking for a world that leans more on realism. Meaning our characters won't be able to just pick up a sword and be able to swing it with even an ounce of skill. Anything new to us will take us time to learn, and the world definitely won't be waiting for us to catch up. So if this is something you might be interested in or you have some questions, shoot me a PM! (I won't respond to chat requests since Reddit doesn't like to notify me of them)",

However, i\u2019m more then happy to branch off into something more OC related. I would just prefer to play Nezuko Currently.\n\nIf you wish to use just a few sentences or a few paragraphs about your character, or an Image will do nicely. Your own does not have to be Anime, you just have to be okay with mine of course! \n\nOn the other hand, The Canon Character pairings when I do play them, i\u2019m fine with all of them (OC x Canon, OC x OC, Canon x Canon) so you can play who you feel, even if it means crossover. I only do BxG, may I warn too!\n\nLike I said earlier, all the details will be discussed in Private, and I only play on Discord, Wickr or Kik. This can go many ways in terms of plot. May it perhaps be Dark, or Rather Sweet. You obviously may choose what role you have, however if you are unsure we can obviously brainstorm.\n\nMy Rules Are for you to only be able to write more then 8 Lines, or a Paragraph per response is preferable.

And while I won't hold you to the same regard, whether you're a newcomer into rp or just having a rough day, please dont one line me. Any amount will do, just make it feel like you put some semblance of effort into it.\n* I do rp NSFW content though I prefer it appropriate to the situation and not just smut for smuts sake. \n* Lastly I do prefer being an original character vs that of a cannon character though I'm willing to flex and bend on this depending on the fandom or idea presented.\n\nId prefer to discuss one on one about what kind of rp you're interested in, I've done just about everyone of them from Star Wars, to RWBY, to Mass Effect style, to simple medieval rps. And while I am willing to do the whole \"Man saves girl because girl is special,\" theme, I'd like to have my partner be a bit more involved than that. If it's an action scene help me fight, or maybe save me from danger. If it's a political drama, get involved. Don't just sit on the sidelines throwing out one meaningful shout in the middle of court, hoping that will sway and woo the hearts of everyone there.\n\nThank you again for taking the time to read this, or skim it. Hope to hear from you soon.",

            "selftext": "(*Heya! Looking for partners interested in a SFW, Fandom Based roleplay!))*\n\n**Kingdom Hearts**, the lovely series from the great and confusing minds of *Disney* and *Square Enix*.\n\nA series I have been in love with, as long as I can recall. With the release  of the DLC: *Re:Mind trailer,* for *Kingdom Hearts III,* the itch to write something within this fandom has return!Now, when it comes to the series, I have played all the games; from the very first, to the mobile App; though, for the App, I have not been as committed to it, as the other games- but I do watch lore videos on Youtube about the App's story.\n\nEvery other game I have played, and beat though! So, no worries of spoilers, when it comes to discussing. I will say, while on the topic of the games them selves, my favorite in terms of Story/character stuff is: *358/2 Days,* as I love the concepts of Nobodies and the Sea-Salt-Trio. However, the best game of the series, is still probably *Kingdom Hearts II.*\n\nWhen it comes to possible ideas for a story/plot for a Roleplay, I am more than open to bounce ideas back and forth. We could stick to a specific game's time frame, and the characters within, while adding our own little spin/head-canon to things. Completely go in an AU type route, that could go as far as possible away from the Action RPG style game it is, like some sort of School Au with the Organization Members. An AU with our favorite characters on some new Adventure, re-writing events within the series with new changes. And so much more.I have a few snippets of thoughts that I'll list here.\n\n* An AU, similar in style of Final Fantasy X-2, with the female characters on some adventure. So, Kairi, Aqua, Namine, and Xion. (And anyone else we could add into the mix, as well.)\n* This is, as suggested above, some sort of School AU. Saw fan -art once of Sora and Riku in school uniforms and thought it looked cool! So, its an option; though, I might need more than just a school setting.\n* Going into the in between moments, the time when Ansem the Wise was still in Power, and Xehanort and the others that would become Organization XIII( Nobodies), were still under Ansem's teachings. Show the experiments they preformed, and what Ansem taught to them, and the eventual over-take of power, between Xehanort and Ansem.\n* A cross-over, with another game I am in love with; Persona 5!I love the mental image of Sora, Donald and Goofy working alongside Joker and some of the Thieves. (Or just Joker) It couldn't be that big of a stretch to assume a Persona 5 world exists within the Kingdom Heart's universe, right?\n* I have tried this one before, and still very open to the concept;  \nRe-writing events within the series/Kinda like What-If ideas.\n* Or, any thought you may have! Feel free to throw them this way, and we can bounce them back and forth\\~\n\nOh, here's some stuff about myself:\n\n* I prefer third person, past tense, POV. As for Length of posts, that can be vary/be discussed. My general rule: enough to keep things moving, ya know?\n* Platforms of where to write? Also can be discussed in PM's (NOT REDDIT CHAT) here.\n* I live in EST, and work a part time job, so replies might vary throughout the day. IF I am unable to reply for a few days, A message will be sent, explaining so\\~\n* I typically stick to Canon characters, and prefer my partner do the same. I have no problem adding in our own quirks/head-canon to characters; though, OC's can be discussed. Just, know I usually want Canon.\n* Anything else? Feel free to ask!",

I like rapid-fire these days and prefer RPing on Discord if at all  possible! I'm not against longer posts or more depth, though, and tend  to mirror what's given to me.  I use third person, past tense. While I'm  not on every day, I do try to respond at least a couple times when I am  online. I hope you don't mind me needing some time every now and again-  I've got a lot going on! I'm 21+ and would prefer you be the same. I'm  also female, since that seems to be important! If there's anything else  in the generic details that you would like to know about me, please feel  free to message me and I'll get it added on here. (oh yeah, I'm in PST.)\n\nNow, back to what I'm looking for: *Stargate Universe!*\n\n\\-- Not a common fandom, I know, but it doesn't hurt to put it out there, right? I tend to play **Nicholas Rush** and usually prefer **m//** though I'm open to just about anything.\n\n\\-- OCs are fine, but I would really love a **Young** if one's out there. Otherwise, again, I'm happy to interact with anyone!\n\n\\--  I have a couple loose plot ideas, generally AU and ambiguous in the  timeline. I like exploring planets and getting into trouble.\n\n\\--  While I'm okay with RPing with people in other Stargate fandoms, please  be aware I have ONLY seen SGU. Yes, I know, it's the worse one, how  could I like it, etc etc. I like what I like!\n\n\\-- I'm open to crossover ideas.\n\n\\-- I'm looking for a couple partners! So I may re-post this ad. \n\nIf you're interested in a RP with me, just send me a message and we'll get things sorted out. Thanks!",

My history of role-playing consists of magical worlds, celebrity assistants, medieval, wolf shape-shifting (God that was so long ago), and many more.\n\nHere are my current ideas: a few specific a few broad.\n\n1. Kara Danvers (Supergirl) and Cat Grant. This one is very niche as you would have to be a fan of the show Supergirl and a SuperCat shipper. This is my current #1 search.\n2. Celebrity x Assistant (female only). This has been my go-to for a while and has become a favorite of mine. You or I would play a celebrity and the other would be the assistant. Over time they fall in love, keeping it a secret from the world and causing drama within the relationship.\n3. Street Urchin x Sorceress. This one I did once years ago and it never got very far but I loved the concept. The idea is that you would play a sorceress or some other type of magic user. You're known in town for being able to help people with your magic. I, a poor street urchin (dunno why I like that term just do) am your friend who gets caught up in a tangled mess with some dark magic users and need serious help.\n4. Knight (male or female) x Princess. Now, you don't need to play a girly princess if you don't want to. But the idea is that I'm a knight and your personal body guard/best friend. We both have feelings for one another but due to our roles, neither is willing to risk it. Eventually we can't stop ourselves and it turns into a whirlwind romance of desperation and hiding.\n\nI'm also open to any ideas you might want to try and think I would like. I roleplay on here but I prefer discord.\n\nHope to hear from you!",

The Capital is startlingly quiet. Similarly, the other royal children make their choices and publicize which sibling they stand with\u2014Claudia secures the trust of the youngest sister, Jenna, and with it The Academy of Magic nestled in the Aklan Mountains. Eulalia receives the two princes\u2014Ezekiel and Jonathon, the youngest of them all, but sired by the Queen\u2019s current consort.\n\nIlop, Year 359: Eulalia seizes the farmlands around Fort Claimith; soldiers pledge themselves to her, and Eulalia plays nice with the local nobles, allowing them to retain their titles. She promises reform\u2014the war to the north will be called off, education for all, and a guarantee for all to represented under her crown. Claudia is silent.\n\nVlemar, Year 359: Silence. Neither side has moved.\n\nWilbom, Year 359: The silence is broken as forces led by General Perceval, under the hand of Eulalia and the banner of Ezekiel, launches a siege on the towns surrounding the base of the Aklan Mountains, preventing the Academy from receiving resources. It is a kind siege, for what it is\u2014Perceval\u2019s attention is solely on the Academy.\n\nBukog, Year 360: Winter settles in. Claudia moves her forces to seize the remaining ports and conscripts all men between the ages of 16-30, and all nurses between the ages of 14-25. The country reaches a stalemate.\n\nOvag, Year 360: Noble houses begin to pledge allegiance to the princesses\u2014the crown, yet, is quiet; there has been no movement in or out of the capital since Eulalia staked her claim.\n\nBlaurad, Year 360: Eulalia has control of most of the southern border, save for a pocket of resistance against the Harien Harbor. Claudia has the north and the western shore\u2014the east remains untouched behind the Alkan mountains. \n\n\u2014\n\nhello! my name is leu. i roleplay on discord in servers, &amp; use google docs so we can both edit the Lore\u2122\ufe0f (like the calendar), &amp; i also tend to write little side snippets; i prefer it if you are comfortable playing multiple characters.\n\ndon\u2019t worry about face claims or photo references as i myself do not use them. i roleplay in the third person. i don\u2019t care what your gender is or what gender you play. \n\nthis roleplay will not be an in-depth focus on the actual civil war\u2014i prefer my RPs to have a very human characteristic to them &amp; they tend to be more about the characters than anything else, a personal sort of thing. naturally, there will be scenes of the war\u2014segues, interims between scenes\u2014as that\u2019s the back drop, but it is NOT the focus.\n\nyou don\u2019t have to play the named characters in the prompt! but the plot focuses around them, even if we aren\u2019t focused entirely on the war; ezekiel and perceval, for instance, already have a mini plot planned (take a wild guess at what that is). you\u2019re more than free to play a soldier, an aide, someone who unwittingly gotten themselves involved, a nurse, etc.; you can be as big or as large as you please.\n\ni hope to hear from you!",

            "selftext": "Heya! Seeking multi paragraph detail oriented roleplay on a variety of different starters I have. Adult themes are acceptable as long as the detail and effort is there to build up a strong and colorful world. The ideas down below are just barebones themes that I think would be fun to explore. Some involve being non humanoid characters. I\u2019ve added a Star next to my favorites. Unfortunately I must start the roleplay off on messages (not chat) on reddit. In the process of finding an app that works well on my network. If you don\u2019t hear from me I\u2019ll get to you! Thanks!\n\n-Battle royal on a planetary scale. We fight for the right to mine the system for 5 years. Dungeon crawling and traps galore!\n\n-**Feminization as a theme. I have loads of starters for this. You or I can play the male... but one way or another the male will turn female. Usually very nsfw. Ideas include, convention turning you female, friend who wants you to be female at a Halloween party, magic, science based, underwear raid at college gone wrong, loads of ideas. If you are interested ask. \n\n-You get sucked into a fantasy rpg on your computer. I play the npcs and the wizard that presided over all of it. It\u2019s role has a lot of flexibility. Will start with you getting sucked in and an interactive character creation. Loads of possibilities here. Very long term rp!\n\n-** You play a sentient swimmer (\u201cthink male reproductive item. The filter didn\u2019t like the real word for it\u201d)  who can communicate telepathically. I pick you up sitting somewhere. We talk as you make your journey. Odd roleplay but I find it quite fun when I have an imaginative partner. \n\n-I play an anthropomorphic fox girl who starts at a new school. I\u2019m the first girl of my type at the school. Bullies and curious humans all around. Will you be sweet and nice to learn about my people... or a bully to the furry girl. Let\u2019s find out!\n\n-I play a Draenei who started at the local university. Show me around and let me learn about your local customs!\n\n-Space bar type scene. Usually I start my character off as some sort of magical mercenary for hire. All species welcome. \n\n-A story based on \u201cSeeds: A growing business\u201d on an adult story website. Love that story and the idea of a reproductive based plant taking over humanity. Some other stories I like to rp around on that same site are \u201cOlsen\u2019s family dairy\u201d and if you can find it online \u201clifetube\u201d \n\nPhew. I have honestly dozens of starters and ideas and this is a good sample. If you are interested hit me up. Men and women both welcome and I\u2019m willing to play either! Looking forward to hearing from you",

I have other fandoms of course, those can be found in my other posts on this subreddit.\n\nI'm a 21 years old, from the Netherlands and more than willing to play both genders. NSFW content doesn't bother me too much, but I'd like it not the be too overbearing on the rp.

            "selftext": "Hey! You can call me Suki. I\u2019m a Semi Lit to Lit Roleplayer who is currently searching for someone who would be willing to do a Roleplay based of the Takagi-San Anime. I\u2019m only able to play Takagi, however, i\u2019m fine with you playing Canon, which will most likely be Nishikata, if you want to play him, but I assume most will want to play an OC, which is fine! For the sole purpose of this RP, i\u2019m fine with bending the plot and saying certain things don\u2019t exist or didn\u2019t happen.\n\nFirstly, I use Image References rather then describing my character if I ever do so, however, If you wish to use just a few sentences or a few paragraphs about yours, or an Image will do nicely, So please be aware of that. Your own does not have to be Anime, you just have to be okay with mine of course! \n\nOn the other hand, The Canon Character pairings when I do play them, i\u2019m fine with all of them (OC x Canon, OC x OC and Canon x Canon) so you can play who you feel, even if it means crossover. OC x OC most likely will not be Happening.\n\nLike I said earlier, all the details will be discussed in Private, and I only play on Discord, Wickr or Kik. This can go many ways in terms of plot. May it perhaps be Dark, or Rather Sweet. You obviously may choose what role you have, however if you are unsure I have a few suggestions in the back of my mind!\n\nMy Rules Are for you to only be able to write more then 6 Lines, or a Paragraph per response is preferable. Please don\u2019t come to me if you\u2019re looking for a Quickie for other Subreddits are for that sort of thing, however I am always fine with Smut as long as that isn\u2019t the sole purpose of the Roleplay.",

I hope your Monday isn\u2019t terribly dull. \n\nI just moved to a new area, so I have some free time on my hands. ;-; I\u2019ve been role playing on and off for about 8 years. I prefer 3rd person. Life gets busy so I don\u2019t expect frequent posts, but one or two a day is more than fine with me. ^^  \n\nSO I really love medieval roleplays. As well as slice of life, fantasy, and horror. I\u2019m pretty flexible, so if you have a roleplay you wanted to try out lemme hear it. NSFW acts are totally cool, but I typically like a build up instead of jumping right into it ;) \n\nI really love getting to know my partners. Like I said I just moved, so I\u2019m always free to chat or send memes. Thanks for reading if you got this fair! Can\u2019t wait to hear from you &lt;3",

            "selftext": "Hey there reddit, 21+ role player with 7ish years of experience here. Within the past two or so however I\u2019ve really fallen out of it. I\u2019ve been wanting to get back into it though and recently someone showed me this Reddit and I figured it\u2019d be a good new place to try! \n\nSince it\u2019s been a while, I\u2019ll likely give 1-2 paragraphs max for response (unless the writing easily allows for more) and I know my style and grammar won\u2019t be the greatest at first. I also tend to adapt to the length/writing style of who I\u2019m roleplaying with too. I almost always prefer settings with some aspects of fantasy and am most versed with medieval settings, but I am very open to anything fantasy. Romance is not only welcome but somewhat of a must-have for me, at least in a light aspect. Can\u2019t seem to stay away from it, whoops~ Smut is also allowed but only so far as the story allows for a natural flow and unless previously discussed as part of the story, isn\u2019t in the very beginning. I can really only play female characters unfortunately but as I get into practice, making male side characters should be fine. \n\nI also won\u2019t be able to lead much story wise, getting back into the swing of it, so a well established storyline would be awesome to get me going. I do love building worlds though! And for me as a roleplayer that, and building character bonds are the most important and valuable. I do work a lot of hours so my responses will likely not be the fastest, as well as my typing long term on a phone needs work, but I think that\u2019s all points that need referenced! I hope to meet lots of new role players here and find some lovely stories~!",

            "selftext": " Thanks to a bit of boredom and curious of how a Japanese bathhouse is, the idea for the roleplay you see here was made. Thanks to his parents suddenly deciding to do work overseas, a senior high school student has to move in with a pair of childhood friends that he hasn't seen in ages. These two however run a family business:A bathhouse. Along side now going to school with them, he now has to help the two run the bathhouse.\n\nNow in terms of how I roleplay and preferences to partners, I typically do better writing at least a paragraph or two but I can do more if you are up to it. I also find it more fun to play more than one character but that is just me so I don't mind if you just want to stick to one.\n\nNow of course we all do have lives including my own self so if you are busy, do not worry too much about it but do at least give a heads up if something does come up. And lastly please at least be above 18 since I don't want a case on my hands and there could be possible NSFW themes.\n\nFor location and timezone stuff, United States and my timezone is EST.\n\nIf you're interested or have any questions, just message me and I will send you my discord stuff.",

            "selftext": "__Hi everyone and thanks for taking the time to check out my post.__\n\nAs I have found it quite useful in constructing these in the past, I will be outlining the two main characters I have in mind for this idea first, then explain the setting and finally give you an idea what I am looking for.\n\nNow: yes this is a celebrity plot... But before you click or tap away in disgust, I just ask that you read on a little further! Hopefully you'll be convinced that I am not looking to just live out a hare-brained fantasy, but have actually devoted some time to coming up with what I think is an interesting and engaging plot. I have tried this plot with OCs in the past, but whether it is because I first had the idea with Taylor in mind or not, I have never found myself enjoying those as much. So I'm looking only for partners who are willing to play her, at least in name and appearance. __You're of course welcome to make her character completely your own otherwise!__\n\n### Without a voice is a singer still a singer?\n\nTaylor Swift's career had been at its all time high. Her fans ranged from teenagers discovering her music now to the precious late 20s early 30s demographic, people her own age.\n\nEach album an instant chart topper, each single a hit on radio stations worldwide, each tour sold out within minutes of tickets going live. She had it all, money, fame, everything the young girl dreaming of a life in the big cities had dreamed of.\n\nAnd then, one morning she woke up with a cold. as usual her voice was all but gone, her throat sore, her nose runny. Nothing to worry about. Certainly not an affliction that a few days rest couldn't cure. And sure enough the cold went, her throat no longer scratchy, her nose clear. Yet her voice never returned.\n\nShe could speak just fine, sure. But anything any attempt to conjure a tune and an unbearably sharp pain would stab at her vocal chords. Understandably panic ensued. Innumerable doctors, of increasing specialisation and renown, later, she was left with the most infuriating of diagnoses. _\"Idiopathic\"_ The medical profession's fancy term for, \"we don't know what it is, what caused it or how to fix it\"\n\nPanic turned to depression. The machinery of show business kicked into gear and within a month, her label, who had been wooing her with contracts, trying to lock down her next album deal, had liquidated her. Her tours were cancelled, talk show invitations rescinded and soon enough she was well and truly out.\n\nNot that most would have considered her fate truly tragic of course. She had been the single most profitable artist prior to her fall. Her wealth was considerable, even in the hedonistic hills of Hollywood.\n\nYet, with it all gone, she no longer felt at home amongst those who still had _it_, whatever _it_ was. Her music had been her life, even with all the money and fame, she had always loved it best. No longer able to sing her songs, she couldn't have bared to pen them for someone else.\n\nThe decision to leave, to turn her back on her idyllic California estate and the penthouse in New York, took her little time. She had her chief of staff, in what would likely be her final act - for she couldn't see what she's need a staff for now - inquire about suitable accommodation in the one place she'd always imagined she might one day live. England, more specifically, the luscious southern countryside of the home counties.\n\nShe wasn't sure what exactly drew her to that small island across the ocean. She'd visited during her tours of course, but only the larger cities, London, Manchester, Birmingham and the like. Maybe it was the idyllic pictures she had seen or the TV series romanticising that part of the country, but something had always drawn her to the rolling hills of southern England.\n\nSoon enough a number of promising advertisements made their way to her, including a peculiar listing for a country villa, formally part of, but offered for rent separately from a much larger estate.\n\n### _Noblesse oblige_, whether one like it or not\n\nFor most of his life, the heir to Edgerton estate had despised his father, its lord. Had anyone dared to ask why, he likely couldn't have named a single, determining moment that inspired the arctic climate between them. It wasn't so much the man himself he hated, but what he stood for, what he represented: An ancient breed of aristocrats, who, defying the changing times, still clung onto power and wealth in modern England.\n\nThe Edgerton estate was about as old and esteemed as one might find. The family inheriting its name had been its keepers for centuries. Through wars, civil and foreign, throughout the reigns of many a king and queen, the lords of Edgerton manor had held positions of great importance and power.\n\nThe fortune, amassed over the estate's long history - much of it through means looked less than fondly on today - the family enterprise, now no longer in shipping and manufacturing, but the financial markets, even the hereditary peerage granting Lord Edgerton a seat in the house of lords, all remained to this day.\n\nThe son of the man currently reigning over this empire could not have loathed more what he was to inherit one day. In his mind his family represented everything he felt was holding back his country from becoming what his generation wished it could be.\n\nDeep down he knew that beyond this, his disdain for his father was rooted in the man's indifference to his mother, the one creature on this earth he had felt closest to. Until illness took her from him and had him sent away, across the country to boarding school. When he emerged, years later, as a young man, from the wood panelled halls of Eton, he wished nothing more than to leave it all behind.\n\nDenouncing his father's wishes he pursued a degree in the sciences, something the Lord of Edgerton Manor had little use of, or so he was told. Four years at university did much to lighten his spirit. He had almost forgotten the weight on his shoulders, knowing that one day he would be called upon to take his father's place.\n\nHis passion for science, another great treasure university had bestowed upon him, lead him to a career in research. He was three years into his doctoral studies when his old life returned to haunt his soul.\n\nHis father, by no means of old age and of sound health, had passed away to the great dismay of both his household and the English nobility at large. Having always hoped he'd have time to prepare, maybe even find an escape, the son now found himself burdened overnight with his father's privileges and duties.\n\nAfter resisting for a month or so, he soon realised that he stood no chance, one man against centuries of tradition and the fate of many a person in the balance. For while the business was largely conducted with only marginal oversight of the lord, the estate of Edgerton Manor still had in its employ more than a hundred residents of the villages surrounding its expansive lands.\n\nWith a heavy heart the new Lord Edgerton had to abandon his studies and return \"home\". Settling into the Manor and getting a grasp of what would likely constitute the daily routine of his remaining years left him irritable and depressed.\n\nOne of the many unwelcome tasks he found himself settled with was to decide how to handle his mother's estate. The large, country house, situated on the edge of Edgerton Park, the local name for the gardens, lakes and woodland surrounding the main manor, had passed to him when he lost her. His only fond childhood memories were all set in its gardens, lovingly kept by his mother, who was also the heroine of each story.\n\nAfter deliberating for a week, he decided that he could not justify keeping the housekeeper and gardener charged with its upkeep employed if the house was to remain unoccupied. Thus he begrudgingly allowed the property to be listed for rent, under the strict stipulation that any prospective tenant would be carefully vetted by him personally.\n\nIn case someone has wondered, I have (loosely) based the male character on my own experiences going to a painfully posh boarding school and interacting with people (usually parents) from that world. Have you clicked away yet? No? Good! First of all don't worry, I only went to school with those people, I'm not exactly one of them (too poor).  \n\n### The setting (other than \"in England\")\n\nAs the tag indicates, I see this as a slow-burning, realistic romance. Both characters have had a rather bleak time getting to where we would be picking up the story, so there is plenty of development to be had.\n\nI'm also always looking to expand a story beyond the confines of just a single genre. I for example see these two characters helping each other cope with their respective situations. Their new environment and eventual relationship leaves things open for all sorts of storylines to be explored.\n\nI can see there being elements of mystery, intrigue, adventure and much more as the story develops. And it's worth noting that I consider \"long-term\" to truly mean __long-term__. I find that if the story grips my imagination (and I have a good writing partner to scheme with) I will keep having new ideas.\n\n### My \"style\" (or lack thereof)\n\nNow even though I appear to have written a short story about each character, I hope I haven't come across like a dictator. I do in fact highly value world and character building as a team sport. Any potential partner of mine should know that I want to them to feel like they can truly make their character their own.\n\nIn addition to this, I am always happy to discuss ideas and suggestions for additions or alterations to the plot and general universe of the story. After all roleplaying is supposed to be __collaborative__ storytelling!\n\nThat being said I do have a \"style\" that I stick to while writing, so if you are interested, I ask you at least consider agreeing to it as a rough frame. I write in third person, past tense, and usually in reasonable detail and length (who would've guessed huh...). Literacy is rather important to me, so if you enjoy a very fast paced, short reply style, we probably wouldn't match too well.\n\n### Wrapping things up (omg finally!)\n\nFirst of all, if you have made it all the way down here, congratulations and thank you! Give yourself a pat on the back! I do truly appreciate people taking the time to read through my ramblings.\n\nIf you are still around, I take it I have managed to at least slightly peak your interest. (Yay!) If you have questions, suggestions, comments or (constructive) criticism but aren't sure if this is the roleplay for you yet, please don't hesitate to contact me!\n\nIf on the other hand, you've come away from all of this with the firm belief that you and this story are made for each other... same goes, please send me a message and say hello!\n\nI look forward to your messages.\n\nx",

I want to be able to create a server with you, where we can have multiple plots going, that we can jump from whenever we feel like. For romantic pairings, I typically write MxF and FxF.

            "selftext": "The title hero is often overused. People that take on trials for their own personal gain use it, as a way of sweeping their intentions under a thin cover. Others, use it as a title to be revered, and looked up to. Many heroes aren't the genuine article. Most of the time, they are just people, looking to set themselves aside from others.\n\nTrue heroes are often very rare, and very short lived. Well, most of them, at the very least. The primal mages of the Arcanum coast...well, they're a bit of an enigma. You could ask almost anyone in the kingdom about them, and you'd probably get a smattering of theories of what they are. Some will say primal mage is just a title, taken up by the next person in the line, others will say they're immortals, slumbering away until they're needed again. But out of all the theories, one bit of information is constant. The mage of storms was a coward, and abandoned his companions when they needed him the most.\n\nMost people sneer when that title is brought up. Even more so when people have the gall to utter \u201cStorm Raven\u201d, rather than boil it down to a simpler, more insulting title (although that was about as far as anyone could take it). What he did to earn that vilification wasn't exactly known, either. Most just left it with what they knew. Probably because it was the easier of the alternatives to accept.\n\nMost people wouldn't dare digging into his past. It would only be met with nasty looks and various other unsavory things. A few people were crazy enough to try and hunt down what happened, though.\n\nWho knew? Maybe someone would find the elusive \u201cStorm Raven\u201d slumbering, in some unmarked shrine, waiting for his companions to wake him up once more.\n\n)(\n\nAnd with that brief introduction, allow me to start this off with a brief explanation. This is, obviously, a fantasy rp, set in the country of Arcanum, aptly named because of all the magical happenings that fill the land. I'm planning on making this a rather expansive world, with plenty of lore and mysteries sprinkled in (if the above starter wasn't any indication). \n\nWith that, some ground rules. I'm looking for an 18+ partner, that can keep up with posts around 2-5 paragraphs. I am planning on some romance being included, hence the 18+ requirement. Other than that, some action and drama as well, along with three dimensional characters, all that jazz.\n\nI'm awful at these closing notes bits, so honestly, if I've caught your interest, shoot me a PM. Please add some detail in your introduction, **I can't stress this enough.** We can definitely work something out. Before I leave, though, I'll ask that if you do message me, put the word stormcloud in your message- it helps me know you read the entire prompt.",

I\u2019m female, but I can play either male or female roles. I can do almost any genre as long as the plot is interesting, but these are the ones I\u2019m most interested in: science fiction (particularly cyberpunk), horror, and historical. But right now, I\u2019m mostly interested in historical settings (the 20th century, but the 1940s/World War II in particular). It\u2019s not a requirement, but I\u2019d like to include a romantic element if possible. I\u2019m also really interested in a potential horror scenario inspired by Lovecraft. I\u2019m 18+ and can do NSFW scenarios, just as long as it actually benefits the characters and/or plot. My replies tend to be shorter, around 1-2 paragraphs, I hope that won\u2019t be a problem. I also prefer to write in third person.",

            "selftext": "Good evening there folks! In the past week or so, and with some help, I've gotten myself re-familiarized with the ins and outs of being at least a decent DM! Though, I find myself still seeking a few more partners to create stories with, and was hoping that some of you would be willing to tag along with me for another adventure!\n\nThat being said, I'm also more than happy to do some 1x1 stories, with either of us controlling the aspects of the world as we go!\n\nI'm more than happy to spin a tale on any of your favorite genres, though the ones that I tend to specialize in, or are at least most experienced in, are fantasy and apocalyptic themes! Still, I hope that doesn't discourage you from pitching anything else! I'm more than happy to work with anyone in order to make a world together that we can both enjoy, as well as any story!\n\nIn addition, here are some fandoms that I'd be **stoked** for us to play in:\n\n- Fallout series \n- TES series\n- Red Dead Redemption (Yeehaw!)***\n- Fable series\n- Kingdom Come\n- Witcher\n- The Last of Us (Or any zombie related game, really) \n- Metro series\n- Rainbow 6 or For Honor (interested to see how either of these might go.\n- Many more!\n\nOr just some regular settings/genres:\n\n- 1800's Western\n- Fantasy (Anything from high fantasy to medieval and Roman era settings)\n- Some kinda of military operations group/ team (Call me biased, would really like one like this.)\n- Post Apocalyptic\n- Horror\n- Many More!\n\nOf course, I'm also open to \"borrowing\" the world of whatever your favorite fandom might be, with some sparse exceptions! Video games, books, movies, etc, just let me know and we'll see what we can do!\n\nAs for my preferences on things, I prefer my partner be mostly literate, (I'm not perfect either, of course! Just someone that grasp things well enough!) Over the age of 18, and understanding of schedules! I'll never be on to get upset if you have to go all of the sudden, though if you feel the need to cut things off, please let me know! \n\nMy only other stipulation is that you please be willing to work with me. I understand, it's my job as a GM to come up with the world, but it's really hard to do so when my partner isn't willing to put the same effort into things! If we feel that things are bland/ dying, then I'm happy to work with things to revitalize it, or even drop it.\n\nLast topic to cover, I believe, is the possibility of smut occuring in the story! As stated above, I'm pretty familiar with it, and are totally fine with doing it at any level that you're comfortable with, or not at all! If need be, we can discuss those preferences, likes/ dislikes, etc later on!\n\nIf this interests you, please don't hesitate to shoot me a message! I'm taking on about as many as I can handle without sacrificing any attention to any of my potential partners!\n\nPlease, have a great day!\n\nAlso, if you've reached out to me before and I disappeared or didn't respond, please feel free to hit me up again! I had bit of a debacle with my Discord and Reddit as of recent.",

My name is Annie, I am a twenty-one-year-old female from Northern Colorado. I hope I don't come across as close-minded and mean, I'm just getting a little picky. \n\n***Roleplay Genres and Other Notes -*** I'm only interested in doing long-term roleplays at this point. I tend to do a mixture of Romance, Drama, NSFW Aspects, and Action/Adventure. I like to discuss plot points and ideas before we implement them, just to make sure both of us think it will be a good idea. I do not want to hear other ideas at this time, I'm sorry.\n\nAs the title says I'm seeking a Canon x OC Roleplay for Good Omens with my OC against Aziraphale or Crowley. I haven't finished the show yet due to watching it with a friend and having to wait for her to be available. \n\nI have a couple of ideas but obviously we could set this before the show.",

Think of this as a short story, where a lot of narrative heavy lifting has to be done over a shorter scope.\n\nI prefer a fantasy or soft sci-fi setting. My general rule to avoid extensive time world-building is that the world is as you describe it; so if one player describes a rule of the world during play (\"Magic users are common and accepted in society.\"), this would be honored in the fiction as a fact. We can zoom in and out on aspects of the world and setting as we see fit. \n\nI am open to NSFW themes, but it is not mandatory for me to enjoy the roleplay. If we do explore NSFW themes, I expect you to be 18+ (as I am also 18+). Otherwise, I don't care about your age or how you describe your \"literacy\" so long as you are able to match my writing. \n\nSome themes I'm interested in exploring during play: internal self vs. performative self; alienation from the body (through illness, aging, acquired disability, etc.); whether the ends justify the means. \n\nHit me up with a Reddit DM and if we jive, we can exchange Discord info.",

I\u2019m in PST and I\u2019m mobile a lot so in turn I like to chat OOC and be friendly with my partners. As well as build our character relationships etc. You don\u2019t have to be a male writer specifically but someone who will write for a male character. \n\nI\u2019m looking to write with 18+ as I enjoy writing smut in my stories. Please don\u2019t ghost. Let\u2019s build worlds together and come up with plots together as well. That being said I have no issues with the characters being younger. I also like to write anywhere from 1-3 plus paragraphs depending on the scene. \n\nFirst, I\u2019m looking for a Peter Parker to my Michelle Jones. I\u2019d like to follow as canon as possible but of course take creative licence. I am open to all MCU ships though and I don\u2019t mind doubling if needed. \n\nI also like Harry Potter. \n\nSecond, I\u2019d love some OC plots as well: \n\nModern day princess/bodyguard \nMedieval/historical fiction \nHigh school/university romances\nAnd I\u2019m open to much more. \n\nIf this sounds at all interesting to you please DM me!",
