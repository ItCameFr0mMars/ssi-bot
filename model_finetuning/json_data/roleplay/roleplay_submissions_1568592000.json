            "selftext": "As the years passed, she began growing weary. Every season, stricter regulations were imposed on magic users in general. Every couple of yeard, a new discipline of magic was declared heretical and persecuted. Users of holy magic and basic elementalism were generally considered to be safe from the witch hunts, for not only were they too widespread to be persecuted, but also too prestigious to oppose openly.\n\nHowever, smaller and less popular disciplines of magic were swiftly vanishing. Without the numbers or reputation to meaningfully oppose the witch hunters, necromancy and divination were nearly wiped out in the realm.\n\nNow necromancers live nomadic lives in the outskirts of the kingdom, working simple jobs and letting their magic slowly atrophy over time. Most of them have accepted that their time is over, and that death in the end does claim all \u2014 even knowledge.\n\nLina is not quite like most. Maybe it's her pride forcing her to keep learning and teaching, maybe she's just resolved to keep going out of spite... Whatever the reason might be, she's still active and she refuses to let her secrets die with her. Of course, finding students is rather hard nowadays and she can't really afford to be picky.\n\nShe's taught a few people before, none of them really magically talented. A few wandering ogres that strayed too close to the kingdom's edge, a couple of street urchins she felt compelled to save... One or two might still follow her around, but she's not done looking yet. \n\nNow, would you like to be apprenticed to the wandering necromancer?",

            "selftext": "Ghosting has pretty much ruined roleplaying for me which I find very sad and infuriating because I used to love it so much. It's gotten to a point where I am almost afraid to really get attached to the stories and characters because I just know that at some point the other person might just disappear. Recently I got very into this story that we had together and for the first time for the longest time I was actually super excited to rp again and I thought that maybe I had finally found a partner that really just... clicks. But then suddenly without a warning they just completely stopped responding. I've seen them online but they just don't reply to anything that I say and I must admit I probably completely humiliated myself by talking to no one but myself but I just really loved this story. I didn't lash out or anything, just asked questions and so on and I probably looked pretty desperate lmao. The thing is, this really made me depressed. I know it's nothing but a hobby but I couldn't help crying my eyes out when I finally accepted that I just most likely got ghosted again because I just felt so inadequate. I love writing, I love creating characters but now I just feel that maybe I am not that good at it? Maybe my ideas are bad but people just don't say it to my face because they're polite and then quietly ghost later? Idk, I just feel really disappointed and needed to rant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Anyone else feeling like this?",

            "selftext": "Hlan, the great trading city that sat on the coast of the Twilight Sea, was nearly in sight and it was as more frightening then anyone could have imagined...\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nThe journey to Hlan had been an interesting one, and one that not many people experienced in their life. Hlan was the furthest west that most maps recorded, and some people say it sat at the edge of the world. Aliya had set out from the Jiziran Free States, which were a collection of culturally and linguistically similar nations on the southern most part of the continent of Almania. From there she sailed west aboard a merchant ship, and passed by many of the more exotic and interesting places of the world. But where most people would have stopped Aliya kept sailing west, and things only became more and more strange. \n\nAs their vessel approached the Twilight Sea the waters became a swirling mass of black and purple threatening to hypnotize even the most strong willed of individuals. The captain advised Aliya not too stare too long into the waters lest she wanted the Sleepers to turn her mad and hurl herself into the suffocating waters below. Needless to say Aliya kept her distance from the edge of the boat from that point on. Despite the terrifying nature of the Twilight Sea the waters were as calm as a rocking chair, and the soothing sound of the gentle waves threatened to put her to sleep. The captain said that the Sleepers did this on purpose so they could subjugate entire crews into unconsciousness, and then climb aboard their ships to steal their people away to underwater prisons. All along the joinery Aliya dared not ask who, or what these Sleepers were, but they surely couldn\u2019t have been real.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nHlan rose like a series of great black monoliths out of the thick green jungles that surrounded the city. It sprawled so massively along the entire coastline that one wasn\u2019t even able to see where the city began, and where it ended. But the jungle had overtaken much of the city, and now only a few enclaves here and there served as settlements and trading ports for the few brave souls who dared to live here. Hlan\u2019s architecture was jagged, foreign, and alien to anything Aliya had ever seen before. Non-Euclidean geometry served as the basis for most of the city, with only a few buildings resembling structures that she recognized, but those buildings seemed new in comparison to the ancient constructs surrounding them. Aliya stood on the edge of her boat, nearly trembling from the sight of it all, but she kept as much composure as she could. The port was the most lively part of the city, and there actually were a fair amount of boats coming to and fro the great black granite docks of Hlan. Some were simple merchant ships, and others looked like fully functioning war galleons, but even with all these ships much of the port remained empty waiting for boats that would never come. Aliya fixed her cloak, and finally was able to break her gaze from the alien city that stood before her. She\u2019d best go find her companion so they could tackle this city together.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n(Just an example of how I write)\n\nHey everyone. My names Danny and I\u2019ve been on the lookout for a new partner or two for a while now. I know lots of people are busy nowadays, but hopefully we can find sometime to develop a really fun and interesting story that satisfies any cravings we might have!\n\nA little about me. I\u2019m a 22 year old girl from the East Coast United States and I just started my last year of college. I\u2019ve been roleplaying for quite a while now, and I think I\u2019ve gotten pretty good over the years. Most of my experience came from internet chat rooms and playing dungeons and dragons!\n\nI roleplay in the third person, typically write in a paragraph format, and enjoy lots of descriptors of settings, emotions and everything. I like it when I can really sort of picture the scene in my head and maybe also feel what the characters are feeling.\n\nI enjoy mostly any kind of roleplay. I mostly do medieval fantasy, and although I still think it\u2019s my favorite genre by far, it can get a bit stale after some time. So I\u2019m really looking to do any other sort of roleplay that you may have in mind as long as it meets all the requirements I laid out. But after saying that I have been craving a more darker/gothic medieval fantasy roleplay. I like NSFW themes, actions and settings as long as it\u2019s not the absolute focus of the whole roleplay.\n\nThat\u2019s about everything, hopefully I hear from you and we can work something out. I\u2019m usually on Discord, but if that\u2019s a problem I\u2019m totally willing to move to a different place! Thanks!",

I would also like to thank you personally for clicking on my post, and taking the time to read through it. \n\nTo get into the juicier portions of everything, I\u2019ll first tell you who I am. My name is Joshua, I recently turned 20 years old, and I have been writing for around 7 or so years. I\u2019ve been around the block some could say, but there are other people on here that blow me out of the water. Nevertheless, I am capable of writing multiple paragraphs (oftentimes exceeding the 2,000 character limit on discord), writing grammatically correct and scholarly sentences, and providing true character development. \n\nAs far as roleplay goes, I want someone who is committed to creating a story with me. I ask for this because I have been ghosted a number of times, and it\u2019s painful when you\u2019re really into the story. I\u2019d love to write about romance, slice of life, horror, action, etc., etc., or any combinations you might want. Overall, I just ask for literate partners that don\u2019t flake out on the first day. If something is wrong, or you\u2019re not feeling it, let me know so we can talk about it or separate mutually. \n\nThat aside, please be 18+ when contacting me as I do enjoy including NSFW features. I have a few ideas in my head that we can talk about, and I\u2019d love to hear all of yours as well! If you\u2019ve read this far, please put your favorite color in your title. Lastly, thank you for reading, I really appreciate it and I can\u2019t wait to get writing!",

She furrowed her brow as the bright flames met her emerald eyes. Her face was locked in a stern expression as the heat from with white-hot metal met her skin. A bead of warm sweat dripped from the back of her neck and trickled down her spine. Her skin glistened from the warmth on the room. She could taste the salt on her lips. The messy bun on her head kept most of her curly strands out of her face. Her baby hairs stuck to her skin as she scrunched her face from a sudden wave of heat. She was a blacksmith first, before everything. Charley took pride in her work. It was her meal ticket. A blacksmith for hired had to be able to prove themselves quickly and efficiently. \n\n Charley gripped tightly on the handled of the hot blade with her small hand. She slowly dipped the blade into the water as it began to boil. With her free hand, she wiped the sweat from her face.  It was laborious work, but she took pleasure in it. Whenever she was in the forge she was at peace. \u201cAlmost done.\u201d She said to herself.\n\u2014 Charley walked the blade back to the owner. \u201cI fixed the crack that had begun to form and I sharpened her back up for you. She\u2019s as good as new.\u201d She sported a grin as the man graciously thanked her for her work. \n\nCharley stepped out from the smith shop and into the baking sun. She pulled her gloves off soaked hands and sat them down inside of her leather apron. Her beige tank top soaked from sweat started to dry in the sunshine. Charley closed her tired eyes as she leaned against the wooden pole of the smith shop. The sounds of bards could be heard faintly from the tavern walls. The smell of the forge filled her nose as she listened to the sounds of the busy town. The cool breezes danced in her curly locks of hair. The smell of the forest was carried in the wind as it cooled her warmed skin. She waited calmly for the next customers to arrive as she leaned against the wooden pole.\n\n-----------\n\nHey there! I'm looking to have a fantasy romance roleplay for my character here. You don't have to play a nonhuman but I think it would make for an interesting pair if you did. I'm open to ideas and I have several plot ideas ready. If you're interested please send me a PM.",

            "selftext": "First of all, a bit about me. I am an experienced, mature RPer who has a number of years of experience in different formats, including face-to-face, email, forums and the like. Primarily, I am interested in character interaction and development, especially through storytelling, conversation and relationship building. I like to see well developed, well thought out and believable characters. I prefer exotic or unusual settings, primarily science fiction, cyberpunk or post-apocalyptic. \u201cReal world/slice of life\u201d scenarios aren\u2019t that interesting to me; if it's something like a military or espionage setting, maybe, but not something 'mundane'. With that being said, I\u2019m open to ideas if they\u2019re original or creative or a little unusual.\n\nI generally like well-written, well thought out posts, and definitely prefer quality over quantity. I don\u2019t want to read a novel with each post, but I don\u2019t want to see one-line-wonders. Similarly, I am a stickler for grammar and spelling and punctuation, although I am prone to the odd bout of ferocious typos myself. However, as long as the intent is there, then I\u2019m happy.\n\nMy interests lie in mutual storytelling and creativity, rather than playing along to somebody else\u2019s story or the like. I control my character, I decide what\u2019s going on with them, I create their background and so on. I ask for my partners to respect that, as I will do the same for them. Likewise, I will never launch a major story element or a plot twist or the like without okaying it with a partner, as I would expect them to do the same for me. If I do something a partner doesn't want, then I'll gladly change it, but I ask that they will do the same for me.\n\nI\u2019m flexible as to settings and backgrounds. I am currently looking for **Sci-Fi**, **Cyberpunk** and **Post-Apocalyptic** RP in original settings. I am also interested in fandom RPs based on **Star Wars**, **Battletech/Mechwarrior, Shadowrun** and **Fallout**, but only using OCs. I am **only** looking for one-on-one RP, not groups or Player/GM experiences.\n\nIf you are interested, please contact me by **PM**. I will not reply to messages posted here or chat requests.",

            "selftext": "Hello there, dear reader!\n\nAs the title suggests, I am in search of another partner to work on and, of course, play out a fantasy story.\n\nI don't have any specific thing in mind but am open to ideas and do have a few not yet fleshed out plot ideas I'd love to have a look at with somebody equally minded.\n\nA little (much) about me:\n\nI am 26, live in the CET time zone (Please, don't go!) and do have a full time job, so I won't always be available around the clock. During holidays it'll be quite a lot more - so as you see, it fluctuates.Usually I will be able to get out at least one, probably even more posts out a day.Post lengths do vary, but can easily jump between two paragraphs to five, depending on what's going on.I value detail and descriptions in writing and ask that you try to use proper grammar as well - although I of course won't rip anybody's head off for some mistakes, especially if you're tired or have a lot going on next to writing. It sure happens to me now and then.\n\nThere won't be any smut in my roleplays, so if that's a deal breaker for you, I wish you all the best and good luck in your further hunt!\n\nI absolutely adore any kind of fantasy, it has been a long time favourite for some years now. It doesn't matter if it's set in modern or medieval times, as long as there's a lot of room to further imagine and add things, characters, countries... and so on!Romance and adventure are cherished, but so are a bit of horror and mystic. Thinking of it, something in a similar style to the Dresden Files would be great - or even some cliche arranged marriage plot in medieval times. Heck, I could see cliche plots of that kind in modern times as well!\n\nMy main characters are usually female, but there's always more and more other characters joining in, some I've had for a long time and some I've recently thought of that could fit in.\n\nI admit to being chatty and I love to OOC with my partners if we mesh well, be it about the story itself, hashing it out further or even just about the weather, work... whatever.Since I adore it's server system, I currently solely use Discord.\n\nOh dear, I'm babbling on again, don't I? Sorry about that.Have I sparked your interest? If so, PM me and we can look more into it.\n\nHope to hear from you!\n~Lynne",

I\u2019d really love to have a story I can draw around; scenes and character designs etc. If this doesn\u2019t interest you than it might not be a good fit.\n\nI consider myself an advanced writer and world builder. I write *third person, novel style*. I\u2019ve been writing for over 10 years and roleplaying for most of that time. I consider myself advanced Lit and I write novel style, 3rd person, past tense. \n\nI like character oriented action and adventure but of course with a smattering of romance. I am comfortable writing as both genders and doubling. Currently looking for M/F or F/F pairings. \n\nI love fantasy settings and I\u2019m especially in the mood for world building in a high fantasy world with an advanced writer who is willing to bring effort to the story. I am a real life dnd GM, definitely appreciate my RP background helping me out with those skills! But I don\u2019t want to GM a role play, let\u2019s make it collaborative!\n\nIf you made it this far I hope to hear from you!",

One of us is about to get married, when we meet eachother. There\u2019s an immediate sense of \u201cwhat could have been\u201d after we meet and this feeling only intensifies as we keep making excuses to meet up. Lots of drama with the other partner (that you or me just married) and themes of regret, lust, and passion.\n\n2. Medieval theme \u2014 looking for a classic prince/princess forbidden love, or some other relationship that is looked down upon. Themes of medieval values, perhaps war, kingdoms, geography and other medieval problems.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019re interested in any of these plots, or one of your own and let me know what your discord is. Oh! And I\u2019d love to know a little about you before jumping in. \n\nI\u2019ve met some incredible people on this subreddit and really looking forward to hearing from you :)",

            "selftext": "Hello all! I've decided to go on a hunt for some roleplay partners. First, a bit about myself. \n\nI am a 20 year old girl who loves to create characters of all kinds and act out roleplays that are funny, romantic, and worth the time invested. While I do have my moments of business or tiredness, I am pretty free most the time. I roleplay in 3rd Person and my personal favorite genres are slice of life and/or modern fantasy mixed with romance. I'm not too picky on length but my comfort zone is 2-15+ lines depending on my level of creativity and how much the other person puts out. I do prefer LGBT roleplays although I can do straight roleplays. I prefer our characters to be able to change out on the who wears the pants role or for me to be the lesser pants wearer. Most of my characters are less masculine  or ambiguous. EST Time Zone.\nNow onto preferences for my partner. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMUSTS: \n\nMust be willing and able to have or create a decently fleshed out character. I have a character template that I use for my ocs if you need one. Character tropes are fine, although I take some issue with some but as long as they go beyond that trope and are their own person beyond 1 or 2 character traits, they're fine!\n\nMust have decent grammar and spelling. Now I know nobody's grammar or spelling is perfect, but I need to be able to understand what you're typing. \n\nMust reply at least every other day. I understand being busy and having times where you can't reply for a few days but id like to be notified if and when those things happen. I usually wait 4-7 days for someone to reply and will send the occasional 'hi' or 'hey' as a reminder. (Note: I also encourage you to be annoying to get me to reply. Sometimes I get distracted to the point of forgetting to reply or Discord won't send my reply or won't notify me when you reply. Send me reminders. If I ghost you it's never on purpose.) \n\nMUST NOT GHOST. I get being busy or even not wanting to roleplay with me. LET ME KNOW. So many people tend to ghost  when They get busy or dont want to tell me that they're not feeling me or the roleplay. Tell me. That way I know and can have a little closure. \n\nHave Discord.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEXTRA POINTS IF (you do not have to share these but it helps if you do)\n\nYou roleplay LGBT (Admittedly I enjoy RPing MxM most- so even more points in that case!)\n\nYou like multiple RPs, multiple characters to be going on at once \n\nYou like talking and developing the RP as its happening\n\nYou are okay with rping as/with ocs who are mentally ill or physically disabled in some way. \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSend me a message telling me about you, what you like/don't like in a roleplay, and if you hit any of the extra points! Make sure it's a message and not a chat/comment as I typically don't answer those as often.  If you messaged me and I didn't answer I was probably busy! Feel free to Send me another message! I look forward to role-playing with you!! Please send the keyphrase \"Don't ask Don't Pas-tell\" somewhere in your message so I know you read through everything. I probably won't respond otherwise.",

That means I am very busy: there will be days when my brain will be fried and served with pickles.\n\nIf you add my frequent pauses and bouts of grief to the above, you will see why I'm looking for those who understand that I am not able to deliver novella type posts. For me, a writer can describe feelings and actions in a few words, and this is what I seek right now. Meaningful but laid back realism, having fun, being able to relax. Also looking for a lot of OOC discussion about the story itself.\n\nPlease be at least over 18, because mature themes will surely arise: not as a form of compulsion, but as an organic part of the story.\n\nAdult women are what I am looking to play at the moment, in MxF relationships. Romance and Drama are vital for me, as moving, evolving character studies of some sort. I am not interested in Anime or Furry, sorry about that.\n\n**I have been having major issues with my inspiration lately, so you can hit me up with things you love and we can see if we could come to an agreement. I'm looking to follow, not lead, if possible.** \n\nFANDOMS\n\nThe Godfather\n\nMarvel Cinematic Universe\n\nORIGINAL\n\nModern Realism\n\nLow Fantasy\n\nHistorical Fiction  \n\n\nThanks for reading all this and I hope to hear from you soon!",

            "selftext": "**Requirements**: 18+ in age, no exceptions. Literate. F/F romance with nsfw themes. Third person. One paragraph reply minimum, ideally as long as it\u2019s something to work with, we should be fine. I tend to write para/ multi-para. I use Discord with a separate server. The only other platform I will use is Google Docs. I like worldbuilding, details, relationship and character/plot development, so if you\u2019re not into contributing to that, please look elsewhere! \n\nThis rp is meant to be built from a collaborative world that we create, and not limited by modern interpretations of witchcraft and/or any organized religion or belief system. \n\n*\u201cGrowing up, the stories of her stature always ended the same; a cautionary tale at best. A death sentence at worst. You are flawed to perfection, and, regardless of the precise nature of your wounds or your identity, you still know her. We do not always find her in the light, sometimes we find her in the dark. We find her in the places that terrify us; we find her in the places they told us not to look.\u201d *\n\n**Summary**: Many years ago, witchcraft was bountiful in the land. It touched every part of life, from the plants in the ground to the teachings passed down with a sort of wild ferocity. People from all over would seek identity with the forest, but it was nothing compared to what one could learn from an experienced witch. They were often sought out for guidance, knowledge, and power among other things. Their expertise being generally highly valued throughout society. \n\nOver time, the ways of the world slowly gave way to a new type of power wielded by those born with a mage\u2019s brand. This power from the mage\u2019s brand was more structured, easier to bend to the laws of the land. Preferred by the governing bodies as the new way of rule, many people began to shift their interest from witchcraft and pursued other paths to wisdom. \n\nYou are one of the last High Witches in the land, a title bestowed to only the most powerful. \n\n**Prompts**\n\nMc &amp; Yc are my character, your character respectively.\n\n\u2022  [MC] is born with a mage\u2019s brand and well-versed in the knowledge of mage\u2019s power. She belongs to a small group who are uneasy about the rate at which witches seem to be disappearing all around. She had to find out why, even if the rumors were true, and seeking out [YC] meant she was forced to pay a price. \n\n\u2022  A few rogue elitist groups of mages began hunting the last few pocket communities of witches. [MC] escapes a village slaughter from one of these groups by fleeing into the woods. Our characters eventually happen upon each other. \n\n\u2022  [MC] seeks out [YC] to teach her the ways of the wild. [MC] soon learns that her hands may be made for magic, but her mouth was made for something else. \n\nYour climb to power and expertise is your own. You choose your magical gifts and disciplines and the way in which you became renown to your community\u2026 or not known, maybe hidden away? Your story is your own, and I am not here to limit you creatively or god-mode your character(s). These are just examples of where we could go.  \n\nI want to flesh out ideas for this world with you. I don\u2019t have much in mind for my character yet besides the fact that she\u2019s kind of compliant with a strange hunger for knowledge. I\u2019m still working on other plot ideas and would love to brainstorm together, but keep in mind I am looking for strong F/F romance with a healthy dose of nsfw adventure. However, it doesn\u2019t have to be instant and would prefer it not be the main emphasis. I\u2019d like to explore themes like dealing with intense emotions\u2014\u2014 anger, fear, dread, falling in love... without the need for pointless drama. I want to feel the strength in your dominance shake the trees to their roots. I want to taste the salt in your resilience. Let\u2019s build sacred magic together and watch as nature bows down before you. We will rise up, to answer your call of the wild. \n\n*\u201cTo be heathen means to belong to the wild, to take our lessons from the natural world, and to be nourished by what we fundamentally are; rather than what we are told we must be.\u201d*\n\nIf this sounds like something you\u2019d be interested in, please send a private message! \u201cHey, can we rp?\u201d type of messages are kindly ignored. If the post is still up, it\u2019s still open. Thanks for reading!",

I'm female myself, and your real life gender doesn't really matter too much. I do find it easier to RP with other females most of the time, but that's not a rule.\n\nBefore I get into the plot, I'll go into the boring stuff:\n\n\\-18+, 21+ is even more preferred.\n\n\\- Discord only. I don't RP anywhere else these days.\n\n\\- Third person only\n\n\\- Quality over quantity. I don't want one liners, but I don't want every post to be a book, either.\n\n\\- Relatively active, and looking for someone who is also active. One post a day is the bare minimum. Things happen in real life, and that's totally fine, just let me know, please. Someone who can make a few posts a day is even better, but that's not totally necessary.\n\n\\- NSFW. This is **NOT** necessary to be in the RP, we can fade to black, ect. But it's not unwelcome. Regardless, smut will never be the focus...That should be a given by now.\n\n\\-OOC chat. I like to talk to my RP partner, weather it's related to the RP or not, so someone who also does that is welcome.\n\nI think that about covers it, so onto the RP its self:\n\nI'm totally willing to collaborate and exchange ideas for this, as most of it isn't super set in stone.\n\nMy character is going to be a full fledged medium. ie; can see, talk to, and interact with spirits and such.\n\nYour character is totally up to you. Weather they're a medium as well, a 'ghost hunter' or other kind of paranormal investigator type deal, or just someone who is fascinated by the idea. Maybe they're just a regular person who gets caught up in it. It's up to you, really, and I'm not going to be too particular on what you do with your character. They are your character, after all.  \nHowever, for the sake of my characters' preferences, it would be better if your character isn't the androgynous type. My character prefers the more manly type. Doesn't have to be some big burly guy, but you get my drift, hopefully.\n\nI want this to be a slice of life/romance of sorts, but obviously, given the nature of my character, things that are normal for him, aren't exactly quotidian for the average person. I have more details about my character, but won't go into all of that here. He's an older character of mine, who I've revived, redesigned, and have been wanting to use again recently.\n\nSo, if you're looking for a semi-spooky, strange, and even kooky fun type of slice of life/romance RP, and made it this far, you came to the right place.  \nDM me with some info about yourself, how you RP, and we can have a chat.",

I like slice of life stories with mostly-human ocs in a modern-day setting, and I don't like using canon characters. Little elements of fantasy/sci-fi are fun, I have a few characters that are demigods/partially nonhuman or something, but I don't utilize that aspect very often. I tend to play girl ocs. I'm willing to RP whatever sort of relationship.\n\nI haven't rped since 2015, but I used to like to kind of \"reset\" worlds once everything was wrapped up to see how pairings worked themselves out if things were changed in the characters childhoods (for example, one has nurturing parents in this life, or another is disabled in this world). So in a way I mostly just used the same characters in a lot of different AUs? Large overarching plots and long stories are also nice, I just don't know if I have the foresight for those to work out cohesively.\n\nI do really like NSFW elements, but I don't really like some common nsfw terminology, so I write it a certain way where it's not cringy to me. I have certain preferences that aren't too off the wall, especially to anime viewers, but we can discuss that before anything crazy happens. Mostly, I like playing with power dynamics.\n\nAs an RP partner, I would likely be very active, and I'm an artist, so if I really like your ocs you might get some perks! I can provide some examples of my solo writing to show what I'm sort of looking for. As far as ideas, I usually just like to kinda throw ocs together at first and see what happens, until I get a feel for them. It can be awkward, but that's how real life is! Or ideas are cool if anyone happens to have them.\n\nPlease PM if interested, I'm excited to meet you!",

I prefer my partners to be 21+ as I often include some NSFW themes and prefer to work with Male/Female pairings.\n\nI am okay with some SRP moments but would rather they just be instances between the characters as opposed to the whole plot.\n\nSpeaking of plots some of the ones I have briefly thought of:\n\n- Vampire: Markus was once the prince of the vampire clans until a group of vampiric nobility overthrew the monarchy, killing his parents and exiling him. He must now live life as an exile with the hope of one day reclaiming what was stolen from him. (This is pretty much a basic plot point and I'd be willing to work, tweak and improve on it alot with prospective partners. No preference on what your character would be, i.e vampire, human, or some other mythological race)\n\n-Open to any fantasy themed rp and willing to talk and create plotlines \n\nMedieval is the preferred setting, however I'm very flexible and can work with any sort of setting.",

            "selftext": "The Fantasy Sandbox is a collaborative, medieval-fantasy story writing and world-building game in which all players have an equal input to the story and its effectively crowdsourced setting. This creates a unique, community-designed but cohesive roleplaying world and experience that allows a vast number of different fantasy themes in one place. You can play as any character or race--a king, a knight, an adventurer, a petty criminal, a mastermind villain, a commoner, a wizard or mage, a dragon, a fairy, you name it, provided they are presented in a medieval fantasy theme. Every character has a unique role and contribution to the game. In this freeform roleplaying setup, players create all the civilizations, stories, characters, and world geography within a casual rule set that maintains balance. As a result, interwoven stories emerge. The game world depends on that very emergence and has been developing its identity from a completely blank slate over the course of two years.\n\nThere's no telling who of the many currently active characters you'll meet or where you'll go. Player-designed factions have formed kingdoms, player-written quests drive entire adventures, and politics shape the land.\n\nThis has always been an open community game. If you like to roleplay in medieval-fantasy themes, we invite you to join us in helping maintain our novel continuum alive with new characters, plots, and settings!\n\n[***http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/5/introduction***](http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/5/introduction)  \n[***https://discord.gg/cb5n63C***](https://discord.gg/cb5n63C)",

            "selftext": "Hey! I'm an experienced role player whose looking to play with the theme of arranged marriage. I like the idea of two people going into an arranged marriage looking for the best, but also having to balance the fact they do not know each other at all, and the fact that they have to do this for duty. \n\nI'm interested in exploring it in several different ways, perhaps something historical, dealing with royalty and cultural issues as well as the pressure to have perfection in court as they're getting to know each other and dealing with all of that. The worries and intrigue of two recently at war countries brokering peace through marriage and those two young people having to deal with their own issues regarding the other country while trying to provide an example of peace. \n\nI also like the idea of looking at it from a more  modern  viewpoint, of two children of the elite who in order to keep their trust funds have to marry to cement a business deal, a way of merging companies that doesn't have as much oversight. Two modern people dealing with the fact that they thought the power they had through family wealth was absolute finding out how tied they are to their family as well and having to grow up and become a part of that, or figure out what else they want to do. \n\nI'm also interested in seeing it in the Harry Potter Universe, I would love to play against Draco Malfoy in an arranged marriage with an OC of mine from a pureblood wizarding family that's more muggle friendly and they've been arranged to help the business but also to help rehabilitate the Malfoy's image and the two have to deal with all of that, and being able to kind of explore the pureblood world after the war and as everything is settling down.\n\nI've been roleplaying for a long time (Over 10 years) and love playing original characters, I'm also down to do doubling, if you have a character you'd love to play in a situation like this. I do really like having a female OC that I play but am open to playing another character against a character for my partner!  I normally play on discord, and work weird hours but do try and respond when I can!! I also understand that most of us have lives outside of Roleplay! Please PM me if you're interested in talking out some plot ideas!",

As for what I\u2019m looking for, I\u2019m not clear on what I\u2019m looking for plot-wise, but I can tell you this: \n\nI love romance, and it\u2019s a definite must, whether it\u2019s FxF or MxF, and I always play female. I\u2019m into drama, action, dark themes, supernatural, slice of life, horror, adventure, and pretty much all of the above. My imagination has troubles when it comes to fantasy and magic, though. \n\nSome loose ideas I\u2019d like to try out currently are:\nMafia/gang.\nFBI,\nEspionage,\nSports related, \nROMANCE in everything! \n\nSome fandoms:\nThe 100,\nPeaky Blinders,\nThe Vampire Diaries, \nSupernatural, \nQuantico,\nThe Society,\nAnd maybe a few more \n\nThose are just a few, but I\u2019m welcome to any ideas or plots you may have. \n\nLet me also mention this: I\u2019m not looking for a sex-based roleplay, but enjoy including it into the story as it fits, with an appropriate build. \n\nMy preference for style is 1st person, but I can do 3rd as well. I don\u2019t care about post length, and think a paragraph is just fine. I cannot find 2+ paragraphs fun, as I feel like it hinders the partners\u2019 abilities to move the story along. Although, when starting a new roleplay I can definitely see where length is necessary. It\u2019s just easier to bounce off of replies when they\u2019re shorter, especially with dialogue. \n\nIf you have any prompts, plots, or ideas you\u2019d like to discuss or roleplay, send me a message so we can get to creating something together. I hope you took time to read this, I tried to keep it short, so if you have any further comments/questions, message me! Thanks, Bailey.",

I am a 23+ years old female living in Europe who loves building worlds, creating complex characters and meaningful stories.\n\n  \nI write in past tense, 3rd person and I consider myself literate. My average post length is around 3 paragraph because I like to be descriptive, I like to tell what is in my character's mind, what are the surroundings. I just like detailed, longer posts. Of course, if the plot requires or there is a conversation going on I'm fine writing only a few sentences. I play only female characters as Ocs but I can play side characters as well.  I am looking for a long-term, dedicated roleplay partner preferably 23+ years old, who invest as much energy as I am into the roleplay (one of the biggest red flags is no investment) and who is somewhat active. While I don't expect your life to be revolved around the roleplay (roleplaying is still a hobby that should be fun for both parties) I expect at least one reply in two days. I know life can get busy if you throw me a message that is totally fine but if I have to wait 5 days for a reply I'll lose interest.  \nI am looking for someone who is creative and helps to brainstorm, moving the plot forward with me, not only reacting to my last reply.\n\n  \nPlease be literate and write in paragraphs too. A note I might add is that English is not my first language so expect minor mistakes although I always try my best.  I can get emotionally connected to the story if it is good, meaning that I sometimes send memes, music that is related to the current plot.  \nAs for themes and genres I like character development, action, adventure, horror, stories that could go dark from time to time. Romance is also fine as long as it is not the focus of the story. I only do FxM pairings.\n\n  \nWhat I am looking for (oc x oc):  \n\n* Fantasy \n*  World of Warcraft  \n* Harry Potter\n\nI think talking in OOCly is a must. For a better experience, I tend to talk about the plot with my partners. I prefer roleplaying in Discord, but if that's a problem for you we can move to other platforms. One more thing, I like honesty. If there is something that bothers you or want to stop rolepalying it is fine, just tell me. Trust me, it is better than me worrying about what I messed up in my latest reply.  Thank you for reading, if you're interested please send me a message. Introduce yourself, send me your ideas, preferences, have some energy!   \nHave a nice day!",

If interested in hearing more send me a PM and we can see if we would be a good fit.\n\nThanks!",

            "selftext": "Hello everybody! Borderlands 3 just dropped the other day and in lieu of this fact, I'd love to do a Borderlands RP! \n\nSo about me, I'm 21, and I've been doing a bunch of RPs for about a decade. And when my RPing comes to be part of a well established universe, I do all I can to research that universe! I'm a huuuge nerd for lore, and Borderlands happens to be one of my favorite games! So I'd like someone semi-knowledgeable as well! I like to believe I have no limits, so come one come all! I can play either male or female, and anything in between. My length of text varies based upon the context of our current roleplay, and is also very reactionary. Meaning chances are my responses are shorter but will be more about the character interaction rather than a long post of things they do before we hear from the other side. \n\nAnd with that out of the way, what I'm looking to actually RP! I feel this will get NSFW real quick (just the nature of the game) and as such would prefer my partner be 18+. I'm looking to play either an OC, or any character I feel comfortable with. That being said, I'll play most people, and frankly have no idea for a prompt, but would love to come up with one with y'all! \n\nSo if any of this interests you, please drop a message and we'll see about kicking something off if we click! Hope to hear from you all!",

            "selftext": "Good evening there folks! In the past week or so, and with some help, I've gotten myself re-familiarized with the ins and outs of being at least a decent DM! Though, I find myself still seeking a few more partners to create stories with, and was hoping that some of you would be willing to tag along with me for another adventure!\n\nThat being said, I'm also more than happy to do some 1x1 stories, with either of us controlling the aspects of the world as we go!\n\nI'm more than happy to spin a tale on any of your favorite genres, though the ones that I tend to specialize in, or are at least most experienced in, are fantasy and apocalyptic themes! Still, I hope that doesn't discourage you from pitching anything else! I'm more than happy to work with anyone in order to make a world together that we can both enjoy, as well as any story!\n\nIn addition, here are some fandoms that I'd be **stoked** for us to play in:\n\n- Fallout series \n- TES series\n- Red Dead Redemption (Yeehaw!)***\n- Fable series\n- Gears\n- Kingdom Come\n- The Last of Us (Or any zombie related game, really) \n- Metro series\n- Rainbow 6 or For Honor (interested to see how either of these might go.\n- Many more!\n\nOr just some regular settings/genres:\n\n- 1800's Western\n- Fantasy (Anything from high fantasy to medieval and Roman era settings)\n- Some kinda of military operations group/ team (Call me biased, would really like one like this.)\n- Post Apocalyptic\n- Horror\n- Many More!\n\nOf course, I'm also open to \"borrowing\" the world of whatever your favorite fandom might be, with some sparse exceptions! Video games, books, movies, etc, just let me know and we'll see what we can do!\n\nAs for my preferences on things, I prefer my partner be mostly literate, (I'm not perfect either, of course! Just someone that grasp things well enough!) Over the age of 18, and understanding of schedules! I'll never be on to get upset if you have to go all of the sudden, though if you feel the need to cut things off, please let me know! \n\nMy only other stipulation is that you please be willing to work with me. I understand, it's my job as a GM to come up with the world, but it's really hard to do so when my partner isn't willing to put the same effort into things! If we feel that things are bland/ dying, then I'm happy to work with things to revitalize it, or even drop it.\n\nLast topic to cover, I believe, is the possibility of smut occuring in the story! As stated above, I'm pretty familiar with it, and are totally fine with doing it at any level that you're comfortable with, or not at all! If need be, we can discuss those preferences, likes/ dislikes, etc later on!\n\nIf this interests you, please don't hesitate to shoot me a message! I'm taking on about as many as I can handle without sacrificing any attention to any of my potential partners!\n\nPlease, have a great day!\n\nAlso, if you've reached out to me before and I disappeared or didn't respond, please feel free to hit me up again! I had bit of a debacle with my Discord and Reddit as of recent.",

            "selftext": "Thought I\u2019d give the search another go! Before I get to the plots, the partner stuff:\n\nI typically write one to several paragraphs per post. It varies depending on what\u2019s happening in the scene. I prefer to write in third person perspective and I use Discord as a platform to RP on. I\u2019m fine with romance as long as it\u2019s not forced and not the entire focus of the plot. \n\nI ask that my partner has a grasp on grammar, punctuation and writing. Be 20+ in age seeing as the ideas I have can lead to tense, dark situations. Also, be collaborative please. It\u2019s no fun if all the story plotting is left to one person\n\nDown below are plots (in order of interest):\n\n- Detective Stories: Our characters are detectives tasked with solving murders. Either the story focuses on one big case or several smaller ones. Focus would be on the cases and their effects on our characters and their relationships.\n\n- Are we the bad guys?: our characters are villains from separate universes that are thrown into a series of different stories where they interrupt and ruin its storyline. Hard to explain but a fun random idea.\n\n- Highrise: Based on a manga, our characters wake up in a strange world filled with skyscrapers. There\u2019s no way to reach the ground and most of the buildings are connected by bridges. People that find themselves in this world are hunted by masked killers. Our characters have to find a way out or meet a very grisly end. \n\nI\u2019m open to other possibilities if you think we might work something out. If these plots interest you, please message me with which specific one or a plot of your own in mind. Anything else may go unanswered. Thanks for the read!",

            "selftext": "As the title suggests, I'm looking to start a Star Wars Roleplay. The story is set in the EU/Legends era, some time during the Yuuzhan Vong War.\n\nAs this is my first RP in a couple of years I would appreciate someone with a little patience. I should be back in the swing of it soon. I'd like this RP to be quite detailed, visual aids and wiki links are appreciated and encouraged.\n\nThis roleplay is meant to be diverse, I'm not looking to box in the story and would encourage discussion on how the story will play out. I'm open to a romantic element but it's not required.\n\nStory:\n\nThe New Jedi order... it's members are spread thin throughout the galaxy, the Yuuzhan Vong are decimating the galaxy as they make their way in from the Helska system, blazing a trail of death, destruction and Vong forming, the New Republic is stagnant and the Jedi Order is losing members by the hour, officially, the Jedi are peacekeepers and have nothing to do with the war.... Unofficially, they are on the front lines, driving back Yuuzhan Vong advances, Breaking spearheads, helping the wounded and generally just holding the tide back while the citizens of the unknown regions, New Republic and independent, are evacuated. My name is Kiltaire Donas, I am a Human Jedi Knight, and you will be my friend, also a Jedi Knight, we will be on a backwater planet in the unknown regions fighting off the Vong in an attempt to break their advance down a particular hyperspace route that could lead directly into the core worlds. I'm a more than competent swordsman and adept in the ways of the force, my master used to say that I'm a quick learner and that anything I see I can instantly remember and replicate, which apparently is what makes me a deadly opponent.\n\nThe story begins with us on the backwater world (names TBC) just waiting for the Vong, we're leading the preparations for  the coming battle... or as some of the soldiers have dejectedly called it... the coming massacre. We're just about finishing up the retrofitted skyhook/orbital defense platform when the Vong fleet arrives...\n\nPlease PM me if you are interested and we can discuss the nitty gritty.",

On the way to the curb, you note with displeasure that your front yard has two-foot wide bootprints running across it. Sounds like it's time to complain to the HOA again about your neighbor, the Ettin, and their habit of cutting through yards.\n\nInside, you open the paper and turn to the local news. There's an article about an upcoming blood drive sponsored by the Friends of the Needful, to provide nourishment for the town's vampire population. \n\nThere's also an op-ed by an agitated citizen arguing against The Facade, claiming that now is the time to go public and stop hiding from the rest of the world at large. Looney. There's always a few of them.\n\nYour kid comes down and asks what's for breakfast and you inform them that eggs and toast are on the menu. They complain that the Glitterbell kids get to eat honey and nectar shakes, and you counter with explaining that faerie physiology is different, so, sorry Charlie.\n\nCarpool arrives and it's off to work. Your coworker, Bob, mentions that he's been dating a half-demon girl, and things are getting really hot. You decide not to comment on that, or the suspicious looking burn marks. To each their own.\n\nAs you enter the office, your ears are assaulted by the horror that is Dwarven War Chants on the shared radio. Apparently Churnog got to work first and got his mix-CD into the system. Good thing there are ear plugs at your desk. It's definitely a Monday.\n\nMonstertown USA is a Discord-based RP server set in Potterstown, Oregon, a place where, due to bizarre cosmological twists, weird and supernatural creatures live side-by-side with their human neighbors, and agree to a shared veil of secrecy known as The Facade. Come find your place in the stories with us!\n\nhttps://discord.gg/GUjx8dn",

However, as I\u2019m mid-twenties I ask that you be 21+ as well; simultaneously you must be LGBT friendly, no ifs ands or buts about that.\n\nI post anywhere from 2-6 paragraphs a post, and post two or more times a day. I\u2019d like if you can do the same \u2014 Short replies immediately make me lose interest, as well as replies happening only once a week or less. I realize that life gets in the way, though, so please tell me if you\u2019re gonna disappear! I\u2019ll do the same.\n\nMore often than not I fade to black with smut \u2014 writing it is awkward to me, but sometimes I\u2019ll do it if the characters are getting saucy and we are both really feelin\u2019 it. \ud83d\ude0e\n\nI\u2019m a huge shipper and love fluff. I love romance. It\u2019s mandatory, even if it\u2019s slow burn. It fuels me!\n\nAlso \u2014 I love talking and joking with my partner. I want to be friends. I like playfulness and friendship. If you\u2019re going to respond to things I say with \u201c lol :)\u201d and only care about talking about the rp, don\u2019t even bother!\n\nSome the tiny plot bunnies in mind:\n\nRoyalty vs. Rogues: A large colony of rogues take over a fledgling kingdom\u2019s castle and holds them hostage. Amidst the strife, your royalty and my rogue begin to get along (spoiler alert: they REALLY get along after a while)\n\nEscort: Your character, be they royal or not, has some importance and requires an escort to watch their back as they travel across the continent to a grand meeting or counsel. Hijinks ensue.\n\nIf you have any ideas or are interested, please PM me with some info about you and a sample reply. Thanks!",

I work a full time job and can generally only reply during the evening times once I get home from work. I need someone okay with that. Plus I'd love someone who is up for chatting! Some days I'm to tired to reply and just wanna talk. So if you love that then awesome! A few things before I get down to the obvious bits\n\n* Please be 18+. I like a few adult themes in my roleplay, including smut and prefer to roleplay with someone of or above the legal age limit.\n* Be able to write at least a paragraph. One liners drive me nuts!\n* If you're gonna be gone more then a few days, please let me know! It's fine if you have to go for a while, I understand...but just let me know! \n\nAs for what I'm looking for I'd love, love, love you if you were interested in an MxM roleplay, specifically Harry Potter related. I'm really looking for a Draco x Harry pairing. I generally like post war/post Hogwarts setting, anywhere between 3 to 5 years after the war has happened, we can discuss what Canon stuff we want to stick with related to post hogwarts stuff before we start the roleplay! I'd also really love to play Draco, but i'm not super picky and could play Harry!\n\nDespite the fact that I'm looking for someone more on the chill end of things I would like that you be able to write well. Basic grammar and spelling and no one liners if at all possible would be great. I don't need a novel but a good few paragraphs would be awesome!\n\nThat a pretty much it! PM me if you're interested and put a little detail about yourself into your message, don't just ask me if i'm still looking/interested. Thanks!! =)",

            "selftext": " \n\n\"Rise, Sir Edgard.\"\n\nThe king's words, clearly and powerfully spoken echoed in the vast royal chamber. The words hurt the man, though he showed no signs of it. It wasn't the sound of the man\u2019s voice, strong albeit a little effeminate, that caused such pain. It was the meaning behind them.\n\nEdgard, a name the man rarely heard, had spent the last five years of his life on the battlefield, cutting down the king's enemies like a farmer harvesting wheat. There they called him Orph (short for Orphan) a name that was as reverent as it was derogatory. It was rumored he had earned the nickname as a child by murdering both of his parents.\n\nThe large, brutish man had grown up on the battlefield and become accustomed to it. Now, dressed in shiny plate armor and satin, he felt as if he might suffocate. This was his life now. He had been promoted to Captain of the King's personal guard. With the advancement came the title of Knight, access to the King's table and servants, and recognition, none of which the angry warrior had ever asked for.\n\nThere was awkward applause as Orph stood and faced the court. It was apparent that he did not belong there. His rough, dark features and stubble lined cheeks made him look like a bear stuffed into a royal guard's armor. A weak bow was given and the few attendees who had bothered to show up began to leave. Clearly they saw this for what it truly was: The king was granting the title of knight on an animal because he wanted Orph his a guard dog.\n\nOnce he was dismissed, Orph made his way to the barracks and began climbing the stairs to his new quarters. A guard stood at attention and saluted him as he walked by but it was fear he saw in their eyes, not respect. Part of the man wanted to reject the promotion but he knew that it was death to return a King's gift no matter how ridiculous it seemed.\n\nIt wasn't as if Orph hated the ruler. King Alonzo was regarded as a wise but eccentric ruler. There were many whispers about his strange interests and sinful desires. However, most of the nobles ignored these unsavory character traits. The king had built an army and united the three kingdoms into one. Finally, it seemed like there was going to be peace and profit for everyone who had served faithfully during the war.\n\nOrph reached the door to his quarters and shouldered it open. Inside he was greeted by a nervous, older woman who began bowing impulsively to him.\n\n\"S-sir you're back early. We've just finished cleaning up for you...\" the woman said as she stared at the ground submissively.\n\n\"Cleaning up? What are you talking about?\" Orph grumbled. Surprises normally failed to please him.\n\n\"Well, sir, your uh...oh my...your bride to be, sir.\" The woman began to wring her hands into her apron.\n\nOrph stopped and looked at her. He smelled lavender and lemon in the air and heard the sound of women fretting in the bathing room.\n\n\"My bride...?\" He whispered suspiciously, as much to himself as to the woman.\n\n\"Right, sir. From the king himself...\"\n\nOrph\u2019s thin lips pressed into a frown as he grumbled wordlessly. It had come to him through whispers that the king was unhappy with his new captain's unwed status. It was obvious that he intended to marry the man off to help make his appointment seem more respectable.\n\nThat might not be so bad...but if the king had selected this new bride personally then there were reason for concern. Edgard knew of the man's eccentric taste. He dismissed all the servants and made his way to the bathing room with heavy booted footfalls...\n\n(- Hiya. Been a long time since I've RP'd and I'd like to make this a long term story that starts a little rough but blossoms into a romance. \n\n18+ players only please!\n\nIf it wasn't obvious from the story the king obviously has odd taste. It is your choice as to what that EXACTLY means. I\u2019m open for discussion.\n\nDetails can be discussed privately.\n\nI prefer to play on Reddit but I can also play on Discord. -)",

            "selftext": "Hello there!\n\nI am currently searching for long term RP partners for some interesting RPs.\n\nA little bit about me:\n\nI am a 20 year old female with about 7 or 8 years of experience and even longer writing experience (~9 or 10). \n\nEST time zone\n\nI RP third person and my responses range anywhere from a paragraph to even a page depending on what is happening in the RP.  (I also do try to match responses, but my responses also tend to be a bit detailed and on the long side)\n\nIf for some reason you grow bored or disinterested please do let me know and we can fix it or try something else completely. \n\nI love chatting outside of RP whether it be about our characters, future plot points, coming up with characters in AU\u2019s or just general chat! Although if that\u2019s not your thing then no worries!\n\nI do have a full time job and have responsibilities after so my responses may be dependent. Often times it can get a bit overwhelming so I apologize if my responses get a bit spotty here and there.\n\nFor fandom RPs, I can do canon and OC characters (although I am more used to canon), and I can play both males and females. I also love to RP multiple characters (more plot devices and interaction that way) Character interaction, development, and world building is a must! I love building things to it\u2019s full potential. \n\nAlso, I do quite enjoy looking at characters from different angles even if that means switching between character POV in the RP, but if you\u2019re more of a one or two character interaction type of person that\u2019s fine, but I certainly don\u2019t mind playing side characters or extras to bring the world to life.\n\nSome games I have played: (I am perfectly fine to play against an OC for any of these!) \n\nI will put asterisks next to ones I am inspired for or that I know the most about.\n\n\nDetroit: Become Human *** \n\u2014&gt; I can play any of the canon characters but at the moment I am most interested in a Gavin and RK900, and I could settle for anything with Hank and Connor even including an OC if you preferred as well. I also have several plots in mind for this one.\n\nSpider-Man (PS4 2018) \n\u2014&gt; Canon\n\nFinal Fantasy (4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10-2, 13, 13-2, 13-3, 15 and Kingsglaive, Dissidia, Crisis Core) \n\u2014&gt; I can play any of the canon characters from these as well! **\n\nTales (Berseria, Xillia, and Graces f) \n\nLegend of Zelda (MM, TP, WW, SS, BOTW) **\n\u2014&gt; Canon or OC\n\u2014&gt; I do have a plot in mind for something BOTW\n\nTelltales The Walking Dead \n\u2014&gt; I do have a plot for this one\n\nFire Emblem (Awakening, Warriors, Fates, Three Houses) \n\nThe Last of Us (or similar universe)\n\n\nShows/movies:\n\nMarvel\n\u2014&gt; most movies including Spiderverse and also daredevil, not so much comics \n\nSherlock * \n\u2014&gt; Canon\n\nMiraculous LB *\n\u2014&gt; Canon or OC \n\nRWBY \n\u2014&gt; Canon or OC \n\nSword Art Online Arc 1 &amp; 2 (more the universe)\n\nSword Art Online Season 2 (more the universe)\n\nStranger Things ***\n\u2014&gt; I do have a plot for this one\n\nIT *\n\n\n**Not a complete list of fandoms**\n\n\n\nOriginal ideas I enjoy: (Plot and character ideas depend on your preferences)\n\n\u2014Fantasy (medieval, magical elements, kingdoms, different races, even adding in tech like airships, modern weapons, and exploring more than one and a variety of aspects as well. There\u2019s so much more I could add but it would take forever.)\n\u2014\u2014&gt; war themes, royal themes, different aspects of life themes, pirates, bandits, etc etc etc.\n\n\u2014Romance (MxF and possibly FxF and I don\u2019t do smut. More of a fade to black sort of person) I also thoroughly enjoy building it up over time.\n\n\u2014Action/Adventure\n\n\u2014Angst/Drama\n\nI am sure there are more things I am forgetting. \n\nI would be fine exploring any other sorts of themes/plots genres except Sci-Fi and Slice of life (normal themes would need some convincing as I find it difficult to keep it going) as I like some sort of magical or fictional aspect to it. I can be persuaded depending on the plot.\n\nIf you have any other suggestions/ideas/plots/settings as to what you would like to do then please shoot me a PM with a bit about you and your interests and we can discuss! Give me a bit about your interests and preferences! I am open to nearly anything!\n\nIf you need a sample of my writing, please do not be afraid to ask! \n\nMy platforms are Kik, Discord, Skype, Email, Google Docs and Reddit PM",

Well look no further. I will GM you your dream adventure.\n\nPerhaps you'd like to crawl through ancient tombs, looking for treasure, or travel around space, meeting aliens. Perhaps you'd like to be a player, going to bars to pick up guys and girls, or you'd prefer to be a king or queen of an ancient magical kingdom. Everything is possible, and I will do almost everything to make the adventure amazing for you. All you need to do, is put a little faith in me ;).\n\nI prefer doing it all through Discord, but I am willing to do stuff here as well, and willing to dicuss other platforms.\n\nWhen you message me, please tell me who you are and what your dream adventure is.

What I mean by that is that the plotline will be entirely original, as well as some characters, but most of the important names will stay the same. In this roleplay, you (Princess Zelda) end up summoning an alternate version of your hero, Link, who was killed by Ganon. But the version you end up summoning is quite different in the sense that he's no hero at all! He looks different, speaks differently, and care about nothing besides himself. What would you do in this situation?\n\nSo feel free to use any version Zelda or even a Zelda you've made up on your own! I'm allowing tons of freedom with this one since I mainly just want to do a roleplay that follows the clich\u00e9 \"Hero and Princess\" plotline.

I prefer NSFW in my stories, so if you're not into detailing that, I'm not for you! I'd prefer to play the female to your male, but I'm content to do MxM as well!\n\n\u25aa\ufe0eLife in Exile - A solitary King, self-exiled in power over his tiny country, finds a documentarist crossing his borders. She's trying to bring her crew in to expose his regime and the civil war his people are embroiled in. If she can get to the Royal Palace and jam her thumb under his hard shell, she thinks she'll have a great story. All the while, the King rules from his secluded palace, carelessly tossing laws left and right without ever bothering to truly see what's happening outside his little world save for whatever he passes by on the internet. (Loosely inspired by Far Cry 4)\n\n\u25aa\ufe0eSmall-town Sunrises - Paul and his daughter have muscled their tea house into a new location in the cozy town of Smithdale. They may or may not only be operating as a front for some shady dealings in the back, but they certainly won't admit that outright. All the while (mayor or rival business owner? Sheriff?) has been trying to lift the lid on their operation. What he hasn't expected is to find that wily daughter of Paul's so oddly charming.\n\n\u25aa\ufe0eWild West - out in the wilderness, nestled in the woods, there is said to be a commune of what the locals call \"Ferals\". That being, they can't drum up a nicer name for these people they've never seen up close. The \"feral\" Denfolk court like birds, building shiny displays to attract their mates, and several men and women in town claim to have been lured away by these Denfolk to their nests in the woods only to come back thoroughly debauched. Nobody's ever seen proof of these displays, not until he stumbled across one on the treeline just outside his ranch, and saw the muddy woman there, staring at him across the field.\n\n\u25aa\ufe0eSiren Song - The lighthouse keeper had heard tales of sirens singing on the sea, luring men to their deaths. Countless times he'd watched people stumble past his house and throw themselves right off the cliff, but he never heard the songs that they clearly did. Tonight, he hears it, out there on the water, beckoning him over the cliff to the foam, but what his caller hadn't expected is for him to survive the drop.\n\n\u25aa\ufe0eFandoms- Far Cry 4 &amp; 5, LOTR, Elder Scrolls, Pushing Daisies, The Arcana\n\nIf you've made it this far, pop me a DM with the word \"Toebeans\" somewhere in there so I know you've read the whole thing and not just the title!",

            "selftext": " \n\nWelcome to Salem! (Which one? Yes, the witch one!) Where the slogan is 'Keep Salem Weird' and we Salemites definitely uphold that. Salem is in two parts! There's the mundane (muggles, no-majs) part where all the non-magical humans live, The Lords of Salem (a religious group who wants to eradicate magical creatures of all kinds) and The Knights of Salem (Not to be confused with the Lords, they're the good muns that work with the Coven) live here too.\n\nOn the other half behind the veil is \"magical\" Salem where you can let your freak flag fly. You are protected! This is where Salem Preparatory Academy of Excellence resides (or for short Salem Prep. Go Dullahans!) This is where the Salem Coven (ruled by two families) pulls a lot of the strings as well. Have a question about the veil? Go ask Salem's oldest member the Headmistress of Salem, Kirkland! Be sure to bring a memory! Strange things are definitely afoot at the Circle K.\n\n\ud83d\udd39The goal of Salem is to provide roleplayers with a quality and level of roleplay and storylines not found in other communities. We hope to keep stories fresh and to tailor storylines in a way that each player feels important in this RP universe. Here are some rules and general guidelines to consider before immersing yourself into these story lines.\n\n\ud83d\udd39We accept writers of any level of experience as not everyone who's already in the server is extremely experienced but we want to keep it fun for everyone.\n\n\ud83d\udd39We follow Wheaton's Law.\n\n\ud83d\udd39We prefer writers who are 18+ although the server is entirely SFW.\n\n\ud83d\udd39We are LGBT+ friendly to both writers and characters. We have no tolerance for discrimination.\n\n\ud83d\udd39If you are interested, please contact me and we can have a chat in case you have any more questions before ultimately joining the server.\n\nWe hope to see you in Salem soon!",

I am also not opposed to modern fantasy settings or anything involving a bit of mystery.\n\nI do have several worlds built in my head, as well as an arsenal of characters I'd love to share with you if you are interested!\n\nI prefer to work through email or Google docs, but I do have Discord (still learning, bear with me!). I live in the US in Mountain Time, and I do have a full time job that takes me away from things occasionally. I promise I would keep you in the loop if I get backed up or can't reply in a timely manner!\n\nI prefer F/F relationships, but I am willing to give anything a try! I tend to stay away from NSFW writing, but if the story goes that way then again, I'm willing to try! I prefer to write in third person and past tense, but I'm not a stickler for anything having to be paragraphs long every time.\n\nShoot me a DM if you are interested?",

            "selftext": "In the year 2077, mankind had begun their march into the final frontier. First setting up colonies on Mars, then building a super city in the sky on Jupiter, followed by other colonies on Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. The technology was flourishing, nations were merging into super nations to bring eternal peace, and Humanity was thriving at its very greatest in its history. It seemed as if there was only opportunity for greatness for mankind... that was until everything changed in the blink of an eye. \n\nOn June 19th of 2057, two small asteroids had collided with Phobos and Deimos, both of them too small and fast for anyone to anticipate, only knowing of it seconds before when the asteroids came in eyesight. They were only about the size of a small house each, however, illuminated a very bright cyan. This was odd for sure, however, upon further investigation, a bizarre discovery was made... The two moons began to not only change, but they also began to merge.\n\nWithin the span of 50 hours, the two moons had slowly become a bright cyan and begun to close the distance between themselves before colliding and merging into one moon. At first, this was dismissed as an astronomical phenomenon with no effect on daily life, until weeks later when creatures began spawning from the caves of the surface of Mars. \n\nDefeating these creatures for years became a chore. High powered weapons had to be developed and used to defend Mars, and even eventually other planets as well when these creatures dubbed 'voidlings' begun appearing on Earth, Mars, Saturn, and Uranus. The situation on Uranus was so bad that the entire planet was overrun and had to be abandon. By the year 2082, it appeared that humanity was going to become extinct as we knew it... Until the gifted begun to surface.\n\nAlthough this dubbed 'Solar Void' was cursing lifeforms, it was also gifting humanity as well. For unknown reasons, people with powers begun surfacing left and right to fight off the voidlings and defend their planets. Within months, situations were quickly restored. Although Uranus was permanently lost, the rest of the colonies became stable once more... and then the age of superheroes begun!\n\nThis is where you come in! Since the surfacing of the gifted, all the worlds and their governments formed the U.C.R.G (United Colonial Regulation of the Gifted). This organization set several rules and regulations for heroes to follow, as well as several branches for them to serve. There was the hero program for those who wanted to defend the innocent, the purgers for those who wanted to hunt the void, the punishers for those who wanted to hunt down gifted people who turned to evil, and then the scouts who wanted to explore the depths of the final frontier to find more planets to colonize, and to find the source of the Void. \n\nHowever, before all of this comes the academy! Several academies on earth were set up by the first and greatest heroes so that they may pass down their knowledge to the next generation to ensure the universe is in good hands. \n\nWill you become the next big hero? Will you fight evil? Will you help defend the innocent against the void? Or will you join the next generation of explorers? The opportunities are endless, however, before all of this comes the academy! Several academies on earth were set up by the first and greatest heroes so that they may pass down their knowledge to the next generation to ensure the universe is in good hands. \n\nAnd with that, your journey begins on the first day of your first year at the First Battle Academy for the Gifted...\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n##Hello there! If you have read this far, then thank you for taking an interest! If you want to learn more about this RP then shoot me a pm on reddit, however first note these things:\n\n1. This roleplay involves you making a character sheet with stats. No rolls or stat checks are involved, its just a way to balance characters and organization of them as well. There is also stat progression!\n\n2. Youll have to come up with an original character, no canon characters from any other universes allowed, please!\n\n3. The roleplay is really long term, however, note that your character can die. Don't go charging recklessly into battle unless you want the roleplay to be cut short. \n\n4. I've been working on characters and the universe for this roleplay for a while, though this is the first time I've actually tried executing it. With that being said, please be patient and bear with me!\n\n5. This roleplay is designed for both single and multiple characters. Want to venture in alone? Maybe control multiple characters? Maybe even bring a buddy or two? I'm down for it all!\n\nPS: If you PM me, put the planet that was overrun in the subject for a secret prize!",

            "selftext": "HELLO! After a short little hiatus, I'm in need of new partners! With season 4's date closing in on us I'm getting extremely pumped to RP in this universe! This MHA roleplay will take place a few years into the future, directly after they graduate. This particular RP will begin right before the Pro Hero License exams.\n\nI'm a massive My Hero Academia fan so I'll be playing a ton of characters! Here are my rules/notes for the RP:\n\n* If you plan on playing a canon character, I require you to be caught up to the manga! If you are playing an OC, this is unnecessary. IF you are playing an OC, they cannot be from U.A. High. I know that might be a bummer to some people but I find it easiest to have the OC interact with the characters from canon if they do not know each other personally, it helps make certain discrepancies with the characters a non-factor when they interact with each other.\n* I will be playing both OC's and canon characters.\n* Due to the nature of the RP, spoilers will be included from time to time!\n* I do NOT mind you playing a character (specifically an OC) with a strong quirk. But you have to be smart about it. Are they making bad use of their strong quirk? Are they MASTERS of their quirk? Give them some physical or mental drawbacks if so, like most characters have.\n\nOkay that's all I can think of for that part. Now to what I am looking for in a partner:\n\n* **18+ in age**! I cannot stress this enough! Dark themes can and will occur in this roleplay. Happens all the time in the anime/manga!\n* Please be a female. It says so in the title but some people don't see that. I have five male partners currently and need to balance the scales.\n* Literate. I just want to be able to understand what I'm reading.\n* Minimum one paragraph per response. The more the merrier! I would prefer it if our responses match in length, although sometimes I can get carried away and type a lot. That's when I wouldn't expect you to match.\n* 2-3 responses per day. Same thing goes here, even more and I'll be a happy roleplayer! I understand life gets in the way so if you can't meet the requirement sometimes, don't worry! I'll understand.\n* Lately I have been doing a lot of low effort RP's (which isn't necessarily a bad thing, some people enjoy short replies and such) so I'll be scouting out for higher tier roleplayers this time around. This doesn't mean you have to be the literary genius of the new millennia, but I am looking for passion and effort put into posts, even if they are on the shorter side of things. I want someone to suck me into the roleplay!\n* Again, can't stress how much I'm looking for a quality partner! I would prefer if your passion for MHA is strong, as I find the roleplays are much more enjoyable than if I'm writing with someone that only writes MHA roleplays just because they are bored. I get that it contradicts my title but I have met a few writers that have fallen in love with the series just because they gave the RP a shot.\n\nThat's just about everything! DM me your favorite character's name so I know you've read the heck darn thing and understand what I'm looking for. If you get that far, we'll iron out the rest of the details! Thanks for reading =)",

            "selftext": "First of all, a bit about me. I am an experienced, mature RPer who has a number of years of experience in different formats, including face-to-face, email, forums and the like. Primarily, I am interested in character interaction and development, especially through storytelling, conversation and relationship building. I like to see well developed, well thought out and believable characters. I prefer exotic or unusual settings, primarily science fiction, cyberpunk or post-apocalyptic. \u201cReal world/slice of life\u201d scenarios aren\u2019t that interesting to me; if it's something like a military or espionage setting, maybe, but not something 'mundane'. With that being said, I\u2019m open to ideas if they\u2019re original or creative or a little unusual.\n\nI generally like well-written, well thought out posts, and definitely prefer quality over quantity. I don\u2019t want to read a novel with each post, but I don\u2019t want to see one-line-wonders. Similarly, I am a stickler for grammar and spelling and punctuation, although I am prone to the odd bout of ferocious typos myself. However, as long as the intent is there, then I\u2019m happy.\n\nMy interests lie in mutual storytelling and creativity, rather than playing along to somebody else\u2019s story or the like. I control my character, I decide what\u2019s going on with them, I create their background and so on. I ask for my partners to respect that, as I will do the same for them. Likewise, I will never launch a major story element or a plot twist or the like without okaying it with a partner, as I would expect them to do the same for me. If I do something a partner doesn't want, then I'll gladly change it, but I ask that they will do the same for me.\n\nI\u2019m flexible as to settings and backgrounds. I am currently looking for **Sci-Fi**, **Cyberpunk** and **Post-Apocalyptic** RP in original settings. I am also interested in fandom RPs based on **Star Wars**, **Battletech/Mechwarrior, Shadowrun** and **Fallout**, but only using OCs. I am **only** looking for one-on-one RP, not groups or Player/GM experiences.\n\nIf you are interested, please contact me by **PM**. I will not reply to messages posted here or chat requests.",

Lit-Literate, preferably with 8-10 sentences, possibly more per response!\n\n\u2022Don\u2019t make me carry the story, input is greatly required! We make the story together!\n\n\u2022Romance, SoL, Drama, Horror, Supernatural are the genres I do! Mix and match as you please!\n\n\u2022I do tend to get a little NSFW with things, so if that\u2019s fine with you, it\u2019s fine with me!\n\n\u2022No godmodding- No overpowered OC\u2019s who can survive everything thrown at them. Uninteresting backstories usually come with them. Sorry!\n\n\u2022No military OC\u2019s. They all act the same to me, and it gets pretty old.\n\n\u2022No glorifying mental disorders- PTSD, depression, suicidal thoughts, everything like that. It sucks.\n\n\nAnd that\u2019s all I really have to say on that matter!\n\nAnyway, I hope to see you in my DM\u2019s! Thanks!\n-Grim",

Tall, handsome, cold-hearted and feared by many. Of course, he wasn't always this way (*queue dramatic life-changing backstory.)*  At the center of the city, an underground (possibly burlesque) club serves as the hub for criminal activity. They are notorious for illegal exchanges of drugs, human trafficking and even weapons smuggling.  Character A is a regular and that's where he makes the encounter of one of the dancers, **Character B(female)**. She reminds him of simpler times and of his first tragic love.  He falls for her against his nature and drags her into a world of filth where his jealousy and possessiveness gets the best of him. His love his bruises on her skin and lipstick smudges on his neck. They are toxic for each other but pulled together like magnets.   \n\n\n* **DETAILS:**  \nMy name is Elle.  \nI am 26 years old and seeking a partner 20+  \nI would love a literate writer who can keep up with my replies  \nRoleplaying to me is like writing a novel with two people. I would love someone who is as enthusiastic as I am about the plotline and willing to bring ideas and plot twists to keep the story going.  \nI am all about faceclaims (no anime or cartoons), gifs and Pinterest boards!   \n\n* **PLATFORMS:**  \nTumblr  \nDiscord  \nFacebook  \nEmail  \n(Open to more ideas)",

I'd love to plot about it!**\n\n**I'd love for this plot to be an action/adventure/slow burn romance!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**If you have any other interesting idea, please feel free to shoot me over it and maybe we can plot together?**\n\nCharacter Sheet: https://i.imgur.com/65JvoKz.jpg\n\nMake sure to read the entire post, lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# About me\n\n* I am a 22 male (**I don't RP with people below the age of 18 due to the mature themes**).\n* I am in the EST timezone.\n* **I prefer a partner who can reply multiple times a day** or at least chat to let me know you're still interested and usually if there is a long space without a post, I lose interest. I totally get life gets in the way sometimes as well!\n* I prefer for my partner to be literate and contributing to the story as well (Plotting, having their character be a character of action, etc).\n* I am a Police Officer, so sometimes my time gets very limited (not that other jobs don't) since I work about from 5 to 6 to 7 days a week, not including doubles I sometimes pull.\n* I prefer romance to be a part of the story, but if you don't want it to be, that's totally fine, just let me know beforehand.\n* I like to talk in OOC and plot a lot, so please let me know if you don't want to.\n* I like a lot of drama in my RPs since I feel it keeps the story interesting.\n* I would prefer to RP on discord, but if you have an option you would like to try, I am totally fine with that.\n* I'm pretty easy going, so if you have more to add to the plot or the basic narrative I typed above, please don't hesitate to let me know.\n* I try to keep my posts around 1 - 3 paragraphs, but I can definitely post more if it warrants it.\n* If you've read the entire post, please shoot me a PM with your favorite color otherwise I won't respond.\n* I like to post music with my posts sometimes if I feel there is a need for a dramatic feel in a post. If you don't like that, please let me know beforehand.\n* If this at all interests you, please feel free to shoot me a PM and I will shoot my discord over to you!",

Aeganys, as well as two other siblings were all that was left, they truly were the last Dragons. They kept Kings Landing as well their ancestral home of Westeros, Dragonstone, using Dragonstone as their seat of power. Their King sat at Dragonstone and Prince Aeganys sat at Kings Landing.\n\nThe rest of the Kingdoms were in turmoil, who would choose to claim important areas such as the Reach or Stormlands as their own?

I don't avoid swearing or adult subject matter if/when it shows up in a story so I'd to write with someone closer to my age. So please be 20+, no exceptions. I'm looking to improve my writing and roleplay skills so I'd like have a partner that's experienced in both. I usually write anywhere between a couple paragraphs to several depending on dialogue and the scene.\n\nI only have a few ideas at the moment. Almost all of them are dramatic and moody. At least that's how I imagine them playing out lol.\n\n* **Detective / Crime story**: A couple different pairings for this one. 1) Our characters are newly paired partners tasked with solving a murder. Little do they know that details of the case run deeper than they seem. 2) Similar to the first pairing, our characters are solving a murder or perhaps a missing person(s) case, but one of our characters is a career criminal that has an interest in the case.\n* **Paranormal / SCP story:** General idea I had was a pair of investigators that specialize in investigating paranormal happenings or occurrences. Starts off as more of a hobby/activity but it gets serious when they actually come across paranormal artifacts/ events. Alternatively, they're part of an organization that handles such things.\n* **The Boys**: Not entirely sure what I want to do in terms of a story, but it's a setting I'd love to try! It'd take place in the Amazon series universe of course.\n* **Generic Horror story:** I'm not too good with titles lol, but with Halloween ahead, I've been going through a lot of horror stories/movies lately and I've caught the fever for it. I'm open to different ideas, but I've been leaning towards a Silent Hill-ish/ mysterious haunted town vibe these days.\n\nNot much else to really cover or consider, but hope that interests someone!",

However, the once glorious kingdom fell to ruin and the cause of which was veiled in mystery. Now, the story of the kingdom was a legend, a myth of a place full of treasure and relics that lured thousands of adventurers to they\u2019re deaths because of the harsh environment, immense monsters and the simple fact that the kingdoms whereabouts are known to only a few that have records of the lost home.\n\nThe land where the kingdom once stood now has several kingdoms and villages scattered around that all live comfortably with each other after several years of war and death. However, none of the kingdoms despite large populations went near the dark forest that split the land in two. The forest was said to be home to creatures the likes of which would turn regular vicious thirsty beasts into snacks. \n\nAlexander was an adventurer that went from kingdom to kingdom, exploring what he could and taking jobs whilst he stayed in a town in order to keep his money up if he ever needed it. It was during his travels he heard tell of the ancient kingdom, the legend of it and the mystery around it, it intrigued him like nothing before and so he set out in search of it, along with the goal of finding out why it fell to ruin.",

            "selftext": "So I had this idea of creating a group rp with a setting like BNHa if you have watched/read it. If not, it's a school to train people with power to be hero's. Except this idea of mine includes more detail. This includes different students, teachers, staff, and principle, all being played by real people. I came up with this idea to create a whole world run by the players. This idea may give a slow start, but more people working and helping my idea come true will be very appreciated. If you're interested in creating a world for people to make their own stories, then please message me because I think I'll start on making the group itself. This idea will be acted out on Discord because of the sheer options available. If you're interested, I hope to hear from you.",

While the game already possesses a semblance of a story with a set canon, the intention of Divine War is to provide more of a narrative to the world, such as minor battles for territory between two pantheons, alliances, rivalries between individual gods and goddesses, all while culminating in climactic, catastrophic events such as the battle of Ragnar\u00f6k.\n\n Valhalla or Olympus, there shall be battles between the deities of man across the globe in their struggle against each other.\n\n Poster only requests that applicants be at least the age of 16, as the narrative could touch on some heavy themes or imply things that are hard to stomach. Furthermore, once joining, members are advised to audition for which god or goddess they'd like to roleplay as. It must maintain the spirit of the character to be considered.\n\n (Post concluded; Leave comment for creator to consult with at 1:00 P.M. EST)",

To start this off, let me tell you a bit about myself ^-^\n\nI am from Europe (CET) and English isn\u2019t my first language, but I like to think I\u2019m fairly decent at it. Rp is one of my favorite things to do, and it has been (and still is!) a great way for me to improve my writing skills.\n\nI\u2019d prefer a literate partner (at least a few lines, decent grammar, spelling and punctuation please - I know, sounds funny coming from a non native English speaker, but please respect that), and someone who can typically respond a few times per day. \n\nMy absolutely favorite genre is fantasy! High fantasy, preferably medieval, and if you\u2019re interested in that as well, I\u2019d already love to speak to ya!\n\nAlrighty, just a bit more info, bear with me! \nI have a few ideas, but I\u2019d love to hear yours, too.\n\nI can play characters of both genders, but gravitate towards playing males, mostly. It really depends on the story, tho! \nI\u2018m open to romance (mxm and mxf are both equally welcome), but it is not required.\n\nI mainly use discord to rp, but am willing to look into alternatives if we click well!\n\nIf you\u2019re interested, please pm me, or leave a comment! :)",

            "selftext": "Hello all! I've decided to go on a hunt for some roleplay partners. First, a bit about myself. \n\nI am a 20 year old girl who loves to create characters of all kinds and act out roleplays that are funny, romantic, and worth the time invested. While I do have my moments of business or tiredness, I am pretty free most the time. I roleplay in 3rd Person and my personal favorite genres are slice of life and/or modern fantasy mixed with romance. I'm not too picky on length but my comfort zone is 2-15+ lines depending on my level of creativity and how much the other person puts out. I do prefer LGBT roleplays although I can do straight roleplays. I prefer our characters to be able to change out on the who wears the pants role or for me to be the lesser pants wearer. Most of my characters are less masculine  or ambiguous. EST Time Zone.\nNow onto preferences for my partner. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMUSTS: \n\nMust be willing and able to have or create a decently fleshed out character. I have a character template that I use for my ocs if you need one. Character tropes are fine, although I take some issue with some but as long as they go beyond that trope and are their own person beyond 1 or 2 character traits, they're fine!\n\nMust have decent grammar and spelling. Now I know nobody's grammar or spelling is perfect, but I need to be able to understand what you're typing. \n\nMust reply at least every other day. I understand being busy and having times where you can't reply for a few days but id like to be notified if and when those things happen. I usually wait 4-7 days for someone to reply and will send the occasional 'hi' or 'hey' as a reminder. (Note: I also encourage you to be annoying to get me to reply. Sometimes I get distracted to the point of forgetting to reply or Discord won't send my reply or won't notify me when you reply. Send me reminders. If I ghost you it's never on purpose.) \n\nMUST NOT GHOST. I get being busy or even not wanting to roleplay with me. LET ME KNOW. So many people tend to ghost  when They get busy or dont want to tell me that they're not feeling me or the roleplay. Tell me. That way I know and can have a little closure. \n\nHave Discord.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEXTRA POINTS IF (you do not have to share these but it helps if you do)\n\nYou roleplay LGBT\n\nYou like multiple RPs, multiple characters to be going on at once (I LOVE polyamory)\n\nYou like talking and developing the RP as its happening\n\nYou are okay with rping as/with ocs who are mentally ill or physically disabled in some way. \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSend me a message telling me about you, what you like/don't like in a roleplay, and if you hit any of the extra points!

I mostly write in fandoms but I am into some more original ideas as well, but all of the things I like to write have one thing in common: Smut. I love to write smut and I hope you do too because if not this probably will not work out.\n\nI have a lot of fandoms that I enjoy as I said above, these include but are not limited to: (Bold is cravings)  \nDisney  \n**Game of Thrones**  \nMarvel  \nDC Comics  \n**Legend of Zelda (any of them)**  \nThe Witcher  \nBioshock  \nDestiny  \n**Star Wars**  \nStranger Things  \nOverwatch  \nAnd many many others, just ask, I probably have enough knowledge about it to get something started.\n\nI am over 20, and I would rather my partners be also, no one under 18, and I prefer to write with people 20 and over as I am also older.\n\nI expect responses that are between two or three paragraphs and up. Shorter responses are okay, but when I get into a story, I tend to write more and more and more as I get more into it, so please don\u2019t add if you cannot write more than a paragraph or two.\n\nI write MxF ONLY, and I will only play Male characters and only against Female characters. I like for my roleplays to be very long term, so I like to have a great deal of planning when it comes to anything I write, so please don\u2019t be afraid to plot or chat out of character.\n\nI don\u2019t write through email, or google docs, I will only write on discord. Please do not contact me asking to write on a different medium, it will be ignored.\n\nThat\u2019s about it! If you\u2019re over 20 and really enjoy writing smut, send me message on here and we can exchange discords.\n\n||||\n|:-|:-|:-|\n||||",

Second, I'm an 18-year-old girl (please don't be a creep) who is from England which means I am on the GMT timezone. Since most of you are on EST that will be EST+5 but my sleeping schedule is horrendous so I'll more than likely be available during any time you may wish to rp. I only write in third person and said person is usually an oc as writing fandom characters can get rather stale for me.   \n\n\nSo next, what do I want to write. I am capable of writing most genres although high sci-fi (anything beyond the 100) is a little too jarring for me; my personal favourite would be anything to do with fantasy. I also would consider specific fandom rps such as ATLA and such but that is on a case to case basis and would have to be addressed directly. Now I don't have much left to say, please don't ghost and please don't be a creep? Hope to see the messages rolling in soon. Peace!",

            "selftext": "A New Dawn is a discord [A New Dawn](https://discord.gg/JfY27Wt)server centered around the warrior cats series. The server is mainly dedicated to literate-advanced roleplay, although not entirely founded upon it. A New Dawn is also a sanctuary for fans to meet new online friends, to share art and creative writing, and much more. The server is intended to be a place for fans of all ages, regardless of personal differences.\n\nThis is a brand new server, but is promised to grow as new members join. Currently, there is one clan, but with time more will be added as the server grows. High ranks are open but must be auditioned for.\n\n**__History of the Clan__**\n\nMany moons ago a group of cats made the decision to break away from their domestic roots, so that they may live free in the wild. As time passed the cats began to thrive as they learned how to live off the bountiful land. Soon they developed their own system of hierarchy, clan customs and religion. A she cat named Brightstar was elected leader by the will of their fallen ancestors, which they formally know as StarClan. It was Brightstar that decreed the warrior code and gave the clan its formal name; OakClan.\n\n**__Present Day__** \n\nAlthough many cats agreed with Brightstar being elected leader and the warrior code, a few were not pleased with the decisions that were finalized. Even though these few do not directly oppose Brightstar or the warrior code, they are in the works of deception. The future is not set in stone, will the clan find harmony together or be torn apart from within?",

We\u2019re very particular in wanting someone that is both a treat to write with and a pleasure to talk to OOC. We currently sit at a very comfortable roster, but we\u2019d love to shake things up a little with a few, new, must-have individuals.*\n\n*Our reasoning for being quite exclusively small is that we don\u2019t want anyone feeling lost in a crowd of names. We really do want to get to know everyone individually and create immersive content that can wholeheartedly be enjoyed. We feel it\u2019s just not possible to connect with anyone properly if there\u2019s 50 odd people in a server.*\n\n*Size truly doesn\u2019t matter (where it counts). We\u2019ve always been a quaint little group- and in the nearly two years of being operational, there has never been a shortage of stories and writing opportunities. In fact, since the first of January, 2019, there has been an active session going on every single day. So, if you\u2019re looking to get your writing itch scratched, rest assured it will if you end up taking a fancy to us!***.**\n\n**\u30fb\u309c\u272d\u30fb.\u30fb\u272b\u30fb\u309c\u30fb\u3002.** **.\u30fb\u3002.\u30fb\u309c\u272d\u30fb.\u30fb\u272b\u30fb\u309c\u30fb\u3002.** **Synopsis** **.\u30fb\u3002.\u30fb\u309c\u272d\u30fb.\u30fb\u272b\u30fb\u309c\u30fb\u3002.**  **.\u30fb\u3002.\u30fb\u309c\u272d\u30fb.\u30fb\u272b\u30fb\u309c**\n\n*Wyrdafel is a town located in Yorkshire, England. It is a hotspot for supernatural beings due to its rich history with magic spanning long before the Dark Ages. It is the place to be for wizards, werewolves, and other weirdos to find their sense of purpose and community. There\u2019s just one catch\u2026 normal humans (aptly named \u2018Normies\u2019) cannot find out they exist.*\n\n*Supernaturals must remain a secret from the \u2018Normies\u2019 or else chaos could break loose. As if matters weren\u2019t tense enough, the Supernatural Supreme Court (SSC) keeps an uncomfortably close eye on the mythical populace to make sure they stay in line\u2026 but they are known to take things a little bit too far. From accepting bribes to being outwardly cruel toward the people they are supposed to protect, it's hard to trust in the governing force.*\n\n\\*You will play as either a Normie or a Supernatural when you enter our modern-fantasy world (you are allowed multiple characters). Will you make a big impact in changing everything as we know it? Or are you more partial to slacking off by the pool and sliding under the radar? In this malleable world you become precisely what you are most interested in writing about.

Not enough frogs though and very few people pay the memetax. Certainly room for improvement. On a serious note however, with the risk of sounding utterly biased, the group is great.

I am a female in my 20's who would like nothing more than to play my lovely Kindred OC [Mariana Cormaic](https://imgur.com/5Jvqz66) in some slice of life (and possibly romantic) role play's set in a city in The World of Darkness during the early 2000's. Mariana is a 10th generation Brujah (Or Malkavian) born in 1927 and embraced in 1950 who I'm looking to partner with either male or female mortals or preferably thin-blooded (or simply higher generation, lowest gen I'll play with is 10th). I'm generally quite open minded in terms of plot and ideas, but I'm looking for a role play with a heavy focus on telling and enthralling story good story and forging an interesting dynamic between two characters. I don't really have a preference for post length, I believe that you should write as much as needed and not waffle on to fill and arbitrary post length. I prefer to play on Discord, so if this ad has caught your eye leave a comment and I'll message you with my details :)",

I'm looking for anyone, male or female, age 18+ to Roleplay with somebody on kik or discord. I'm really easy to get along with, and most of the time I use created characters for just about any scenario, but there are some instances I use Canon Characters. I'm up for all sorts of settings, scenarios, timeframes, etc. It could be modern day, fantasy, semi-fantasy, medieval, futuristic, magical, post-apocalyptic, you name it, I can try to make it work. That being said, I'm a huge fan of action packed RP's as well. I know my way around firearms as well so if you have knowledge of firearms too, I think we'll make a great team.\n\nWhy 18+ you ask? Well there are lots of times where it can get a little steamy, and I'm not trying to get jammed up. Please respect that. All of the 18+ aspects of the RP can be discussed when you message me.\n\nWhen it comes to fandoms/universes that I wouldn't mind RPing (both original and canon characters) in: Metal Gear is at the top of my list. I'm also a big fan of Resident Evil (or anything zombie related), Uncharted, and quite a few others. Just ask!\n\nI can get rather detailed in my posts. I'm not a huge fan of things like \"\\*aims and shoots zombie in head\\*\" or \"\\*reloads\\*\". We're essentially writing a story together, it should sound like one. I can write in both first and third person, past or present tense. Whatever works best for you will work for me.\n\nIf you made it this far, hopefully you're interested! Shoot me a DM and we can work out the details.\n\nI work for a living and I do have an outside life, so please don't get hot and bothered if it takes me a while to respond sometimes.\n\nLook forward to hearing from you all!",

            "selftext": "r/StarTrekPowers takes place after several devastating wars tore apart the Star Trek universe: the federation shatters in a civil war following controversy and disagreement, while the Klingons and Romulans wage war on one another over the rights of conquest and splinters of the former federation. After much fighting to no avail, the two powers succumb to internal instability and soon find many factions vying for power. On the other side of the former Federation, the Cardassian Union endures equal hardship as shortages and unrest build to intolerable levels ultimately causing similar struggles as seen across the Alpha and Beta quadrants.\n\nHowever, now with most of the greater wars at an end, Klingon, Romulan, and Cardassian factions still fight for power in their former empires. Klingon warlords raid one another tirelessly, Romulans fight for what technology and power they can, and the Cardassians fight to restore their former unity. Though things aren\u2019t as bad in the old Federation, the successor Federation States are constantly at each other's throats for resources, space, and votes in the sudden power vacuum.\n\nJoin us, and shape the future of the Star Trek galaxy, what will you choose diplomacy or the phaser. The fate of the quadrants, and perhaps one day the galaxy, lies in your hands.\n\nWill you go boldly, where no one has gone before? \n\nhttps://discord.gg/avyBu4z",

I will list the following fandoms there will be a star beside the one I am more eager to write about.\n\n\nSupernatural.*\nBBC Sherlock.*\nOnce Upon a Time.\nMarvel.*\nDoctor Who.\nHarry Potter.\n\n\nI am seeking for somebody to play either an OC or a canon character. For Sherlock and Supernatural I do ask canon characters. In example: Sam or Dean even both if you can handle playing multiple characters. Sherlock, John, Mycroft, or if you can Sherlock and John I have all of the crime scenes and opening scenes thought out. Or I can play John and you can be Sherlock or if you want an interesting love triangle the Holmes boys can fight it out among each other over the intelligent woman which suddenly throws everything upside down. For Marvel I do have preference over the hero's; Doctor Strange, Captain America, Loki..once more I am open hearing about OC but I have the craving to write with canon characters. You can add your own twist to the canon character but their personality must remain the same. It is alright to do something out of their regular mindset but dont change it completely.\n\nI am very happy to do romance or NSFW themes I only ask for story progression. I feel comfortable being my OCs but I will play canon characters or side characters to make the story move and thrilling. I only ask to treat my time like it is important. I will respect your time and work out schedules so we can enjoy writing together. Please message me for more information.",

I would also like to thank you personally for clicking on my post, and taking the time to read through it. \n\nTo get into the juicier portions of everything, I\u2019ll first tell you who I am. My name is Joshua, I recently turned 20 years old, and I have been writing for around 7 or so years. I\u2019ve been around the block some could say, but there are other people on here that blow me out of the water. Nevertheless, I am capable of writing multiple paragraphs (oftentimes exceeding the 2,000 character limit on discord), writing grammatically correct and scholarly sentences, and providing true character development. \n\nAs far as roleplay goes, I want someone who is committed to creating a story with me. I have been thinking about really getting into writing short horror, and I\u2019m using this as a conduit to flex my creative muscles in the field. I haven\u2019t really had much opportunity to write about unseen grotesque horrors beyond the capabilities of human minds. I also really want someone who is interested in character development. If nothing else, I really want to impact on character development as in these types of roleplays it\u2019s very prevalent. After all, how would you feel after seeing Cthulhu\u2019s shimmering figure behind a cloud fog after he\u2019s been risen from the tombs beneath the deep waves. If it were me, I\u2019d probably lose a few screws. \n\nThat aside, please be 18+ when contacting me as I do enjoy including NSFW features. I have a few ideas in my head that we can talk about, and I\u2019d love to hear all of yours as well! If you\u2019ve read this far, please put your favorite color in your title. Lastly, you don\u2019t need to know a lot about Lovecraftian Mythos, but it helps obviously. If you\u2019re just a wandering writer looking for something new, I\u2019m happy to oblige and indulge you in this nerdy world. Thank you for reading, I really appreciate it and I can\u2019t wait to get writing!",

If that's you, come on down!)  \nIn a land far, far away, lies the Kingdom of Fiore, a small peaceful nation of 17 million, and a place filled with magic! Found in every home, bought and sold in every marketplace, for most, magic is merely a tool, a mundane part of everyday life. For some, however, magic is an art, and they have devoted their lives to its practice. These are the mages. Banded together into magical guilds they apply their skills in search of fame and fortune. Many such guilds dot the landscape of Fiore. Young Hopeful wizards line up across the country to join these guilds... And for the citizens, this is a happy sight... but there are dark forces at play... a long forgotten kingdom come to rise again. Will the wizards of Fiore be able to find these ancient people? And what choice will they make to their fate?  \n\n\nIt has been revealed to the world that the very Golems who spent their immortal lives serving the powerful dragons were trapped underground by the very humans they tried to help... now they seek revenge on the world... and the Dark Guilds remaining in Fiore are more than happy to help them get that revenge... through whatever means necessary.  \n\\------------------------------------------------------------------  \nBut what can we offer to you?

In the end, the 15 gods defeated the dark forces, sealing them away for two thousand years. Being weakened themselves, the fifteen gods disappeared and were quickly forgotten about by the races they protected. Years upon years later, the continent was in turmoil due to racism, the desperation of supplies, and religious difference. Races turned on each other and declared small wars, some species being hunted to extinction. Humans were the worst of these offenders in the past, sometimes wiping out whole races only for coin. One day, your family found a destroyed caravan on the side of the road, the entire small army slaughtered except for a small boy. Taking him in as one of their own, they raised the child beside you and you both became best friends. After some time, you both grew to adulthood, always on the lookout for adventure. We had found a map from a street vendor depicting a dungeon with enough gold to make a king Jealous, so we decided to leave our small village and be what we have always wanted to be. Adventurers.   \n\n\nThanks for reading! I am looking for a partner who can hit around 2 paragraphs and play multiple characters as we introduce them into the story.

            "selftext": "Hello! I go by Jay, and I\u2019m a longtime RPer that\u2019s looking for another like-minded creative individual. Over the years I\u2019ve had the pleasure of writing with a plethora of people, in just about every genre imaginable. I\u2019ve cultivated friendships with these individuals outside of writing that\u2019s led to some of the best RP\u2019s that have spanned years. So, when I look for a partner, I\u2019m looking for someone who wants something long-term, enjoys world building, character development, and story development through the RP itself. Hopefully you share those same values.\n\nI\u2019m primarily a novella style poster (Three paragraphs or more), but I also take into account what\u2019s going on in the story, as well as my partner\u2019s style. Quantity is certainly not everything. I do my best to make sure spelling, punctuation, and grammar are absolutely basic (What good is RP if you can\u2019t understand what I\u2019m typing?), so you should as well. I admit though, I have a love/hate relationship with commas. Also, I love email. I usually transpose the RP while it\u2019s happening to Google Docs, where writing can also happen. I\u2019m open to Discord, but it\u2019s not really work friendly for me. We can talk about this.\n\nAs the title suggests, I\u2019m looking for RP set in the world of Trinity, Fallout, Modern Fantasy or WoD. We would have original characters and use base information that\u2019s readily available. From there we can begin plotting. World building, characters, character histories, background, and storytelling. The works. I want to share the story, not run it. You shouldn\u2019t want to do so either. The flow should be automatic and the equilibrium between push/pull of events by writers should be balanced. I\u2019m an adult (Please be 21+), so please expect mature themes. \n\nAeon Trinity - Cyberpunk to the fullest. Science Fiction with a taste of realism. I have a site made with information to get new writers started.\n\nFallout - It\u2019s Fallout, not much more needs to be said.\n\nWoD - Vampires, wolves, demons, witches, etc. Modern Supernatural Horror. It never gets old.\n\nModern Fantasy - A genre I haven't explored yet, but I'm willing to give it a go. Think of melding LoTR into modern times. Something like Bright. I have an idea in mind, but will be open to all suggestions.\n\nStar Wars - It\u2019s Star Wars, not much more needs to be said.\n\nHey, if you made it this far, thanks for reading. Shoot me a line if interested! Still looking!",

We should develop these more as we talk.\n\n1.) Royalty &amp; Bodyguard\n\nThere has been a betrayal, a kingdom has fallen and the royal family has been almost entirely slaughtered. By mere luck, only a piece of the royal family escaped, and with them, their bodyguard.\n\n2.) Red Riding Hood (esque)\n\nThere is a destination that must be reached, yet it lies through these perilous woods. It is said that a haunted person dwells eternally, some call it a ghost, others say it is a demon, but what is certain is that from the many people who have come here before, most have disappeared.\n\n3.) Forbidden Magics\n\nA mage is sentenced to death for their practice of black magic, yet they never make it to the gallows. By orders of a noble, maybe even royalty, this mage has been bought out of their death sentence. They are sent to an estate where they are tasked with teaching a spoiled, power-hungry noble the secrets of black magic.\n\nPM me if you're down, and if you have a favorite idea be sure to tell me in your introduction.",

My character is pretty much developed and so is the instance in which both characters meet but this can always be discussed and changed.\n\nPlease note that I am 24 years of age so I do ask that you be at least 18 years or older. Romance is something that is expected to develop between these character so I wish to write with someone who is similar minded. \n\nThe world is akin to the one seen in MHA (My Hero Academia) where people can be born with Quirks/Superpowers and is pretty common. This story will mainly be focused in Japan between two prominent yakuza families.\n\nA deal has to be struck between two families that are big in the underground communities.There is a family whom's boss hasn't been seen for years but only heard about in rumors. While the family is very active, he never does any business deals face to face. Speaking with the boss is even seldom inside the family, only high ranking commanders ever being able to see a glimpse of him during ceremonials and testimonials.\n\nHowever, it turns out that the boss is a young woman who doesn't seem to have much experience in running a large syndicate. Your character finds this out when they finally are able to push the family into a corner, attempting to make a business deal happen with them under the circumstance that they respect code and follow through with a deal made through the heads of the family face to face.\n\n\"Unless we deal with the boss upfront, we wont allow for your ships to pass through our turf.\"\n\nOf course the reason my character is just the acting head temporarily-- but nobody, outside of a trusted, few knows that.\n\n\nI have more information about my character (who is a female) available if you're interested and a intro post is already written as well. Feel free to message me if you're interested or post on this thread.",

            "selftext": "As stated in the title, I've been wanting to do a Sword Art Online Roleplay recently as I have been getting back into the series after falling out of it a few years ago. As for when it would be taking place, I would rather it be during the SAO incident as that is where I have the most knowledge in and what the OC's I have made are set in . I have both male and female OC's so I don't really care on who I play as. I also don't mind if there is romance in it, if it is MXF or FXF. \n\nTo note also, I don't mind if we start it right at the beginning of the incident or a year or few months into it. Having it be set at different times could certainly be interesting. \n\nNow as for how I write and just how I am, I typically do better writing at least a paragraph or two but I can do more if you are up to it. I also find it more fun to play more than one character but that is just me so I don't mind if you just want to stick to one.\n\nNow I do have a life so there will be at times where I will be busy I do tend to keep updates on my situation so that you may know how it is and when I may be free or busy. Last thing though, please at least be 18 or older since I don't exactly like the thought of roleplaying with a minor and am more comfortable with people around my age with that being 20.\n\nFor location and timezone stuff, United States and my timezone is EST.\n\nIf you're interested or have any questions, just message me and I will send you my discord stuff.",
