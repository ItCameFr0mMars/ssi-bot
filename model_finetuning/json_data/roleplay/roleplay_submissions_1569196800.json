I thought by creating and designing cute OCs but barely enough to design what they\u2019d be like, personality wise. \nThat\u2019s why Roleplaying comes into play. I want to share my characters with others. To help me be creative and breathe life into my characters. \n\nIt sounds silly I know, but I thought it would be a good idea to put an ad here. To find someone with a like mind, and creativity to get together. \n\nI\u2019m alright with NSFW themes, just not the too weird things of that side. Call me old fashion. \nAs for themes in general. I like supernatural themes, Slice of life, high fantasy( like DND), or horror.\nPairing wise: I can do M/F, F/F, and M/M. I have so many characters to fit any fancy you may like. \nI can not RP as canon characters, I don\u2019t watch a lot of anime/Tv shows and just makes me uncomfortable. \n\nAs to what I expect from my partners... well I'm not asking for much just to follow the basic rules of etiquette:\n\nWhen I ask you what type of RP me you would like to do. Dont just go:\n 'idk.' \nWell then why did you seek me out in the first place?? At least have a basic idea of what youd want and we can bounce ideas back and forth. \n\nI'm immediately going to be turned off if you want nothing but Smut. My characters are like my own kids and they're not for you to satisfy an 'itch'. At least let there be some kind of plot and development between our characters. \n\nTell me what you're comfortable doing. That way I have a better understanding what kind of character I'll be playing as.\n\nOh and one last thing... I dont do furries. Nothing against them but not my thing. I have half/human ocs /cat and bunny girls, etc/ \n\nSorry for the rules. I've been doing this song and dance for so long, and I've seen so many people disregard my comfort and lost interest. So if you've read the rules and  you\u2019re interested just PM and I\u2019ll  send over the contacts of which you can contact me over Discord or Email.",

            "selftext": "Hey there! This is my first rp ad in Reddit but I have been into this hobby for over a decade, starting from this small forum meant for teenaged girls that shall not be named. The community in that said forum (that I left years ago) grew big and most of my partners that stuck for years were from there. Sadly, one by one those stories have died out and now in my later twenties I feel a bit too old to go back so I need to look for new partners someplace else, so why not try Reddit?\n\nSo, I am heihoi, a woman on my later twenties and I have been roleplaying ever since I was like fifteen years old. I am literate and I put a great amount of work and detail into developing the characters, plot and the world they all live in so I really need a partner who is into world-building too. I also enjoy writing multiple characters of different age, sex and sexuality so if you only want to write one-on-one romance I might not be the right partner for you. Roleplaying in my opinion is about giving and taking so in order for both of us to enjoy what we\u2019re doing I hope to find someone who is also able to and willing to write both men and women in gay or straight relationships. I do not require you to write out explicit scenes, that can be discussed in private but I don\u2019t like it when I am stuck in one role and the partner is in the other. I do put the plot above the smutty stuff, so keep that in mind.\n\nStill reading? Great, maybe this could work out! I like darker themes in my rps and I have almost no limits as long as the angst and attention is shared evenly between my characters and yours. I don\u2019t want to always write the knight in the shining armor but I don\u2019t expect that from you either. I enjoy personalities that clash, difficult and dramatic relationships (be it romantic or not) and I am not afraid to make my characters to act like total twats at times. But even though I love the drama, there\u2019s a limit, and it has to fit the plot.\n\nI don't really have any ideas in mind so feel free to shoot me with yours. Or I do have some, but they're kinda vague so let's discuss them more in private. I will say that I like horror, realistic fantasy and slice of life (with a good plot) and that my stories tend to get a bit dark. \n\n\nLast but not least! Since I\u2019m an old fart, I don\u2019t write with anyone under the age of 21. The older you are the better. I also feel a bit uncomfortable writing with men because I\u2019ve had some creepy encounters already in this short amount of time I\u2019ve been getting back into rping. I'm sorry, I don't want to be mean. Anyway, if this sounded good pm and let's talk business!\n\nOh, and please don't ghost. I won't bite if you tell me you are not interested anymore, that happens. It's life. Just don't leave me wondering.",

I\u2019m looking for a 1x1 rp, which may include romance, but I don\u2019t want it to be forced. \n\nThe general plot is that there are monsters (duh) and about 100-150 children were born with magical powers. Not all of them are the same ago tho. The oldest one created an academy where these magical children could learn how to use their powers. When they arrive at the school, they usually already have a basic understanding of their powers, so they are first lead to a room in which there are a lot of weapons/artifacts that enhance your magic (usually made from monster bones). A weapon/artifact will then choose you, not the other way around, and that will be the item you will use for combat or whatever.\n\nI have a basic idea for my character.\n\nadult themes may be included, but I don\u2019t want them to be forced. This also depends on our characters age etc.\n\nI prefer to rp on discord, but anything is fine\n\nDM me or comment if you are interested!",

I prefer writing in third person, and have a long post length (excluding dialogue heavy scenes.) I would like a more literate partner to match my style. That being said I don\u2019t expect you to be a constant literary genius. Let\u2019s just have fun! You don't have to reply frequently, I understand everyone has responsibilities but please don't go MIA for a week without letting me know (I\u2019ll do the same for you). \n\nAlrighty my list of requirements are over, I hope that wasn't too much! Let's move on to prompts and fandoms. These all include romance because guess what? That\u2019s my favorite genre. So it would be fantastic if you were 18+ just in case we stumble into some messy territory. I also just prefer darker themes. Feel free to send my your prompts as well. \n\n- Accidentally summoning a demon? (Somehow the oc summons a demon, maybe it\u2019s a Halloween prank or they were scrolling through stuff online, who knows? All they know is that there\u2019s a demon in thier house.... and they\u2019re having a conversation with it...?   \n\nNSFW- My OC could possibly summon an incubus. \n\nThis would be an OCxDemon Rp. I wouldn\u2019t mind playing either one. Unless we went the incubus route then I\u2019d want to play an OC\n~~\n\n- Soulmates.\n0.010%. 1 in 10,000. Yet somehow you were the oh so *lucky* one to find your soulmate. People don\u2019t look for their destined mate anymore, the odds of ever finding them are just to slim, so they just settle for someone they like. Just like you had planned too. All until that day, when you brushed hand with him on the subway. The mark immediately formed, you could hear people gasping and some even congratulated you. This was a rare occurrence. But wasn\u2019t it supposed to be a happy one? You were furious. You had no choice now, you were forever tied to this person. \n\n(If soulmates touch, they will both be marked with a bruise on their bodies wherever they first touched each other physically. \nSome humans never find their soulmates. But if you do, you begin to depend on touching each other for energy to survive.\nIf you can't stay together to give each other energy... you die)\n\nBased on a book I read on Wattpad!\n\n~~\n\n- Character 1 is a healer, they enjoy helping people but for a small price. Nothing too big, nothing to small. They just ask for them to swear that they'll will do a favour for character 1 in the future. Character 1 never asks for to much. They might ask that you give an hour of your time to do something good, help someone or something.\n\n- Character 2 is injured really bad, almost at the point of death because /insert reason here/. They know that they're about to die, its inevitable. Character 2 doesn't want to die but it looks as though they have no say in the matter. But what happens when character 1 comes across character 2 in the snowy banks of the forest, near the bridge and almost frozen river. Well character 1 obviously does what is ever in their power to help character 2 but before character 1 helps character 2 they lean down and whisper a little question in character 2 ear. \"will you do me a favour if I save you?\n\nMaybe you\u2019re character finally found the person he wanted to pass down his knowledge of healing powers too? Or something, whatever you decided are characters will end up having to spend time together. \n\n~~\n\n\nThe characters listed are ones I\u2019d like you\u2019d play. I\u2019ll be playing an OC. \n\nFandoms-\n- My Hero Academia (Deku, kacchan, todoroki, aziawa, shigaraki)\n- Kuroko No Basket (Any member of generation of miracles, Taiga, Teppei, Hyuga, \n- Attack on Titan (Levi, Eren) \n- Fruit Baskets (Kyo, Yuki)\n\nIf you made it this far thank you! If you're interest in roleplay with me drop a message. I prefer you have a small promt so I can see your style. In can be something you've wrote before I or completely new. It doesn't have to be long a paragraph will do:)",

However, the longer and closer Character A is to Character B, Character A might just end up dead. That? Oh, that's going to be literally. To an extent ..\n\nI want the story to be about the two. It doesn't have to be romance. It could be about moral growth, self-discipline/discovery, maturity, the list goes on. You know? These can be slice of life, low/high fantasy, I don't care.

Send me a message with your Discord username if you're interested.  I'm not really interested in fandoms/EUs, I'd rather build the world as we go.  I roleplay in third person.  I'm pretty flexible on how you want to roleplay regarding word count, I don't have a minimum, and am more of a \"whatever the story currently calls for\" type of person.  However, if all you're giving me is one word responses, it's probably not going to work out very well.  If you cant only respond once a week, I'm not going to be interested in that either.\n\nI enjoy worldbuilding in the moment, basically create the basis for your character and then we'll run with it and build what we need when we need it.  Grammar is important to me, so please have a decent grasp on the English language.  I require that you're at least 21+ in age, and NSFW is encouraged, but not the entire roleplay.  As I said in my title, I'm looking for romance, but I want an exciting story built around that.  I've pretty much done all genres that are out there, so I'm open to whatever you want, we can discuss that!  I'm on Central US time, and generally am available throughout the day and evening.\n\nI don't care about how long you've been roleplaying, as long as you're looking to write an engaging, exciting story with me!  I enjoy roleplaying flawed characters with depth and would hope that you enjoy the same.  Overpowered characters that have no weaknesses are boring to interact with.\n\nShoot me a message if you're interested in talking!  Feel free to ask me any questions that you have.  Thanks for reading!",

            "selftext": "Hello there everyone, I am looking for someone to roleplay a princess in a fantasy setting. As you might have guessed from the title I want this to be mainly a romance roleplay, but with a few twists.\n\nFirst of all, let me explain the setting of our rp, or at least how I imagine it, you can of course propose alterations if you want to!\n\n&gt; Our two kingdoms are at war over a region at the border which is renown for their many mines and capable Smith's. Neither wants to back down, the war having gotten worse and worse with every passing month.\nOne faithful day in autumn though this should all change, for it was the day you were captured. \n&gt; \nThe supreme general of your kingdoms forces had influenced the king to give your hand to his son so that he would become the next king, and eventually your father agreed, sending you off so you could meet your husband to be, no matter whether or not you agreed.\n&gt;\nWhile on your way to the front lines your chariot was ambushed by mercenaries who at first just wanted to kill you all so they could take whatever you carried with you. Pay at the front lines had become worse as the war continued, and they figured they could just steal whatever you head and run off.\n&gt;\nWhen they realized just who they had ambushed they instead smuggled you across the front lines and handed you over to the enemy army, figuring they would receive more this way. Whether or not they did is unknown to you.\n&gt;\nThough, it came as it must, and you soon found yourself in one of the enemy kingdom's cells. The only thing that could make this worse? That would be if your father decides to not negotiate, and simply leave you there to rot. But he wouldn't do that ... Right?\n\nAlright, so that's how I would plan for you to end up in your enemies cell, with your father not caring about you enough to negotiate your freedom. In this situation our characters would meet, and slowly a love would begin to bloom between those who should be enemies.\n\nThis could include some NSFW content later on if you are okay with that, but only if it fits into the story! If you aren't okay with NSFW content please let me know ahead of time.\n\nAllow me to also give you some more facts about me as a person:\n\n1. I have been roleplaying for almost 3 years now\n1. English isn't my first language, but I think I am fairly proficient with it by now (C1 certified)\n1. Due to me living in the EU and because I am sometimes rather busy I am looking for people who don't mind a slower pace. I should usually manage to get out at least a couple of messages a day, but sometimes I might be unable to. I will try to let you know in advance if that happens.\n\nIf all of that sounds interesting enough for you then shoot me a message, I am looking forward to hearing from you!\n\nThere are two things you should know when messaging me:\n1. Send me a DM - I don't check Reddit chat\n2. If I don't get back at you then I am sorry in advance, this plot has always been rather popular and I can guarantee that I won't get overwhelmed.\n\nHear of you soon!",

            "selftext": "Hello there, I\u2019m looking for a partner willing to join me in a scene that blends elements of Men in Black, Supernatural, and X-Files into a story that we can both enjoy. I prefer to write in 3rd person and using either Google Docs or Discord. I want world building to be as much a part of this story as fleshing out characters. \n\nThe main idea for this story is a world in which magic and the supernatural exist just beneath the notice of modern society. MASCC, the Magic and Supernatural Control Center, is responsible for ensuring peace between the supernatural and ordinary humans. Werewolves, vampires, dryads, withches, and the like exist as a sort of open secret among ordinary humans and it the duty of MASCC to see things remain that way. Your character is a MASCC operative assigned to a case in which an unknown supernatural being has killed innocents. My character would be a bounty hunter contracted to assist her. \n\nI am, of course, open to suggestions if there is anything about this very basic premise you\u2019d like to change. I am also open to romance and a certain amount of smut being elements in the story, so long as they don\u2019t become the central theme. Feel free to DM me if this idea sounds at all interesting to you and we can talk more about it.",

I roleplay on Discord preferably, or through email.\n\nI'm fully aware this is a very specific request. But a girl's got a hankerin' for some Far Cry 5 roleplay, and a girl's willing to ask.\n\nI have a few plots in mind for each, and **I'd love to double** so that you can enjoy your own pairing too! (Doesn't have to be FC5, I'm flexible and open to plenty of things.)\n\nMade it this far? Interested? Bless your heart. Pop me a message, and include \"Hail Sithis\" somewhere in there so I know you're not just jumping in on me! Thanks for your time and consideration! ;)",

I'm okay with NSFW stuff, but as I'm still pretty young I would just prefer nothing extremely gross haha\nI prefer writing in a first person, but I don't mind if you don't!

Knowledge of the game isn't necessary, though, as regular ol' Wild West characters and settings are fine by me as well. \n\nAs for characters, I'd be willing to play almost any of the main gang as well as a host of side characters, though my favorites are Arthur, Mary-Beth, Mary Linton, Sadie, John, and Abigail. I also have an OC ready to go if you'd like to check her out!\n\nI'll be accepting a bunch of characters as well as OCs, though I will say that I prefer M/F or F/F ships. \n\nAnd with that, I'll go ahead and list a few scenarios I had in mind concerning the main RDR2 cast! Spoilers for the game if you haven't finished yet!\n\n* AU where Arthur doesn't die because of course! The TB is negotiable as well\n* AU where Mary Linton actually ends up running off with Arthur and joins the gang. I'd be really interested in seeing how she gets on with the rest of the gang and the outlaw life. \n* Just something involving Sadie and Arthur. I'd love to see their relationship have a bit more \"screentime\" as it were. Maybe they go on more O'Driscoll hunting missions and bond a little more. I'd love to do something where they go off together and Saide gets wounded in the crossfire, forcing them to take shelter till things blow over. Maybe things go from there and *one thing leads to another*...\n* I'd also love to see more of John and Abigail's relationship. How it started, how things progressed, etc. \n* I'll also say that some Abigail/Arthur stuff would be awesome as well. Jack's parentage is still up in the air and maybe John or Abigail herself confronts Arthur about it. \n* And last but certainly not least, **Mary-Beth/Arthur.** I gotta be honest, I absolutely love Mary-Beth and would love to see more of her interactions with Arthur. I just have a bunch of different ideas of these two where their relationship progresses over the course of the main story/game. \n* ALSO, just some random ships I'd like to see would be John/Sadie, John/Mary-Beth, Sadie/Abigail, and Sadie/Mary-Beth. \n\nAnyway, that's about it! I'm open to about anything plotwise, so just shoot me a message if you'd be interested in having a rootin' tootin' good time! :)",

The reasoning on my end being that I've always wanted to run a text-based roleplaying game, so I can improve my narrative skill, and the one-on-one facet of it simplifying the process of scheduling conflicts. Hopefully this is where you come in.\n\nTo just shear off the fat as much as I can, let's just hop straight into what sort of story I'm hoping to run.\n\n\n\n* I'm very much interested in hosting something that takes place in a fantasy setting. I'm not all too picky on what form this story will take; Be it the gritty life of a soldier, or the high-fantasy adventures of a hedge-mage, I'm more than fine with running with whatever you want. The only stipulation on my end is that the story will be taking place in a fantasy setting, and that it's very much intended to be a narrative, where I'll be acting as a GM, and you a PC.\n* This is very much intended to be ran with someone that enjoys taking the time to write detailed descriptions, playing a character that feels like they're a part of the world, and working with me to make the story as enjoyable as possible. A shared narrative in between you and me will be at the top of the totem pole here.\n* Although I have no open stipulations against anything NSFW. I'm not intending this to be a thing where I can vent deviant urges on an internet stranger. If the story comes to a point where all manners of gore, injury, intercourse and disease need to be described, I won't be shying away, but this isn't explicitly intended to be ERP either.\n* Due to the nature of you, and your character, ultimately being the driving force behind where the story goes, and me not shying away from topics that fall under the NSFW category, I will only be accepting people who are 18+\n\n\n\n\n\nIf this sounds like something you'd be interested in and want to pitch me your idea for a character/story, or if you have any other questions, feel free to shoot me a direct message and I'll get back to you ASAP.",

            "selftext": "Hey! Sorry if the formatting is a little funky, I'm on mobile. Tried fixing it but this is as good as it's gonna get, haha.\n\nSo, about me:\n* 21 years old, usually in the GMT+2 time zone\n* Have a decade of experience, started in early 2009 on some online forums and have treasured roleplaying ever since\n* Advanced literate &amp; multi-para\n* Prefer to write male characters but totally cool with female ones too\n* Romance is often a key element in my roleplays but with two conditions: firstly, I love a slow burn and don't want to force the characters into anything that doesn't feel natural and timely, and secondly, I do clean roleplay only. I don't mind mature themes but I don't write smut. Additionally, I'm fine with MxF, MxM, and FxF.\n* Genre-wise, I'm a sucker for magical realism and themes of fantasy, reincarnation, lucid dreaming, fate, afterlife, etc. But I'm cool with anything really, just shoot your plot ideas at me freely. \n\n\nWhat I look for in a RP partner:\n* 18+, please\n* Be literate, have a solid command of the English language, good grammar \u2014 ya know, the basics\n* Be available on discord\n* Willingness and dedication to put thought into the characters and the plot! \n* For us to chat OOC as well and geek out over our story\n\n\nSo, here are a few plot ideas I have, though we're absolutely not limited to them. Feel free to suggest your own! \n\n1) THE LOOP. Character A and Character B are normal roommates/classmates/work buddies, etc, but upon getting closer, they begin to notice a strange sense of distant familiarity that neither can quite explain nor speak up about. They also begin to see unusual dreams revolving each other. Things escalate, they get closer and the roleplay runs its course, until one falls ill/gets into an accident/starts getting threatened by someone/gets into drugs/anything else that endangers their life. They die, eventually, and through suicide or simply by fate, the other follows months after. Then, another life begins. They get reincarnated in another country/time/city/whatever we decide, not knowing or fully remembering each other. But each loop, things get clearer and they remember more. They might even start trying to figure out ways to go back, end the loop, or start noticing menacing things going on. We've got endless possibilities.\n\n2) THE DREAM. Character A and Character B are whatever we want them to be \u2014 friends, lovers, enemies, etc. The roleplay runs its course, until they start noticing subtle things be off about their surroundings... Perhaps all clocks are frozen, or sometimes the lights flicker like the energy powering their world was running off. The truth is that it's all a dream; Character A has killed Character B for whatever reason and through his/her guilt had constructed a fantasy world of their own where Chatacter B is still alive. \n\n3) THE HUNT (I read this on Tumblr so it's not my own idea). In a world where you don't age past 18/20/whatever age until you meet your soulmate and then begin to age together, Character A is obsessed with the thought of immortality. When they run into their soulmate, Character B, they lure them in and kill them... but fate has other plans, and Character B keeps getting reincarnated. The characters turn into a morbid game of cat and mouse; with Character A plotting to get rid of character B for good and trying to find an end to the reincarnation (there is a way), and Character B already being somewhat in love or at least infatuated or interested in Character A and trying to convince them to give in to them. \n\n4) THE LIE. (I read this on r/WritingPrompts so it's again not my own idea). Character A is an immortal that can only be killed through heartbreak, and Character B has been hired to kill them. We can take the roleplay in any direction we wish.\n\n\nSo, please, let me know!",

            "selftext": "*The young knight in training lay on the hard ground, staring up at the cold night sky with a heart full of uncertainty, well, she figured she was an ex knight in training by now, and if that was the case then it also made her companion an ex prince(ss) too. She wanted to sleep. She felt exhausted, a day full of stress, sadness and nonstop running, her entire body yearned for sleep - even if just for a moment.*\n\n*But she couldn't - she had a job to do, after all. Protecting the last of the family she once swore loyalty to. Her dark blue eyes glance over at the huddled form of her companion, a slight frown on her face. It'd been a close call, and they had to stay undercover for now - she herself had left all of her armor behind, far too much of an indicator of who she once was, and who her companion was likely to be.*\n\n*And they were being hunted of course, the both of them knew that. After all, all of this was the result of a war that'd been in the making for decades, and an intense family rivalry behind it all. It was unlikely that their enemies were going to simply let the last remaining member of said rival family live, even if they no longer had any power - and maybe, no such desire to go back to that life or restore the kingdom.*\n\n*With a sigh she shakes her head, yawning and stretching out as she ponders on their situation, and just where they could go from here...*\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHello there! I'm new here, but i've got plenty of experience with RP so don't you worry about that. I hope that little write up caught your interest, and that perhaps you'd like to join me! \n\nSo a little more detail on the actual premise; the idea is that you're the prince or princess of a once powerful nation, ruled by a royal family that was known for their benevolence and kind nature, but seen as weak by other nations for it. One such nation invades, and succeeds in their goals.\n\nHowever, you and I escape. With me being a female knight in training who's last order from her since deceased captain was to keep you safe no matter what, and first of all, to get you out of the country and to somewhere where you could lay low. That'd take time though, and we're being hunted every step of the way.\n\nWhere we go to, what we get up to along the way, and how our relationship may change over time is all up for discussion! But as the title implies, i'd very much like romance to be a factor between our two characters. Perhaps it was feelings we held for each other prior to current events, finally allowed to happen given the situation we found ourselves in, or perhaps we never knew each other much personally before but now get to.\n\nAll of this said, i'd prefer someone 18+! Simply because i'm 23 and i'd be more comfortable playing with someone closer to my own age (but older is fine too). Particularly because I do like to include NSFW elements when it suits the story.\n\nAnyway, I hope this catches someone's interest! Hope to hear from you soon!",

            "selftext": "Hello there. I would love to have a story we can make together with the both of us constantly making ideas or character plots. I'd love for us to have development for our characters. I always wanted to do this idea but I was too afraid of rejection because it doesn't seem too exciting. \n\n\n**Basis of Plot-** I had an idea of a adult and child who travel the land together. Slowly they begin to adapt into a parent and child dynamic. I would rather be the adult here, and inside we can discuss plot points of the how, and where. Another concept would be two brothers or two sisters by this I don't mean by blood entirely but we can have them be adoptive brothers or just warming up to one another as they go on about surviving. Sisters works as well! If you haven't noticed yet I love the impending theme of family. \n\n\n**Requirements-** Quite frankly, I'm not too picky of a person. I do have one rule above all. Please try to understand that I am busy at times but when I am, I always let you know what's happening and when I will be back. Secondly, I love when someone can match with me with a novella style of writing. I prefer quality over quantity but, two paragraphs at the very least would settle with me. Like I mentioned above as well, I would like us *both* to come up with ideas as writers for certain arcs, and ideas on a enemy or whatever surprise you like to toss. It won't be all you, because I love to brainstorm things as well. Just **don't** speak for my character that's a big annoyance for me. Lastly, I'd like to mention how I don't use discord I don't have it and kik the word count is too little. I usually use Google Docs or we can use Reddit. \n\n\nI am passionate for lore and writing. I give it my all! So I hope you try to add in some effort as well. It can keep us going a long way. I promise I'm not uptight or serious I'm pretty laid-back as you get to know me. If you wish for the ooc chat to be only limited to RP Discussion than I am totally fine with that. It is also your choice if you wish to have a character sheet or not. I have a character that I wish to use but has been created already. I'd only tamper with the sheet and modernize him a little.\n\n\nYou can choose whichever race you'd like and the backstory of your choice. All I ask is that we communicate because it will get us quite far. I hope I don't let any of you down. Oh yeah, and the darker the RP the better. (Not really, I just love a Dark RP.)\n\n\nI will not answer Reddit Comments. Message me Directly and be sure to include which dynamic you what our characters as, your RP platform you would like, and whether or not Dark RP bothers you any. I can leave it out if it makes you uncomfortable! Make sure to tell me about yourself as well. Just make sure you made an attempt to try to read all of this.",

My english experience didn't start until 5 years ago. During the day I work at a daycare for people with mental disabilities and autism. During the night I rewatch the same series for the 7th time. It's a real hoot.\n\nI love writing, even if I'm not the fastest to respond. But the most important reason for roleplaying is making friends. I love talking to new people, whether it be about roleplays or other subjects.\u00a0\n\nI don't have a specific thing I am looking for. So feel free to suggest your ideas and I'll see if it speaks to me or not. Expect me to be pretty hype about whatever we are doing. Im the type to constantly spam my partner with images, ideas etc. I also like finding faceclaims, so there is that. If that isn't to your liking, feel free to say so. I will hold myself back.\n\nNSFW themed rps aren't an issue, so long as it doesn't take away from the plot.\u00a0\n\nSome of the fandoms I enjoy include Marvel, ASOIAF/GoT and The Witcher. I have a ton more, but these are the ones Im interested in for now. Im also a sucker for anything fantasy, mythology or western themed.\n\nId love to hear from some of you, and thank you for reading this thread.\n\nMuch love,\u00a0\n\nMunch",

While I do have some story prompts, I would generally prefer to work that out with my RP partner.\n\nPlease be able and willing to either NPC or play more than one character. I am. It is very difficult to have a good story with only two total characters.\n\nGenre preference: Fantasy or dark fantasy strongly preferred. Sci-fi if it is more Star Wars and less Star Trek. Modern only with a fantasy twist and if the world is particularly interesting. Cyberpunk is rad. Runepunk is cool. Give me some fantasy and I'm in generally. Super heroes?

Her family is gone, her friends are gone, and everything that she knew has been wrenched so cruelly from her grasp. Her life has become a long bout of misery, knowing pain in almost every waking moment.\n\nBut just because that long, painful part of her life is over, that doesn't mean that it isn't still with her. She is barely able to stand under her own power, and her mind is plagued by the horrors that she has endured. She is lost and scared, in a place that she does not know, and with no one that she can trust. She fears that this will be the end of her life, a final chapter where she dies alone, anonymously, in a place where no one cares about her.\n\nBut maybe... this isn't the end.\n\nI am looking for an RP where I play as this terrified, suffering Orc, and you are a kindly woman who has chosen to take me in and help me heal. I would prefer that you play as a witch, but any character ideas that you have, I would be very open to hearing.\n\nI would like for this to be a very light and tender RP. There may be some NSFW bits involving the background and what happened to my character, but we can talk about what elements you are okay with including before we begin the RP proper.\n\nI would love to find a partner to play this with, since this story has been on my mind for a long time now. So please, if you are interested, feel free to let me know.",

            "selftext": "Hi there, let me get straight to the point: I enjoy romance roleplays. Ideally, I prefer there to be romance. With said romance, I enjoy a slow burn, pace which makes sense, and actual chemistry between the characters (instead of saying \"Well, they gotta bang by tomorrow evening\" and then forcing it to happen). So, all in all, if that sort of thing isn't *your* thing, sorry - we're probably not going to match with our writing.\n\nThat being said, romance doesn't need to be the main point of the roleplay. I enjoy a good plot and while world building is fun, I am way more character driven. I will (and except you to) play only one main, fully fleshed out character, but there's no limit to the NPCs we introduce to keep the story going. When it comes to the plot, I very much enjoy stories set in (semi) isolated spaces - so characters living in a small town, working in an office together, maybe meeting during a hike and discovering some sort of mystery in the woods.\n\nA clash of personalities is always good to keep things going, whether it means one character being more feisty than the other, or one being a rookie at their job, or something else entirely. I am currently looking to play a female character and looking for a partner (male or female) willing to play a male.\n\nI roleplay in third person, past tense, using Discord - length of the post doesn't matter that much, but I try to keep it about two/three+ paragraphs. If interested, send me some info about something you've been dying to roleplay - hopefully we will be able to implement it!",

I'm looking to get back into it slowly with some good ole Sword and Sorccery kind of plots in a Fantasy world. It can be my Homebrew setting. Or most other established worlds. I'm always open to suggestions. \n\nThe same goes for plot. As I mentioned I want a kind of mismatched duo. A Ranger and a Princess. Thief and Soldier. Mage and Witch Hunter. (Again always open to suggestions). Ideally it would be a good mix of Action, adventure, some romance. \n\nDiscord is always my go to for RPs. Send me a DM if your interested. However keep in mind.

Drake   Shadowbourne to... do the 'honors' of starting the raping session, I...   went to the courtyard where they had her held to take a curious look.   Even from a distance, I was able to see and sense that she wasn't like   any other woman I've ever seen in my life before. She... was half-naked   basically, and... tied to a pole, but it wasn't her body that held my   gaze; it was that red hair of hers and... the beauty of her face. I was   able to tell, even from a distance, that she was magically beautiful.   And... I decided right there and then to save her... free her. Before   nightfall. It had to be before nightfall.\" Ryan narrates, pausing every   now and then to recollect different details or find the best words to   describe something.\n\n\"It wasn't  easy but... I managed to dupe the  drinks of the nearby guards before  the evening. And I stole the  cleanest-looking shirt and pants that I  could find among the belongings  of one of the female rogues in the  gang. And just as daylight was  fading, I sneaked back to the courtyard.  When I was a few steps away  from her, I... pulled the shirt off my  shoulder and held it with both  hands to... you know, cover her body  and... maybe reassure her.  However... just as I was about to wrap the  shirt around her somehow, she  looked at me.\" Ryan pauses for quite a  while and looks at the  red-haired woman laying unconscious on the bed  near him.\n\n\"At that  moment, I  could only see one of her hazel eyes, looking at me through  her red  bangs. And just one of her eyes was enough... It's hard... it's  really  hard to describe the storm of emotions of that moment. It was  like, she  pierced my soul with her eye, but not like a dagger pierces  flesh, you  know? It was more like... rays of light piercing through  thick  darkness, forcing their way through mountains of black, black  crust. I  felt a strange... goodness, like... a healing water or  something  washing over my heart and soul, even if just for a moment. At  the same  time... it was the first moment I saw her up close, and made  eye  contact with her. So... however beautiful I thought she was when I   looked at her earlier from a distance... it was nothing compared to the   beauty that graced my eyes when I saw her face to face for the first   time. I... fell in love with her right there and then. And I was ready   to die for her with a smile on my face.\"\n\nRyan  pauses again for a  moment, then looks at the old man sitting on a  chair nearby and says, \"I  already knew that I was taking a huge risk,  trying to free a captive in  the middle of a camp full of some of the  best assassins in the kingdom.  So when I realized at that moment that I  wasn't just gonna free her  but... I was also gonna leave with her, it  suddenly hit me that the  words 'huge risk'... couldn't even come close  to describing the dangers  I'd be exposing the both of us to. I was  probably better off just  freeing her and helping her escape. They  wouldn't have taken it so  seriously, then...\"\n\nA  look of regret overcomes Ryan's face for a  moment before he continues,  \"But I was in love. In one moment, my whole  world... maybe even my  very soul... changed. And deep down in my heart, I  knew that it would  never work out, that... she would never be truly  safe... if I wasn't  ready to die for her in a heartbeat. So... in a way,  the kind of love  that overcame me that evening... was the exact kind of  love that was  needed to protect her... but...\"\n\nRyan turns to look his unconscious beloved, then lowers his head in regret as he adds, \"It wasn't enough.\"\n\n\"Don't   despair, yet, child. You still did well, protecting her, so far,\" says   the old man. \"What about... your habit, though? How did you manage  after  leaving the organization and being cut off from your supply?\"\n\n\"I...   when I realized that I was leaving with her, I... stole quite a bit of   the product from the camp storage. I... had to kill one of the guards  in  the process. Of course... this, too, didn't help much in...  convincing  the organization to leave us alone. And... when I ran out of  that  supply, I... killed one of my ex-peers for what he had. Then...  she  helped purify me and eased my pain through the torturous cleansing   process... Do you think...\" Ryan stops mid-sentence, looks at his   beloved, and gulps as his eyes water a bit.\n\n\"Do you think that I was a curse... brought upon her, Master Alchemist?\" Ryan asks, his voice breaking a bit.\n\n\"No,   child, I think you did your best to save her, then protect her, with   the resources you had,\" says the old man with a reassuring, albeit a   little dispassionate, calmness. \"And what about... your bigger   challenges? An assassin, or... at least an ex-assassin and a religious   healer, together... you know? Did she help you with that, too? The   reformation.\"\n\nRyan drifts downward  with his gaze for a moment,  contemplating, then huffs through his nose  with a bitter smile and says,  \"No, Master Alchemist, I don't think  anyone can help you fight the  demons within you... not even an angel  like her.\"\n\nThen, Ryan  raises his  head to look at the old man and says with a tone of desperate  urgency,  \"Please save her, Master Alchemist! I'll bring you anything...  I'll do  \\[anything\\] for her.\"\n\n\"Only the  First can save us, child.  I can only provide the means of her recovery,  but it's up to Him to  make the means work, or not. And He has wisdom  in all things, even if we  can't see or understand said wisdom. I would  suggest praying but... I  understand that's not something you do,\"  explains the old man with the  same grounded calmness.\n\n\"Ask  the First to take me instead. I'm a  wretched soul anyway,\" Ryan pleads  with tears in his eyes, probably  crying for the first time in his  life.\n\n\"That's not how it works, child,\" offers the old man with the same dispassionate calmness.\n\nRyan   furrows his brow with an expression of frustrated misery as he stands   up, bringing his leather sleeve up to wipe his tears as he leaves,   intent on exacting revenge upon Shadowbourne, and everyone with him, for   what they have done to the only entity in existence he's ever truly   loved, the one girl who has taken all the love he never gave to anyone else.",

            "selftext": "Hello! \u00b4 \u25bd \\` )\uff89  \n\n\nI'm a 23/F who's looking for someone who's 18+ to RP with!  \n\n\nI'd like to preface this by saying that I currently have two long term RP partners (we're going on about 3 years now!) and while I do have 2-4 ongoing RPs with either of them at any given time , I'm really craving something different! One of my partners is really into high action and there's near constant BxB NSFW content, and the other has trouble really getting into different characters and progressing the story. They both have specific tastes, and while I'm happy to go along with whatever RP they're into, it does leave me wanting.   \n\n\nSo I guess what I'm really looking for is a new friend who enjoys RPing! \uff08 \u00b4\u2200\uff40\uff09\u2606   \n\n\nHere's a few base rules I have (some of which I didn't think I'd need):   \n\n\n* **Do not contact me with a bad attitude!** I am not here to stroke your fragile ego, nor babysit you. I am here to have a good time!  \n\n* **OOC Chatting is a must!** I can guarantee if we don't really vibe together, then our RP will fizzle out very quickly.   \n\n* **I need an OC!** I've learned that RPing as an Original Character is essential to my enjoyment of the RP. I am willing to play Canon characters (especially if you want whoever you're playing as to be friends/romantic partners with them), but I do need a plot that involves my OC to keep my interest.   \n\n* **Follow along with the story!** If I say the characters are on a bridge and then in your response they're suddenly in a tavern, it's really going to mess up the RP for me, and it's super annoying!  \n\n* **I like \"boring\" stuff!** I love having the downtime between intense scenes to really build the characters and their relationship. I love the slow buildup to the intense scenes! I love how the \"boring\" stuff can make the intense stuff more have more impact!  \n\n* **NSFW Content:** I am okay with having NSFW content, but I do not want the entire RP centered around it! I'd much more prefer if it happened naturally and wasn't forced or brought on too early.   \n\n* **I'm okay with DMing, but I want whatever RP we do to be a joint effort!** I want to make a world *with* someone, not just try and force someone's half-assed character through whatever universe they're in. I can't tell you how many times I've gotten 2-3 paragraphs from someone that somehow didn't advance the plot or further the conversation being had at all.   \n\n* **Don't expect me do DM for a fandom I know nothing about!** In fact, don't expect me to watch/read said movie/television show/book either.   \n\n* **Please be literate!** At least in the actual RP, you don't need to throw down any Shakespearean prose or anything, but I do need someone who knows how to properly place capitalization and punctuation at the very least. But I'm also super chill with mistakes being made, in fact I've probably made a few mistakes myself just writing this post! I'd also appreciate the writing to be in third-person, as first and second-person tend to make me a tad uncomfortable lol.   \n\n* **This is very important:** I will most likely **NOT** be responding to any RP daily-let alone multiple times per day. My brain just doesn't work that fast, and I'd never get anything else done if I tried lol. So I'd really appreciate it if you didn't pester me about it, or expect me to make some sort of exception for you! I like to really think about my responses, which can end up taking me a while. That being said, I usually get back to an RP in around 2-3 days, maybe 5ish if I'm struggling or very busy. But those are my usual response times, unless something comes up that delays me further, in which case I will inform you if something comes up!\n\nNow that that's out of the way, I can finally get to talking about the kinds of RPs I enjoy! Which is basically, anything!  \n\u30fe(\uff20\uff3e\u25bd\uff3e\uff20)\uff89 If you pitch an RP idea you've been itching to try out to me, chances are I'll be more than happy to go along with whatever you've got!  \n\n\nThe genres I most enjoy are horror (that can be mixed with anything because I love it so much), romance, sci-fi, slice of life, fantasy and mystery!  \n\n\nFor fandom RPs I generally like to use the universe they're in and not really interfere with the main plot of the story or the main characters, though I can make exceptions. But most of the time I just like putting OCs in as the main characters and seeing what happens!  \n\n\nSome fandoms I'm into are:  \n\n\n* **Legend of Zelda:** I've played almost every game out there!  \n\n* **Silent Hill:** I've played every game except for 1 and 2 unfortunately. But I can probably play through the The Room with a blindfold on at this point.   \n\n* **Haunting Ground:** Another game I can play forwards, backwards and sideways. I could probably also recite the cut scenes verbatim.  \n\n* **Resident Evil:** I've played most of the games, but oddly enough I think the only one I've beaten was 6! Which is strange because my favorites are definitely 2 and 4.  \n\n* **My Hero Academia:** I've only watched the anime, and I haven't seen the movie!  \n\n* **Mob Psycho 100:** I've only watched the anime!  \n\n* **Miraculous Ladybug:** I've only seen what's on Netflix!   \n\n* **Final Fantasy:** I've played so many of them, but somehow I've only completed FFXV.   \n\n* **Persona:** I've beaten 3 and 4 (though I don't remember 3 that well), and I'm partially through the 5th one!  \n\n\nThere are tons of others but I'm honestly blanking right now, so don't be afraid to ask me about specific fandoms!  \n\n\nI know this post is super long, and that along with the the amount of rules I have listed can make contacting me seem intimidating, but please don't be afraid to reach out to me! (=\uff9f\u03c9\uff9f)\uff89 Feel free to ask me any questions you may have, I'd be happy to answer them!  \n\n\nI'm really looking forward to hearing from you!

            "selftext": "Hello there!\n\nMy name is Jay, and I am a 20 year old woman currently living in Canada (Pacific Standard Timezone). I have been roleplaying for nearly 8 years now, and am most comfortable with writing between 3-6 paragraphs per post. However, I am a firm believer of quality over quantity, and struggle to write a ton in dialogue heavy moments.\n\nHere are some things about me:\n\nI am first and for most searching for a *friend; s*omeone who is interested in getting to know each other and chatting OOCly about our lives and our RP(s). Writing with others isn't just about the stories we tell, but learning about the person behind the written journey we're taking.\n\nSecondly, I am a full-time university student that also juggles a part-time job. I *love* being able to write multiple posts per day, but I won't be able to every single day. Sometimes, I might not have the time or energy to write at all, but I will try my best to keep you posted and still appreciate dumb memes and chatting in the meantime.\n\nThirdly, I will not write with anyone under the age of 18, even if we decide to not write anything NSFW. I will also not write underage characters in compromising positions. I'm an adult, and it's just kinda icky. \n\nWith that out of the way, let's discuss writing!\n\nI am comfortable writing both canon and OC characters, but I'm not a huge fan of putting OCs in a pre-existing world. I prefer crafting a world for said OCs with my partner. Of course, I'm always willing to be convinced!\n\nI'm a huge sucker for romance and can't get into a story without it. Now that being said, it doesn't always have to be the main focus, but I would prefer having it in the background at least. I am most interested in slow burn romances with a ton of pining and angst, but slice of life is still wonderful to me as long as there is some plot. \n\nI'm comfortable with all romantic pairings, but I have the most experience writing M x M relationships.\n\nHere are some fandoms I'm interested in. Within each one I'll list pairings I'm used to, with the character I'm comfortable playing listed first:\n\n\\- Good Omens (if you love Good Omens I will die the happiest of deaths) (Crowley x Aziraphale)  \n\\- Game of Thrones (Jaime Lannister x Brienne of Tarth, Sandor Clegane x Sansa Stark)  \n\\- Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency (Todd x Dirk) (comfortable with both)  \n\\- The Man from U.N.C.L.E (Napoleon Solo x Illya Kuryakin)  \n\\- Harry Potter (Severus Snape x Hermione Granger, Sirius Black x Remus Lupin, Severus Snape x Remus Lupin, Severus Snape x Harry Potter)  \n\\- Star Trek (James Kirk x Spock)  \n\\- Doctor Who (Nine x Rose Tyler, Ten x Rose Tyler, Thirteen x Yasmin Khan)  \n\\- Sherlock (John Watson x Sherlock, Mycroft Holmes x literally anyone, even OCs)  \n\\- Kingsman (Harry Hart x Eggsy Unwin)  \n\\- The Hobbit (Thorin Oakenshield x Bilbo Baggins)\n\nIf you don't see your fandom or pairing listed, please ask! I might have just forgotten one or two.\n\nThank you for reading my long-winded ramble!\n\nJay",

            "selftext": "I will quickly do a small introduction, so you get to know me a bit. At this point I am 21, I have been roleplaying for about four years by now. English isn't my first language, so there might or might not be some issues with my grammar or my vocabulary might not be that big. But I am always learning and improving. Until now I have mostly done K-Pop related roleplay, either in my native language and then english. Sadly I often found myself not being able to really develop my character as much as I wish to do. So I stumbled into here by chance and thought that might be my opportunity to find somebody who is willing to write with me. Writing is my passion and it just helps me to have somebody else, who fuels my inspiration and motivation. \n\nI am comfortable writing both male and female characters. As for genres, I am pretty adaptable. Because as long as it sparks something in my mind I am most likely to enjoy it. A genre that is difficult for me to write is horror. And a lot of times I just like a good sprinkle of clich\u00e9 in my stories, as well as romance. Until now I only wrote canon characters, but using an OC just sounds so fun to me, so I would always love to try that. I prefer to keep things as literate as possible and I mostly match the amount my partner has written. But a lot of times I just get really lost in scenes and because of that tend to write a lot.\n\nIt would be great, if we could talk a bit OC too. Bounce ideas off each other and just keep each other motivated and I made a lot of good friends while rping before. So that would be of course great but is definitely not a must. Regular replies are something I need, so keep the story and characters alive and moving. But life gets into the way sometimes, that's not a problem at all. Just let me know. \n\nA pairing I want to write really bad, is Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji from Grandmaster of Demonic Cultivation, or Mo Dao Zu Shi. Non of my friends are interested in the live-action, anime or manhua. But I love them all to pieces. At this point, I would like to play Wei Wuxian, if that's okay.  \n\n\nOther fandoms I consider myself a part of are for example Harry Potter and a lot of K-Pop groups. Sadly right now I can't think of more from the top of my head. But just feel free to ask me! \n\nThings I enjoy writing are: royalty or historical settings, soulmates, guardian angel, angel and demons and generally some more fantasy-themed topics. Slice of life is always more than welcome as well. Topics that play with the idea of good and evil are always fun too. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you are interested or have any questions don't hesitate to shoot me a message.",

Explore a vast and rich world ripe with mature and visceral conflicts, grey morality, political clashing, and magic with your own character, molded to the universe to create something uniquely for you! Be wary, though, for danger lies within every corner of the Witcher world and here, it is no different. Ancient forces clash, monsters prowl the lands, political cabals control from the shadows, magic permeates the land and deathly diseases afflict its people.\n\nIn New Dawn, you will start your journey by creating your own character, selecting from a variety of different races from humans to nonhumans to even supernatural ones such as vampires and werewolves! Employed within the Guild of Silver, your character can start off of a simple craftsman, a monster slayer, a mage, and more, embarking on whatever quest you deem worthy for yourself. Become the greatest warrior to have walked the Continent and the Isles or mold yourself into its most famous craftsman, should you so choose.

However, there was more to it than just a country losing and another winning. \n\nThings that were once thought to be myth and legend were now part of gossip and rumor. News of cattle being taken by goblins and trolls, fairies playing tricks on people, the undead taking over graveyards; people were beginning to wonder what was going on. Whispers and tales were that these problems were caused by powerful demonic creatures that were pulling the strings of this change. \n\nThese demons were slowly tearing away at the veil separating the spiritual from the physical world. Making it easier for them to pass through and influence things in the mortal realm. But with them comes other beings some benign while others were plainly chaotic. \n\nHumanity was now caught in the vortex that was about to come and they will need to adapt if they wish to survive.\n\n___\n\nHiya! So thats just a short setting description for the world I hope to build with you. I plan on starting it small and going bigger as we go along, but generally I'm hoping for a dark fantasy world in the vein of berserk and maybe a bit of warhammer. Little bit about me, I'm a guy in my late 20's hoping to find a writing partner of a similar or at least close to my own age. I also write and RP as a hobby since I have a full time job so I dont expect the most amazing writing but a grasp of grammar would be nice. I write about a paragraph or two and prefer a good be of story and character development in my RPs so I was hoping we could work on things with that in mind. \n\nI'm also supposed to mention that NSFW themes can be explored but lets not make it the focus of our story. Romance is alright as long as it makes sense. Thats about it, I think. Anyway lets talk and adjust as we go along. Have a great day and thanks for stopping by.",

Servers can be cumbersome, and discord group chats just aren't as appealing. I'm willing to try different platforms if you can think of a good one, though.\n\nI almost exclusively play male characters, and almost exclusively prefer **MxM** ships. I can play multiple background characters in my replies, but too much and it becomes cumbersome. I'd prefer someone who can also supply at least the bare minimum of bg character dialogue/actions when convenient to the story. I love trying a lot of diverse scenarios and just exploring whatever content we think of and desire. Canon divergence and alternate universes are encouraged.\n\nNow for characters I'll play and the fandoms they're from. I'm willing to try other characters from these fandoms, though. I'm a polyshipper, so most of these are parts of a ship I'm interested in.\n\n**Fandoms:**\n\n* **X-Men**: Pietro Maximoff (Quicksilver), Warren Worthington III (Angel), Kurt Wagner (Nightcrawler)\n   * (specifically, apocalypse, but open to other canons)\n* **My Hero Academia:** Katsuki Bakugo, Hitoshi Shinso, Izuku Midoriya, Denki Kaminari, Neito Monoma, Mashirao Ojiro, Hanta Sero, Fumikage Tokoyami, Yo Shindo\n* **Castlevania:** Trevor Belmont, Alucard, Hector\n* **Miraculous Ladybug:** Adrien Agreste, Luka Couffaine, Marc Anciel, Nathaniel Kurtzberg\n* **Star Wars:** Kylo Ren\n* **Haikyuu:** Kenma Kozume, , Tobio Kageyama, Kei Tsukishima, Tadashi Yamaguchi Takanobu Aone\n* **MCU:** Bruce Banner, Loki Laufeyson, Peter Parker\n* Ask about any other fandoms/ships/characters because this is all I can think of right now.",

While you were at her place, you managed to get her WiFi password and we\u2018ve been using it ever since. Though something was strange today; while watching some shows on Netflix, we noticed some download onto our phones - an app. None of us knew the app, what it was or where it came from. Once it finished downloading you opened it, seeing a scanner that allowed you to scan people you point it at. You scan me and see multiple options come up that allow you to change my gender, age, race, even species and other things.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested send me a message with your Kik or discord",

I'm back yet again, hopped up on an insane amount of caffeine, and ready to rumble!\n\nNow in today's RP ad, we'll be focusing on anime/manga.\n\nI want you to know, I'm taking a huge risk by making this post at 3 a.m. Oooohhhhh\n\nNow I prefer the ease of role playing in a world where the setting, and plot is already there, but I prefer to use original characters.\n\nI am also a big fan of doubling.\n\nI prefer to use original characters.\n\nI am also a big fan of doubling. \n\nI had to say that twice, because I get people who read my ads and then ask me questions that were answered in my ad.\n\nUsually this means we both play a character that we've made against a Canon love interest.\n\nI will roleplay here, Discord, and email.\n\nThe biggest thing I want from you as a partner, is just that you actually interact with me. Everyday I get on a site like Discord, and I see four or five of my friends online and not one of them will say anything to me until I message them first like somehow it's my job to be the one to make our partnership stay alive.\n\nMy average length is a few paragraphs I would say. Word count wise It's about anywhere between 300 to 600 words per side.\n\nI am open to alternate universe settings. \n\nNow for the list;\n\nMy Hero Academia\n\nOne Punch Man\n\nHellsing\n\nNaruto\n\nBleach\n\nOne Piece\n\nCowboy Bebop\n\nTerraformars\n\nAttack on Titan\n\nTrinity Blood\n\nWell, that's it for this post! Now I'm going to put a bunch of junk inside of a box and then tell people that I got it off the dark web.\n\nSeriously though, if you want to role play with me my door is pretty much always open and I like to think that I'm laid-back enough to take just about anyone.\n\nThanks for reading.",

            "selftext": "I literally couldn't think of a better title than that, I swear.\n\n\nThat aside, Hello! I'm back, today looking for less of a prompt, and more of a...general search? I have no idea. Before I get into the nitty gritty, allow me to say a bit about myself. I'm a 20-something male with plenty of writing experience, about 6ish years or so. I'm the kind of guy who (proudly) sprouts absurd and out there ideas, literally just on a whim or the slightest bit of inspiration. Seriously. Sometimes I can get a little crazy. My post length is anywhere between 1-3 paragraphs, but I came definitely get more out if I'm feeling inspired.  I'm also, for whom it might concern, in the central timezone of the United States. That being said, I have a horrid sleep schedule, so I'll usually be up pretty late into the night.\n\n\nWith that out of the way, let me say what I'm looking for. I am (unsurprisingly) looking for a female partner to nerd out with, 18+ of course, just in case we *do* go down a NSFW road at some point (It's welcome, but I'd like to not to be the focus of anything). **I will not, under any circumstances, write with someone under the age of 18**. I'm not comfortable with it, and I'm sorry if someone out there disagrees with this. Additionally, I'm looking for someone that I can call my friend. All proper and business is boring. I like to freak out with my writing partners. Come up with dumb plotlines or AUs. If you're looking for something strictly professional, I'm probably not your guy.\n\n\n\nFinally, we get down to what I'm *really* gonna be vague on. As you might've guessed by the title, I'm looking for something fantasy related. What specifically, you might ask? I have no clue. I'm a sucker for romance plots, with an epic adventure hanging above our characters' head. Be it slaying gods, or sealing away an ancient evil, I can't get enough of it. I love all sorts of different fantasy races, too. Elves? Oh yeah. Demons? Sure! Any kind of Yokai? *my god, that'll press my buttons in juuust the right way*. That being said, anyone that brings an idea with **Kitsune** as a major emphasis will make me *very* happy. Anyway. If you have any existing ideas, please, throw them at me! I love reading through plots n ideas. Want to create something new? We can chat for a bit, and see what we both like.\n\n\nI'm rambling now, aren't I? I think I've gone on for long enough. If I've caught your eye, please, shoot me a message, and I'll get to you ASAP. I get a lot of messages, so I'm sorry if I don't get to you right away. Some messages also slip through the cracks, or don't follow a certain obvious rule, so sorry on that regard as well. Just be sure to include your favorite color in your title, so I know you got down this far. I won't respond without it, because I don't enjoy it when people don't read my post. Like I said, I'm usually around into the late hours of the night, so you'll likely catch me. Thanks for reading!\n\n\n(Oh, by the way, don't send me a message only saying \"hey I think we can work something out\" or the like. Tell me about yourself, have some energy. Those kind of intros give me life)",

            "selftext": "Hi, I'm looking for a rp partner on discord for a roleplay I created loosely inspired from the anime: Fate/Stay Night. The inspiration being someone being able to summon a spirit from the past and being able to form a contract with them. This may sound rude but if you are interested in the prompt I'm not really looking for small-talk.. I know that sounds bad but  I kinda just wanna rp and not be asked how am I, or how my day is going etc. Sorry.. Not really. Anyhow here is the scene, if you are interested please message me and I will happily give you my discord.  \n\n\n\"Contracted Spirits.\" Strong beings from the past who died with strong regrets in their heart. They can connect with those who are living in the present, only if certain requirements are met.. The person must be holding a relic that belonging to the spirit, and then the summoner must offer a drop of their blood to form the contract. Once that is done the connected spirit will become their servant and protecting their summoner from anything that might danger them.. What did this mean to you? Nothing, it was only a children's tale your parents would tell you before you went to bed. You never believed in the supernatural because you were a very logical person. Everything had a scientific answer. However, you always kept this necklace your mother gave you when you were younger. It was a simple metal cross that was tilted 45 degrees to the left, with a strange gem in the center. One day you decide to take a vacation to Switzerland, you had just earned a promotion and thought it was time you treated yourself for a change. After going through a harsh breakup, you wanted some time alone and far away from anyone you knew. You stayed in a beautiful resort in the mountains, taking a hike on the second day to clear your mind. As you were hiking up the mountains you noticed a strange path.. Always being an adventurous type you took the path, leading you to a strange clearing. There were giant stone pillars with strange blue markings across the structures, along with what looked to be an alter in the center. As you approached the alter your necklace gently started to shake, the gem in the center glowing ever so gently.   \n\n\nYou were too interested in the alter to notice, you moved your hand along the jagged alter until you feel a sting. When you inspect your hand you see that you cut yourself by accident.. The requirements were met. You finally noticed your necklace that glowed brighter now, and then as you turned the stone pillars were glowing a bright blue in response to what had happened. Suddenly everything went white, then you saw visions. You were standing alone, the same place but.. different. The ruins were restored as if they were never broken, when you looked up towards the sky it was as if you could see the entire galaxy, everything was clear. You heard the cries of a woman shouting in a strange language, and the sound of men yelling back. Before you could even move you were back at the alter.. this time you weren't alone. A woman sat on the alter, holding her face in her hands. She looked up at you slowly, removing her hands from her face \"Who.. are you..\" She says in a somber tone. (My character's name is Ymir and she is only 20 years old. She has long blonde hair that falls to the end of her back with unnaturally bright, almost crystal blue eyes. She stands at 5'3 and has a slim but toned build, alabaster skin with strange blue  tattoos covering the entire left side of her body stopping at her face, with the exception of a small blue line under her left eye that goes down only two inches. She has a soft and angelic voice, paired with a noticeable German accent. In this scene she is wearing a tattered white and gold dress that falls down to the middle of her knees with gold gladiator-styled sandals. If you are interested please describe your character and continue.)   \n\n\n  \nSidenote: I've written your character to not be interested in the supernatural, however if you want to change that. Say maybe you were intentionally trying to form a contract with a spirit, that's perfectly fine with me just let me know.",

I usually post around 1 paragraph, sometimes less. I try to make up for the short length with quality. \n\nI\u2019m looking for a partner who can post somewhat consistently. Maybe 3-4 times a day or more if we both get the chance. \n\nI\u2019m looking to do a romance plot but in a cyberpunk, post-apocalyptic, sci-fi or Fantasy setting. I\u2019m not opposed to established settings but I don\u2019t like playing OCs or with OCs. \n\nSo if you\u2019d like to try and discuss more shoot me a pm and we can try and figure out something that works for us both.",

            "selftext": "Hey all! Looking to make use of an established setting of mine for a new campaign on discord; be that with a single protagonist, or a group of differently-minded investigators.\n\nDespite the grandiose premise of a world in which Victorian England's folklore was as lively as its rising industry, the overall tone aims for relative pseudo-realism. There are those who attempt to tackle spiritual objects scientifically, and indeed those who try to come to terms with scientific objects spiritually- but everyone has to face certain realities, be they cruel or kind, which might go against their world view.\n\nYour character might be a once reclusive witch, a militant Witchfinder with no such sympathies for the occult, a Doctor with an intellectual grudge against all things supernatural, or indeed an Alchemist looking to view all things objectively. A party of all four or similar sorts sounds as likely to solve the most arcane of unsolved mysteries as it would be to destroy itself from within.\n\nFeel free to PM me if this interests you. A writing sample would be terribly appreciated; with a love for History, the English language and literature never going amiss either.\n\nCheers!",

We're based in a quiet, remote North American town completely cut off from the rest of society. In this alternate universe, Vampires have managed to dwell and thrive in this relative peace - arriving and populating the majority of the town, pushing the human population down to around 50%. Here, you'll pick whether you live as a regular human, a hunter, or a vampire. It's 2019, after all, and people tend not to discriminate. But, despite the harmony, there are always people on both sides that are born with natural contempt for their opposites.

The baying of hounds reverberated through the Twisted Wood, mixed with the shouts of knights of The Fold.\n\nThe Festival of Fall seemed a safe enough time and place to enter Torgaau \u2013 travelers from all over the continent would be there. The festivities included traders with goods from all edges of the land and even across the sea. Performers and beautiful dancers, manipulators of flame. Not to mention the food, the warm, glorious food from faraway lands. Everyone was walking around in masquerade wear to celebrate the changing of the season \u2013 the full moon burned orange and high. What\u2019s a bored young witch to do?\n\nFor a moment she let her darker mind chase the rabbit down the hole. *If they caught me, how would I die? Burnt alive like those before me? Bled dry before the crowd? Hung with rough ropes around my neck? Brand me and keep me for their own uses?*\nHer thoughts stopped there. She couldn\u2019t let her mind go to that place her sisters had been taken. She had only just seen them scantily clad, in iron barred cages in the square. She supposed in retrospect she had caused quite a scene when she summoned a shadow creature to distract the crowd while she attempted to free them. She knew she broke the padlock, she watched the metal cave from her telekinetic power, but she had to run before she could see if any had escaped.\n\nHer steaming breath clouded around her as she swallowed hard and began to summon branches to fall behind her as she bolted past old trees.\n\n*I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry!* She fretted at the ancient boughs as they crashed behind her summons, proving an obstacle for her hunters or tinder for an accidentally dropped torch.\n\nShe heard louder shouting and knew they were meeting her obstacle, but suddenly an arrow whizzed over her left shoulder.\n\n*Gods,* she gulped air hungrily and didn\u2019t dare look back. She spurred on her steed and closed her eyes, focusing her power for a final blow to throw her pursuer off her scent.\n\n~~\n\nHello! Thank you for reading this far! I am 25/F/EST searching for a partner to wrist a witch/witchhunter roleplay. Its coming up on that spooky time of year and I think this theme would be fun to pursue. I am an experienced roleplayer and use discord or google docs. I am searching for someone as literate as myself, I write several paragraphs per post and can reply several times a day on days that I do not work. I am an adult in the working world (though I work at night, and only 3-4 days a week) and do have real world responsibilities but will promise at least one response on nights I work. I also require that you are 18+ as I am hoping for lowkey violence/romantic/not safe for work themes and scenes.\n\nPlease do message me if this interests you! I am flexible, you could be a fellow sorcerer and we are both being pursued, maybe we are enemies, maybe you offer me shelter and realize I\u2019m a witch! Or maybe you are the skilled hunter assigned by The Fold (the religious/witchhunting authority in this universe I\u2019ve created) to find me and kill me or bring me in. And maybe I find a way or two or three to change your mind along the way.\n\nThis is a universe I am sharpening, I do have a loose magic system and will play more than one character when the time comes. I love getting to know partners outside the RP, and appreciate any feedback on my writing!\n\nHave a wonderful night everyone \ud83d\ude0a",

I\u2019m open to Sci-fi, Fantasy, Historical, Military, and a bunch of other roleplays, I would like to do Slice of Life. I\u2019m also willing to incorporate other types of roleplay into the original one.\n\nI\u2019m pretty laid back, I only really ask that whoever messages me be active. I get that people get busy, as I can get very busy often, but at least let me know. If you don\u2019t like the roleplay, let me know so that we can either change it or so that you can leave; don\u2019t just disappear, though. If anyone\u2019s interested, please do let me know and we can trade ideas and talk about each other\u2019s limits. Thanks!",

To man, this wasn't seen as a tragedy, instead, it was a revolution of evolution, the next era of humanity, the next generation, a reward \u2014 simply called: quirks; a reward for YOU to reap the benefits of to seek vengeance or help the weak. What will it be?\n\nIgnoring my friends flare in this draft, I'm looking to be blunt. I want a rather weird setting, in terms of this play. One that'll really baffle the mind and stick with you. I want to work with my fellow rpers and build scenes around their characters whilst guiding them through the \"main\" plot that I'm slowly crafting. I want to see bizarre designs and quirks whilst I return the sentiment in kind. I'd like a mature cast that'll explore the world itself. Being taken through a class here and there, the villain attacks, mysteries. Or, take a field trip to Southern Africa where quirked animals lead by a Jellyfish run the literal animal kingdom in a fun mix up for the setting. That's what I want more than anything. A fun time, and to share it with you all.\n\nThe server's community should be nice and treat each other with respect (I hope); though I share the empathy that it'll likely not be for those that cannot handle criticism or rude humor, so I feel this will need to be a server for folks that have thick skin. I've seen too many fall to ridiculous arguments and fights that shouldn't have happened.\n\nOn that note, we're currently looking for:\n\n\u25cf Active players.\n\n\u25cf Original concepts.\n\n\u25cf Folks with a bit of thick skin.\n\nAnd that's about it! Pretty relaxed server, hoping to make a good story with all your help \u2014 hope to see ya there! Just shoot a DM and I'll bring ya in.  \n[https://discord.gg/EAdKNNz](https://discord.gg/EAdKNNz)",

Usually, I get on well with people over 25 but if you're younger than that we can give it a try.  I write in 3rd person, I tried 1st person but it's too limiting for me and I find myself unconsciously writing back in 3P. Bollocks right.\n\nThe story I'm looking at is a royal exchequer (M) to a principality far into the future who is beholden to his loyalty to the royal family but does not agree to the policies their monarch implements. He finds an ally to my character (F), a member of the royal family and is involved in the military operations of the family.\n\nI am open to suggestions if this doesn't work for you of course.  I am also open to smut elements but I prefer it not to be the central theme. Send me a DM if interested and we'll take it from there.",

            "selftext": "The Hand has fallen.\n\nThanks to the efforts of a group of New York heroes, the leadership of the clan is in tatters, scattered to the wind. Various would be leaders rise and attempt to unite the fractured Hand, but are quickly dispatched by their rivals. All save one\u2026\n\n[Matsu'o Tsurayaba](https://i.imgur.com/xT9tSLW.jpg) was seen as a talented young upstart in the Hand\u2019s Japan branch. As charismatic as he was deadly, many of the Fingers saw Matsu\u2019o as a potential threat. He was kept down, his assignments sabotaged and closely monitored. Eventually, Matsu\u2019o got sick of this treatment and defected to the Yakuza.\n\nNow with the Hand in ruins, and Matsu\u2019o a successful oyabun, he sees his opportunity to remake the Hand in his image. But he would need more than his underlings to retake the Hand, he would need a weapon. An luckily, he has just what he needs. Whispered among the Underworld are tales of Matsu\u2019o unseen right hand. An assassin whom no one living has ever laid eyes upon, save Matsu\u2019o himself.\n\n\\---\n\nSo, there\u2019s two ways we can go with this:\n\nKwannon:\n\nKwannon is Matsu\u2019o\u2019s secret weapon, an assassin able to cloud the minds of her targets and slip in and out unseen. Originally another ninja of the Hand, she met and fell in love with Matsu\u2019o, and shared his frustration at his treatment by the Hand\u2019s leaders. When he defected she wanted to as well, but couldn\u2019t bring herself to leave her home. But all that changed when the Fingers were defeated in New York. The Hand was left leaderless, and her beloved Matsu\u2019o had begun to make moves to pick up the pieces. She rejoined his side, eager to do all she can to make his ambitions a reality.\n\nPsylocke:\n\nElizabeth Braddock seemed to have it all. An agent of the espionage organization S.T.R.I.K.E and a model, Elizabeth was beautiful and powerful, her telepathy giving her an edge against her foes. But one mission would go wrong, in an attempt to infiltrate the Ten Rings, Elizabeth was discovered and nearly killed. Her body was found by an ally of the Twn Rings\u2019s leader, Matsu\u2019o Tsurayaba, and he noted an uncanny resemblance the woman had to his own lost love, Kwannon, who\u2019s been fatally injured when she was sent to assassinate him after his defection from the Hand. He took the broken Elizabeth to Japan and, through the sorcery and alchemy of allies who\u2019s left the Hand with him, brought Kwannon back to life with Elizabeth\u2019s essence, creating a fusion of the two women. Psylocke serves Matsu\u2019o faithfully, but feels the call of a mostly forgotten life\u2026\n\n\\---\n\nThis will be a mix of romance, espionage and drama. Matsu\u2019o seeks to rebuild the Hand under his vision, a worldwide organization with more in common with the Yakuza and a focus on power and weath rather than a cult of immortality seekers. He seeks to modernize the clan, investing in high technology and modern tactics, rubbing traditionalists the wrong way. Opposed are those same traditionalists, along with other lords who want to seize control themselves. In the middle of all this is you, as either Kwannon or Psylocke, Matsu\u2019o\u2019s lover and secret weapon.\n\nMy preferred venue is Discord. Thanks for reading!",

            "selftext": "Hey they, kind explorer of Reddit. Thanks for stopping by. Now, I've had some pretty bad luck with this place and ghosting, but I'm still looking to try, if only for now. Gotta get my daily dose of escapism somehow! Let's get right into business, shall we?\n\nHere are some of my interests, though I've probably got more. Feel free to ask!\nGenres\n- Sci-fi\n- High Fantasy\n- Horror\n- Survival/Survival Horror\n- Exploration\n\nFandoms\n- Marvel \n- Watchmen\n- Dark Souls (This isn't actually something I'd be able to write, I just really enjoy it!)\n- Fallout, or really anything post apocalyptic\n- Ben 10\n\nThings I just like\n- Monsters/Abominations\n- Superheros\n- Well written and interesting characters\n\nOkay, so, as you can see, I'm kind of a nerd. If you're nerdy, you can feel free to message me. Not even for RP, just in general. I love discussing some nerd stuff. I don't have many rules, or requirements, but what I do have are important and so I think I should mention them!\n\n1. Please please please please! Don't message me if you don't think you'll be able to write a decent bit regularly. I'm not saying we'll be making huge novels of posts, but if you can't write in the 3,000-4,000 range, and be ready to potentially write more if I end up getting real into the Roleplay, I'm sorry to say this won't be all too fun for me or you!\n\n2. If I say something makes me uncomfortable, which is rare since I'm fine with most things, please don't try to push it, because I'm not going to give in. If it makes me uncomfortable, it means it genuinely makes me feel uneasy and I'd like to refrain from it in the future.\n\n3. I'm not super into using pictures for characters. Call me old fashioned, but I've always preferred actually describing characters in their bios instead of using photos, and I'd like for my partner to be able to do the same. That doesn't mean I'll flip if you draw your character and want to show me, I'd just prefer a written description in their biography.\n\n4. Be active. I'm not going to ask you to absolutely give me all of your time or anything, but be available to talk to often and let me know when you won't be. I believe communication is a really big part of a successful Roleplay.\n\n5. Just talk to me, really. I like being friends with who I roleplay with!\n\nOkay, I've got my rules and my interests. That's about it. Though, if you're like me and you didn't notice the \"Discord,\" in the title, I'll leave you this.\n\nREMEMBER THIS IS AN AD FOR PEOPLE ROLE-PLAYING ON DISCORD.\n\nAnyway, can't to see who responds to this. Have a lovely day!",

            "selftext": "Hi, hello! \n\nBuckle up kids, this is kinda long. \n\nI\u2019m an avid writer and have been roleplaying online since, well, forever. You remember when internet chat rooms first became a thing? Hello Rhy\u2019din. I was there. I\u2019ve spent over twenty years creating this way. \n\nRecently I\u2019ve taken a break (uncharacteristic for me) and after six-ish months in the real world am finally ready to give RP worlds a go again. I\u2019m starting with a clean slate partner wise. \n\nTranslation: I\u2019m old, and pretty darn good at this whole story telling thing. I\u2019ve also been around long enough to know what works for me and what doesn\u2019t so please don\u2019t take offense if you\u2019re not my cup of tea. I prefer to be straight forward about things like that so as not to create disappointment down the road. \n\nSo, what I\u2019m looking for:\n\n- Someone to play a straight male leading character(s) against my straight female leading character(s). As the writer you can be a man, a woman, or a purple raccoon if it suits you. You do you. It\u2019s the character that matters. Sorry, I don\u2019t double. I\u2019m bad at playing men as anything more than the occasional NPC and it\u2019s not fun for me. Happy to play a dozen leading ladies if you like though. \n\n- Write in the third person.\n\n- Make a story come alive through detail in both description and dialogue. I\u2019m a paragraphs to novellas type writer. Minimum 4 paragraphs per post, above that is great, less than that and I will not be able to remain engaged. \n\n- MUST be over 25. Older? Better. \n\n- Have a reasonable grasp of grammar and spelling. Perfection isn\u2019t necessary by any stretch, just make an effort.\n\n- Be a collaborative part of world building, plotting, and character introduction and development. I am not and do not want to be the narrator, this is an equal weight kind of thing. \n\n- Long term only. Multiple worlds, multiple plots, lets have fun. \n\n- Write via email or GoogleDocs only. Sorry, I don\u2019t Kik or Discord. \n\n- Accept that I have a life and a career and relationships beyond the screen. Sometimes I can write quickly, other times it\u2019s a post every other day or two. Let\u2019s keep it casual. Real world comes first. Whatever time zone you\u2019re in is fine. \n\n- On that same note, I\u2019m okay with casual conversation now and then, but I\u2019m not looking for anything more from a writer. \n\n- Plots must contain romance but also need to contain elements of action, adventure, and drama. I don\u2019t do plain old slice of life, I\u2019m here to escape the real world, so slice of James Bond\u2019s life? Cool. Slice of Mary Sue Housewife\u2019s life? Blah. \n\n- No canon characters or fandoms. Double no to anime. It\u2019s not my thing. I admittedly have a weakness for the Winchester\u2019s so that miiiiiiiight be the one exception. \n\n- Tough guy character types wildly preferred. I like life experience and flaws. Tattoos, scars, whatever. Strong personalities, no wilting violets. \n\n- No futuristic or sci-fi. Post-apocalyptic is a mayyyyyybe if there\u2019s a good plot. Pretty much anything historic is cool. I\u2019m good with fantasy to a certain degree. Modern is also okay. Supernatural elements are adored. Epic? Even better. \n\n- NSFW, also fine in the context of the story. Fade to black works too. No complaints either way. \n\n- Don\u2019t ghost. Let\u2019s be adults and discuss anything that isn\u2019t working. Honesty is best. \n\nThat was a lot, so thank you for hanging in there. I promise, I\u2019m nice, I\u2019ve just been around the block enough that I know what I like and what works. Easier to get it out of the way up front so that we can both start on the same page! \n\nIf you\u2019ve got a few ideas marinating I\u2019d love to hear them. Toss me a DM and we\u2019ll see if we can come to an accord. \n\nIf I\u2019m not your cup of tea, happy hunting.",

            "selftext": "Hey there!\n\nRoleplay was a huge interest of mine all through high school and college, from table top games to play-by-post. I lost touch with many of the people I used to RP with as life went on, but recently I've really come to miss building a story with someone or a group of people.\n\nI would consider myself a literate roleplayer and am most comfortable in third person. I have a relatively large list of interests when it comes to genre/settings, but I'm particularly fond of sci-fi and fantasy. I'm not opposed to utilizing fandoms or other pre-existing worlds, but original stuff is super awesome too! While I am, as seen in the title, a lady, I have been known to and often do play a variety of characters, including male and nonbinary characters; it depends on what fits. I am also quite a bit older than 18 (and 21, as I've seen constraints for both).\n\nI think a group RP would be ideal, but I'm not opposed to 1x1s, assuming our writing styles mesh well and we have similar interests. So, if you've got an interesting idea or a question about anything written here, just shoot me a message!",

            "selftext": "Greetings! Been a while since I\u2019ve done one of these. To keep it simple, I\u2019m looking for a female to partake in some quality roleplay within a Star Wars or Medieval/Fantasy universe. Being that I\u2019ve been a die-hard fan of SW for as long as I can remember, I pride myself in knowing much of the lore spanning both the Canon and Expanded universes. My experience with Medieval/Fantasy mostly comes from past roleplay and RPG experiences, and of course, my preferred hobby of D&amp;D.\n\nThis roleplay will feature a fair amount of action and drama, as well as a romance between our two characters and even some slice-of-life mixed in. I\u2019m happy to discuss deeper plot details once we establish a medium, preferably Discord for convenience.\n\nI have some characteristics that I\u2019d much appreciate my partner to share; Fair grammar should be expected from both sides. Activity is a must, as often as you can. I do appreciate OOC discussions and chatter, better to build a friendship than a partnership. I myself prefer 3rd-person past tense, and am happy to give at the very least one paragraph each response, depending on the nature of the roleplay. Communication is a must regardless, in order to prevent ghosting and to confirm scheduling. Timezone doesn\u2019t matter much to me, as long as we have a window often enough to allow meaningful progress. That being said, my timezone is PST.\n\nIf this caught your eye, please PM me here on Reddit and I\u2019ll be happy to strike up a dialogue. Please give me a bit of information pertaining to yourself in your message, for the sake of convenience. Here\u2019s hoping to a fun, meaningful roleplay experience!",

            "selftext": "Hey guys!  Guess what, I'm still *looking4trouble* haha. Trying to find a happy medium I decided to make a simple yet extensive thread. It shows not only my preferences but also hopefully will expose all the possible differences between us. Under \"Compatibility Check\" I'm highlighting those aspects that I found me and potential partners were sometimes not matching at in the past.\n\nGo ahead, check this out and lemme know if you're one of those rare individuals who belongs to the breed of *collaborative writers*. Who instinctively knows how much and how detailed to write in each scene. How to use \"show not tell\" in the most optimal way. Who can deliver all the true personalities and those raw emotions of adult men, not boys. Challenged by sometimes extreme circumstances and forced to show their vulnerable side.\n\nLet's mix all the clich\u00e9 with the most unique we can think of and write stories that people would pay to see in the movies!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Yes Please**\n\n\u2714     thrilling yet realistic action with heartbreaking, well dosed drama as well as intense but organic MxM romance\n\n\u2714    creating large casts of  tangible, multi dimensional characters and rediscovering them in new settings/verses\n\n\u2714    main characters that are (or at least appear/aspire to be) physically and mentally capable and confident manly guys, acting accordingly to their age and life experience; men who in life and romance naturally fall into equal x equal dynamics\n\n\u2714    decent size posts with length adjusted to what scene calls for; rich in detail and giving insight into character's mind\n\n\u2714    exploring various themes and genres with the right combo of character development, exciting plot and some world building, while leaning towards modern/realistic vibe\n\n\u2714    open, sincere communication with a long-term partner and frequent OOC chatter to keep the spark alive!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Not Interested In**\n\n\u2718    situations/characters that don't feel believable; realism is important even in \"unreal\" verses\n\n\u2718    not well fleshed out personalities or making characters act OOC\n\n\u2718    weak/needy/feminine appearing males as main characters, predetermined caregiver x cared-for dynamics and anything that might seem  \"too immature\" or \"too angsty\"\n\n\u2718    overusing dark/heavy themes (like suicide, health issues, addictions) by making them become one of the main traits of a character/story\n\n\u2718    letting rper's mood or knowledge affect their post\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Compatibility Check \u32e1**\n\nHow are we doing so far? Do you feel like we're seeking and offering similar things? Let me touch on few spots we might vary at, to help you figure that out!\n\nI don't look for a partner for a single rp or single genre/theme. I'd like us to share general interests and enjoy writing multiple stories, eventually adjusted to our \"current cravings\". And even though I don't mind making new, additional characters each time, I'd like us to grow to love some \"core group\" of them. That we can rediscover in AUs/alternative paths etc.\n\nThat's why it's so important for me to not only use NPCs and typical side characters to \"fill the world\" our mains live in, but to create at least few main characters. Or at least a good number of decently developed \"sides\" who could turn into mains one day.\n\nIf you're game for such a long lasting rp-bromance, please note that even though I very much enjoy unreal verses or some fantasy/sci fi elements in my rps, I am leaning towards  \"nowadays reality\". Advanced tech? Apocalyptic world? Urban fantasy or futuristic elements? Maybe even deep space, historical or high fantasy world? All that could be my thing, but my go-to is modern/realistic mix of action+romance+drama.\n\nOne last thing. But in a way most important one. *Characters*. At the end of the day, whatever the verse we explore and whatever the plot we develop... the fictional, yet in our minds not any less *living and breathing* humans who experience all the hardship and happiness our brains produce, are the most important part of the story. And for me to enjoy ours? All main characters have to give that vibe of a physically and mentally realistic, masculine, mature man. I will happily elaborate on this one!\n\n**Still on board? Awesome! I hope by now you can tell that I'd like to meet people who will not just \"try to meet my requirements\". I hope they will simply** ***share*** **similar preferences. So they can enjoy my writing as much as I hope to enjoy theirs. If you think we have potential? Go ahead and PM me, share what you think we have in common or if that's easier, just list the things we vary at. Hope to hear from you soon!**",

I would prefer over discord. If you\u2019re interested dm me for my discord and I hope you enjoy your day.",

            "selftext": "I'm juggling with this idea for a couple of days now and I finally decided to write it down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo how you probably could already tell from the title this will be a BNHA like RP but honestly we dont have to use any of the characters from BNHA I am only interested in the Universe. All people have quirks there are Heros paid by the goverment you know what I mean if you watched the Anime/Read the Manga.\n\nI have 1 scenario in mind:\n\n**Setting:** The Setting will be just like BNHA, a hero school (Maybe with dorms maybe not let's). It dosent matter which hero school it is. It can be any Hero school there is I literally dont care, we can do UA or we can do a Random hero school in a random country it really dosent matter. \n\n**Your character:** The only critera I have for your character is that shes female else you have the biggest creative freedom there is. Personality, Quirk, looks, backstory - really everything is up to you I dont want to restrict you at all. \n\n**My Character:** My character will be male and quirkless. He got diagnosed as a kid and since then was always the loser and outsider but that didnt kept him down. He started training as a very young child and since then didnt stop, every day he trains till he cant move anymore so he can keep up with the naturally gifted people so he can persu his dream of being a hero of showing everyone that he is also strong that someone like him a quirkless boy can also achive what someone with a quirk can.\n\nIt would be long term possibly even after the school already ended and stuff. I also want it to be action packed, funny and stuff, also romance should play a roll but maybe later. I would take over multiple characters if needed thats no problem for me and if you're not comfortable with playing multiple characters thats fine you dont have to we find our way around\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe RP would be either on Discord, Kik or Telegram (I let you choose). Just write me a DM or a comment on this post and I DM you and we can discuss everything further \\^\\^",

            "selftext": "Howdy all! \n\nI'm a 19 y.o. female looking for some new literate partners, and by literate, I mean folks who use proper grammar and punctuation. Spelling mistakes are fine, but I'd like to see some effort in posts. Anyhow, I've had an itch to do a patron and warlock roleplay, where either one of us takes on the role of a higher being and the other is bound by a pact. The terms of this pact are up to us to discuss. However, I've taken the time to write out some potential plot hooks!\n\n**A second chance**: You didn't realize death would come so soon. Mayhaps you'd been amidst a fight when a stray blade wedged itself deep within your chest, or a magical experiment had gone wrong. Either way, you were alive one moment, and not the next. Around you was nothing but black abyss, cold against your skin. Then, a path illuminated itself, and seated upon a red throne was a woman dressed in flowing garb and piercing blue eyes, staring straight down at you.\n\n**Forfeit life**: Since you were a child, there had always been a presence with you. A woman with glowing yellow eyes, dark horns curled around shaggy brown hair - she was always watching, following when you'd invite her to play. But as you grew, you were told you were too old for imaginary friends, and learned to ignore your shadow. However one day, your body seized up, unable to move, and out stepped the woman from the shadows. For the first time in all your years, she spoke to you. \"It's time.\"\n\n**Ritual summoning**: You had become desperate, or you needed more power. You needed something that was out of your grasp, so you tried your hand at the dark arts. You cut your palm, squeezing blood out onto the dank stone, and as your blood hit the center of the ritual circle you'd drawn out, the torches mounted upon the walls blew out. You were left alone in the darkness, when arms suddenly wrapped around your waist, and a voice whispered gentle in your ear. \"Tell me what you need, dear.\"\n\nOf course these are only guidelines, so if we'd like to, we could do something entirely different! I love romance, so I'd love for them to slowly genuinely care for one another. In each iteration, I would have the patron travel alongside her warlock, whether in a different form or her usual. I also only do FxF romance, but your real life gender doesn't matter to me. \n\nSomething to also note, I'm quite busy so there's usually a 2-3 days wait between replies, and if it goes longer than that, I'd let you know. I am maintaining both school and work, so free time is scarce and I'd rather not give rushed replies.\n\nAnyhow, if this piques your interest, send me a PM with your name, Discord and whether you'd like to explore one of these hooks or had something else in mind!",

I live in the EST time zone and I\u2019m currently looking for some long term partners for some plots I\u2019m craving.  I\u2019m semi-literate so I expect my partner to be able to reply with 1-2 paragraph responses as well. I can post at LEAST twice a day, often times more. I use discord only- sorry! \n\nOnto the fun stuff! \n\n\u2022 BOXING COACH: Your character was once a boxing champion, revered in the sport for their glory and amazing fighting skills. However, due to an injury, they were forced into early retirement. My character comes along and has some pro potential, and reluctantly, your character agrees to take her on. A romance develops between the two, and we can take it from there. \n\n\u2022 HOGWARTS: This one is a lot more vague, simply because there\u2019s so many routes to take with it. I\u2019m thinking that our characters are from different houses, yet they somehow get wrapped up into some intense mystery together in the Harry Potter universe! \n\n\u2022 THE WALKING DEAD: This is more of an intense craving that I have. I would really, really, REALLY love to find a Negan to bounce off of one of my characters, or a character who\u2019s domineering yet has that sweet spot like Negan does. Details of this plot can be discussed as well. My character would be from a small compound on a farm, in which Negan/Your OC would come in and take over. This is more of an intense, slow-burn type of romance. \n\nI hope that someone sees this and is interested. If so, hit me up and let\u2019s chat!",

While I haven't roleplayed in about three months I can accommodate any type of roleplayer. Preferably, write enough to convey body language, tone of voice. You don't have to paint every color in the room, but a little bit of scenery is appreciated. With that being said I prefer smaller story-driven groups. I'd like it if we could trade off the responsibility of writing stories within the setting as I often find myself the sole storyteller. That being said I'm welcome to do anything from building a menagerie of monsters, writing about a setting's politics, mapping out geography, defining a magic system, or developing cool space ships. As for settings I enjoy copious amounts of escapism, bland reality can work but I often find it plain. Moral ambiguity and difficult choices are wonderful ways to further liven a setting. I enjoy having to play a character that has an ideology or moral values that are different and exotic from everyday life. I primarily use discord so contact me with your information if you're interested.",

            "selftext": "Hello there! Back again looking for some more quality RP partners. This time around I'm doing something a bit different, but familiar. I say this because I've done two similar stories with the general idea of superpowers, although they had some differences in terms of characters, their age and some other lore details. Before we get to the plot summary, I should mention that this story can and will have dark themes. It is not meant for the faint-hearted. I should also mention that while this summary will seem basic, there are MANY layers underneath that are going to make for some intense storytelling that I hope my partners will enjoy. I also expect my partner to be just as creative or inspired to create an amazing roleplay, but we'll get to that soon.  \n\n\nThe general story outline is as follows:  \nTaking place in New York City (Manhattan), 2019 (although technology is slightly more advanced), two teenage children--a brother and a sister--are among the few rarities of the world. They are humans born with a power of some sort. These humans are so rare that most of the population aren't aware of their existence. The U.S. government makes an effort of finding these powered people and 'taking' them for experimentation, although they normally have no way of searching for powered people. Police reports are typically the way these powered people are discovered--and those that are 'taken' by the government are never seen again.  \n\n\nIt's the first day of sophomore year in high school for the brother. Him and his delinquent friend are heading to high school one morning. Their lives will change in more ways than they can count after meeting your character--another powered person.  \n\n\nWill it be for better--or for worse?  \n==========================================================================  \nThat's the super duper basic outline of the plot! Now let's get to what I'm looking for in a partner/some notes:\n\n* 18+ in age! Like I said earlier, this story will have some dark themes. I'm not opposed to some slice of life moments, however, expect this story to be geared towards progression because oh boy it's gonna be a long one.\n* Which brings me to this point. Be prepared for a long term RP!\n* Decent reply rate. Three to four replies per day, minimum. I understand that sometimes people can get busy and I totally get that. Tell me if this is the case for a few days and I'll be patient--however I do wish to move the story along. If you're somebody that can get in a ton of replies in a day, you're awesome!\n* Literate. I want to understand what you're saying and that's all I ask for. You don't have to know a lot of big words but you have to know how to write properly.\n* Speaking of literacy, I'm looking for partners that can match my lengthier replies! They aren't too horribly big but when I write a response that's multiple paragraphs and I only receive one in return, that's really bleh. Two paragraphs minimum, and try to shoot for more if possible. Fast paced combat/back and forth chatter calls for short responses so I'm okay with that!\n* Friendly OOC is cool too :)\n* Passion! I love a partner that becomes just as invested into the RP as I do. I find if my partner is excited about the RP that they tend to put in more effort.\n* I expect you to world build with me, at least a little bit! \n* Work with me when you're creating your power. It's kind of a spoiler, but I need to know that your power isn't too crazy. No reality warping powers--for example--stopping time. Anything along those lines is a no-no. Don't be afraid to have an interesting or strong power, though!  \n\n\nOkay that's all I can think of for now. If I think of anything else I'll bring it up. If you're interested, shoot me a DM and we'll discuss a few things before heading on over to Discord. Thanks for reading! =)",

Someone who can also play mainly canon characters is also very important. While I'm okay with OC's, please keep in mind I'm mainly looking to do RPs with canon characters. Someone who is willing to talk, communicate and discuss ideas. Communication is key in these kinds of partnerships -- I don't tolerate ghosting and if either of us have a problem with one another or the RP, let's talk before you decide to block me and not say another word. I'm willing to talk it out if you are too, and I think we can all agree we hate being ghosted and have been ghosted multiple times by different people quite often. Just how it is. Someone 18+ would be great, because I like to explore NSFW themes like violence and smut. Someone as into action/violence, and romance/smut would be great as well! If this is sounding like you, or you think we may be compatible, please continue reading below for the RPs I'm looking for!  \n\n\nFandom:  \n\n\n\\*\\*\\* = Ones I really want to do. \n\n*Anime:* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Watamote.

I have many ideas for just about all of the fandoms listed. Hope to hear from someone!",

That means I am very busy: there will be days when my brain will be fried and served with pickles.\n\nIf you add my frequent pauses and bouts of grief to the above, you will see why I'm looking for those who understand that I am not able to deliver novella type posts. For me, a writer can describe feelings and actions in a few words, and this is what I seek right now. Meaningful but laid back realism, having fun, being able to relax. Also looking for a lot of OOC discussion about the story itself.\n\nPlease be at least over 18, because mature themes will surely arise: not as a form of compulsion, but as an organic part of the story.\n\n**Adult women are what I am looking to play at the moment, in MxF relationships.** Romance and Drama are vital for me, as moving, evolving character studies of some sort. I am not interested in Anime or Furry, sorry about that.\n\n**I have been having major issues with my inspiration lately, so you can hit me up with things you love and we can see if we could come to an agreement. I'm looking to follow, not lead, if possible.**  \n\n\nLooking to fill one open spot!\n\n  \n**Having filled most of my other cravings, this is a very specific request to write against** ***Tony Stark*** **or** ***T'Challa*** **in an MCU setting.

            "selftext": "A thin haze of smoke floated lazily around the room lending the pub a slightly ethereal feel, like an ancient woodland cloaked in mist. The low rumble of the patrons' voices blending together, too low to make out any actual words, and adding another layer to the muted music in the background. The barkeeper, a portly man with thinning hair and an easy smile, wiped at a spill of foam and beer that marked the well cared for slab of oak that served as the bar top.\n\nThe patrons were as many and varied as the lives they lived and the jobs they worked. However they were all drawn to The Hanging Man by their one similarity. In a booth a great hairy man with cunning, yellow eyes and a wolfs shadow grinned a predatory smile and laughed with a beautiful Greek woman whose hair twitched and writhed as though it was alive; A collection of small, hairy men clustered at one end of the bar as two of them gesticulated wildly amid much laughter and drinking; a young woman in a nurses uniform looked out over the rim of her pint with ancient eyes; Around a table a man with a greenish complexion and leaves in his hair and beard peered out from under his hood as a grey haired man with a wide brimmed blue hat and an eye-patch over one of his eyes spoke to an Indian woman with faintly blue skin, fire in her eyes, blood red lips and a necklace strung with beads carved to look like human heads.\n\nThe heavy oak door squeaked as it opened, announcing the newcomer before the bell that hung above the entrance.\n\n******\n\nI'm looking for some sort of urban fantasy setting, sort of American Gods or Fables style. If you have any questions, or ideas give me a shout, I look forwards to hearing from you :D",

            "selftext": "Hello, everyone!\n\nI\u2019ve been wanting to do a romantic RP centered around a teen idol and one of his fans.\n\nThe plot would be as follows: I\u2019m a huge fan and I always fantasized about you being my boyfriend, just like any girl does with their idols. The main issue is that, for all intents and purposes, you\u2019re straight: the media is always spreading rumors about you and a random celebrity; there\u2019s always a picture of you on a date with a girl; lots of flirting on twitter.\n\nThat makes me sad and upset, but I can\u2019t help keeping my fantasy. We\u2019re the same age and it could totally happen! Except for that tiny detail and the fact that there\u2019s no way on Earth we\u2019d ever meet... until I win a scholarship to attend the same school as you!\n\nIf that scenario interests you, I\u2019d be happy to talk about it. Some things:\n\n- I usually roleplay in 1st person but I\u2019m okay with 3rd as long as you\u2019re patient enough to overlook some occasional slips.\n\n- Response length isn\u2019t an issue as long as it makes sense within the context. I see no reason to force the writing of a long paragraph when we\u2019re in the middle of a dialogue scene that begs for back and forth; I also dislike lazy one sentence replies when a description is in order. Basically, all I ask is for coherence.\n\n- Proper English and punctuation is a must.\n\n- I like writing character bios and using reference pictures. \n\n- I can use Discord or Kik.\n\nThanks for reading all this!",

            "selftext": "Hi there! I\u2019m 21 and been writing for about 7-8 years. I\u2019m looking for someone to be able to talk with ic and ooc to create a nice dynamic that can blend into our writing chemistry. I understand that real life always comes first and I will never be one to force replies. As for plots have a couple of ideas so if one interests you or you want to put a fun spin on it please message me and we can plot!\n\nNow for the fun part, plot ideas!!\n\nPersephone and Hades-\nCan either be the classic Greek mythology or a new telling of it, but the characters have such a beautiful and bold dynamic and I would love to try writing something off that base.\n\nGhost in the house-\nOne muse just bought a new home only to find out it\u2019s haunted. At first the ghost just tends to watch over the other and maybe even begins to play a couple pranks on their new home owner. The longer they watch over them, they begin to fall a bit for the other even though they are living. At the same time the new home owner found old letters from the old owner and begins learning more about them. Slowly they both become very aware of the others presence. \n\nHomecoming-\nThe two muses were best friends growing up and eventually started dating. It wasn\u2019t until the end of senior year that they decided to part ways, but not on the best terms. Almost a decade later, she came home for a couple weeks before she\u2019s due to marry someone else but the two begin to fall back in love. (I know it\u2019s a cliche but I can\u2019t help but love it) \n\nThose are just a couple quick plots and ideas and I would be happy to look into others or edit the ideas. I\u2019m okay if any of them become or develops into something NSFW. I personally write in 3rd person and typically in paragraphs. But if you are interested please shoot me a message I would love to talk!",

It'll mostly be a mix between light drama and adorable romance, my two absolute favorite things. I'll leave my starter here!))\n\nYou and Ollie have been dating for quite a while now. He's been more distant in the relationship, but Its hard to exactly blame him. He was terrified of his family knowing, knowing about you. They would surely kick him out of they knew he was gay, or simply tear him away from you. He would refrain from affection, sweet talk, in fear of them knowing. \n\nBut in those rare moments you two were safe, he would look at you with such longing, such love that you knew it would be worth waiting. He'd caress you, appreciate your body and soul like the work of art it is. It was even more painful he had to hide this side of himself so often, when all he wanted was you. \n\nIn the past few days, he's been extra careful. His parents had begun to suspect. Suspect that you two are more than only friends. You can see the fear in his eyes when they look at him, when his brother observes you two oh so carefully when you're together. \n\nBut he made a mistake. The mistake of kissing you goodbye, as his brother watched, ready to out him. That would surely mean a swift beating followed by eviction from his room. \n\nThat landed Ollie at your front door. Forming bruises littering the side of his face, tired looking, teary eyed. He has no other place to go. And he needs your comfort, to be here with you, the man he loves the most.",

            "selftext": " Hiya.\n\nAs that blurb above, my main interest is in someone who holds to the same aesthetic and technical detail as I myself do, whether that be in use of prose and grammar or more relating to the world and the nations within it. To clarify, I enjoy a particular amount of detail when it comes to a universe: with the strong distaste I have for dry as marrow 'Dungeons and Dragons' worlds, I much rather prefer that the worlds be living and breathing things with the nations caked in history and culture and vibrant personalities that exist to give it blood and feel like an actual civilization that could exist realistically. They aren't just their self-contained little identities either: each identity and society would have evolved together and thus have drastically influenced each other's development, developing hatreds and sibling-like bonds between each other where, regardless of which, the necessity of (not exactly) state takes priority and ultimately all are looking out for themselves. Preferably, this would all take place within the scope of medieval favormongering politics: eight-hundreds to, at most, the fifteenth century in terms of technology. To be clear - I don't do AUs. Don't present me with your alternate history worlds that are edits to our own reality. I only do fantasy worlds, no alternative Earth material.\n\nFantastical races and supernatural/magical elements are a-okay with me as far as I'm concerned as, in my opinion, they give a chance for the world to put a spin on more conventional and realistic cultures and methods of administration by introducing non-human psychologies and biologies, making something alien and foreign for the MC to interact with (as well as other nations present.) This is, theoretically, including Tolkien-esq races such as dwarves, elves, orcs, all that, but, forewarning, that I have little to no respect for people who essentially just rebrand Tolkien's themes and ideas for races and paste them into their own, disrespecting him by so poorly conveying his meaning, and themselves for being a lighthearted plagiarist.\n\nQuite alright with the nitty and gritty. I dig a morbid universe that's dark and dreary and depressing as that essentially is the entire existence of the vast majority of the human population up until the industrial revolution which is a distance concept from now.\n\nWhere we write is of little consequence to me, but I do have a fondness for OC chatter on Discord, but it's not a requirement whatsoever. I personally discourage writing on Discord for the very obvious reasons of a text limit and it generally just being clunky with its formatting, but will acquiesce if requested.\n\nI play a number of OCs, many of which aren't women and all with their own diverse interests and opinions on things: bear in mind that I will choose a character that molds and fits into the world, not the other way around. I highly suggest not opening me with the question, 'Tell me about your character' before I know anything about the world and the content within it. I won't know until you share about yourself and the stories you're good at weaving and what the world you have to offer will, itself, have to offer.\n\nThat's about the length of it. Cheers, darlings.",

My name's AJ and I'm a 25-year-old woman, and though I do play my fair share of male characters, the plots in this post will involve me playing a female main character. I'm looking for anyone that can play a male character for one of these plots, the other (where gender isn't mentioned) is up to the player.  \n\n\n1. Two thieves posing as staff for a high-end party are in for a rude awakening when they realize that the hosts, as well as the guests, are a part of an active community of homicidal degenerates.   \n\n2.  A crass chav and an uptight secretary make for an odd couple, but they have managed to form a strictly no strings attached arrangement despite the latter insisting that she despises him. After spending the night at his place, she attempts to discreetly sneak out only to find a zombie outbreak has begun while the two were asleep. *(Obviously gunning for something similar to Shaun of the Dead here lol)*  \n\n\nI'd consider myself an okay-ish writer, as in I'm capable of stringing words together into something intelligible at least. Pretty unpolished, tbh. I'd be fine with providing some writing samples if needed and no hard feelings if you don't think our writing styles will mesh. If you've got another idea in mind that's similar to either of these, please keep in mind that I'm heavy into character-driven stuff.",

            "selftext": "Hiya! So I've got an idea I would love to try out for Lucifer, whether you want to be the fox version, the supernatural version, or even your own version of Lucifer! Basically the idea is that my characters father made a deal with the devil about a decade ago but refused to give up his own soul, instead offering his daughter's (my character) hand in marriage. The roleplay would take place ten years later on her twenty first birthday, when Lucifer comes to collect her. I have a starter for this. It is meant to be romantic, filled with drama and tension, action, magic, whole nine yards. MAY include NSFW should the plot lead to it, but will not be the focus of the story. If you are not 18+ it will be a strict fade to black only. Dm me for my discord!",

            "selftext": "Padris used to be a realm full of magic, wonders and beautiful mythical creatures. But now, it has been taken over by a seemingly unstoppable force of corruption, turning most of the living creatures on its lands into bloodthirsty beasts and has made survival nearly impossible. Every island on Padris is hostile, and the only way to combat against these dark forces is magic. Although, the magic users of Padris have been diminishing, and the sorcerers left couldn't possibly lead the fight on their own.\n\nWhich is why these remaining wizards founded Padrites- a prestigious magic school that teaches every sort of branch of the Padris magic arts. The school's goals are to train aspiring wizards to become powerful sorcerers, who will join the fight against the corruption upon graduation, and also preserve the magic of their realm. Because there are only a few in Padris who can preform the magical arts, they must find others who have magical capabilities elsewhere. Using dimensional magic, they have been able to come into contact with other worlds, which may have the students they are looking for. The staff now searches all sorts of different realms for students who have extraordinary magical capabilities, and would send invitations in the form of a golden scroll to anyone who is worthy.\n\nAnd you have been invited.\n\n====================\n\nIf you would like a unique magic school roleplay experience, then this server is for you!\n\nPadrites features:\n\n\\-Parties\n\n\\-Possibilities for any type of character\n\n\\-Familiars\n\n\\-Quests of all sorts\n\n\\-Events\n\n\\-Competition between parties\n\n\\-A friendly community\n\n\\-A developed universe/school\n\n\\-Many secrets to unravel\n\n\\-And a ton more!\n\nCome join us!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://discord.gg/SDGRHrw](https://discord.gg/SDGRHrw)",

            "selftext": "Hi, my name is Courtney, and I am looking for STORY BASED partners to roleplay with, preferably male.\n\nSo what am I looking for? Some one who...\n\n -18+ only please\n\n-is comfortable writing in paragraph form\n\n-Can write a post that is 2 paragraphs on average. I understand, however, writers block happens, or certain scenes do not call for 2 entire paragraphs. I usually write between 2-5 paragraphs. To be honest, I can post up to 850 words, sometimes more. But don't be intimidated! I am not stuck on counting your words.  I just want a great partner to write with!!!!!!\n\n-Puts effort into their grammar. I make all kinds of mistakes when my fingers get to flying, but I try to proofread. (At least in the roleplay. In OOC I make all sorts of errors being chatty)\n\n-Can make time to roleplay back and forth. I will allow a couple days between posts, but honestly, I want some one to escape into a new world with for a time.\n\n\nGotham City (my favorite idea)\n\nIdea-- Batman: I can use a Russian girl or a Japanese female for this story, which ever is asthetically pleasing to you. I will tell the idea as the Japanese female, but I can interchange the things necessary. Harumi Hikari was 16 when her parents were brutally murdered before her eyes. She never knew her father was a high ranking member of Yakkuza. That fateful day, she was taken after watching them die at the hands of a rival gangster, trying to work his way up the food chain. During those years, she learned her captor's habits, and discovered where he kept money and other things. At age 19, she escaped, stealing only what she needed from her captor in order to survive. She became a legal US citizen after arriving on ship at Gotham Harbor. She was hungry, weak, and tired. It was now her time to search for work. She got an apartment on the crummy side of town, paying for 6 months of rent up front. She then spent what she had left on clothing and makeup for interviews and a job, and the very little that was left bought her a small amount of food. She needed to find work quickly. She spent days searching, but so many were leary of hiring a woman with no work history and she was not in a place emotionally to explain the gap in employment. So, Lucious Fox does a preliminary interview. He finds that the girl does not have much experience, but has a lot of drive to succeed, she would work for every penny. He pushed her through for a second interview with Bruce Wayne, where we would open our story.\n\nThere are many places this story could lead. We can introduce many of the people of Gotham.....poison ivy....joker.....anyone. I love creativity and improv. The big part is that at some point her captor will come searching....and find her. (Cue ominous music...jkjk) Like I said though, this story can branch out into so many things. As far as the Bruce Wayne I am seeking...I am not looking for Adam West. I am looking for dark, gritty, deep controlled rage, more in the vein of the comics or Christian Bale.\nI want a partner who can help me make the city of Gotham 3 dimensional.\n\nPlease be able to rp in 3rd person, be detailed. Usually my posts range between 1 and 5 paragraphs. They are often closer to 3-5. Be willing to get into the deeper parts of Bruce, the things that make him tick always intrigue me.\n\nOkay that's all. PM me if you are ready to jump into Gotham City.",

I've been roleplaying for over 15 years  in various formats, from forums and chats to tabletop and larp - this  does however mean that as I am older (early 30\u2019s), I\u2019m not comfortable  writing with folk under 18 (21 and older is preferred).\n\nStylistically,  I write in third person past tense and my post lengths vary from 3  paragraphs up to about 9 depending on what\u2019s needed for the scene (I  will never push for a partner to  match, just give me enough to work  with :D ). The frequency of my replies may also vary as I do work full  time and have other hobbies, but I aim to reply every other day at  least. If my schedule gets hectic I try to shoot my partners a quick   email just to let them know that there\u2019ll be a delay - I appreciate it   if my RP partner's do the same :)\n\nOne  thing I do ask from my RP partner is not to ghost; communication is  key, and if you\u2019re not enjoying the thread, or you need some time for  real life stuff then I will understand. Just *please* let me know, and if we can work something out then thats great, if not then we can part on good terms :)\n\nAs  for the rest of my RP preferences, I\u2019m pretty chill about it; I enjoy  most genres from adventure to fantasy, angst to romance\u2026.or a mix of  all! As for limitations, mine are fairly standard - feel free to discuss  with me any particular topics or triggers you wish to avoid in the RP.\n\n**Fandoms I'm always looking for and** ***italics*** **being my preferred character**\n\n**Harry Potter - Marauders Era**\n\n*Remus* /Sirius (wolfstar)\n\nGeneral non romance (if good plot)\n\n**Xmen / The Gifted**\n\n*Charles* / Erik (cherik)\n\n*Rogue* x Gambit (Romy)\n\n*Lorna*/Marcus\n\nGeneral non romance (if good plot)\n\n**The Adventure Zone**\n\n*Lup* x Barry (blupjeans)\n\nBalance General non romance\n\n**Other fandoms I could be interested in if there's a good plot....**\n\n**Assassin's Creed**\n\nEzio/*Leo*\n\n**Throne Of Glass**\n\nGeneral non romance or general romance - no preferred characters as of yet (im only on book 3)\n\nIf  any of these take your fancy,\u00a0or if we\u2019ve rp\u2019d before and lost touch,  I\u2019d still love to hear from you - whether it\u2019s to continue our old  threads, start new ones or even just a catch up! Feel free to DM me and  we can chat/plot! :D",

I really like Richard Carlisle's character: he knows what he wants, he knows how to get it, and most importantly, he is doing everything to get it. Mary is a lot like him, only that of course being the protagonist she stuck to being the romanticist after all.  I want to RP where Richard and Mary actually get married and go forward into the changes brought about by the early 1900s.\n\nDM me if you're interested and I'll discuss everything including RP arrangements in detail on discord. I hope to find someone over 25 as I've always worked well with the older ones. Thank you!",

They all exist, though hidden by the sheer ignorance of the Humans, or rather the inability to believe.  Only these creatures aren't like the stories you've read. No longer violent or living like cave dwellers, no. These mythical beings could be your neighbor or even your spouse. \n\n\n100 years ago when america was in its infancy and the world's population was quickly growing, monsters decided that living in the shadows as a savage race was no longer an option so The Order of Black Hill was formed. Representatives from each non human species had an equal voice. And those few hunter/human tribes were approached. An uneasy deal was reached, each mythical creature would behave and the Humans could act as law enforcers. Now in modern day, that alliance still exists, and the human policing force is known as The Shadow. \n\nHi I'm A. At least that's what you can call me. I'm looking for a mxf dynamic here. I'll of course tell you more in pms.  I have a discord and a kik but I'm glad to rp here. I'm 22years old and prefer that my partner is At least 18.",

            "selftext": "Good Morning all!\n\nRecently I've gotten the itch back to do some Overwatch roleplays. I'm going to be looking for a few partners, possibly 2-4. I am looking for people who are literate (2 paragraphs per reply minimum), write in third-person and include plenty of detail in their writing. If this describes you, perfect! Keep reading!\n\nI am not interested in simple plots. I am looking for creative ideas and possibly creative pairings. Our RP is welcome to take place in alternative Universes and/or be written in genres other and the given Overwatch Universe, and truthfully it's preferred. High Fantasy, Gang, 18+, Mystery, they're all welcome, although I'd like to have a centering theme of romance. The characters in our story should *not* already be involved with eachother, as a majority of the plot should be how they meet and fall for eachother. I am also not interested in doing any other Fandoms. Mostly because I don't know any. I'd like to create something original. \n\nFor my comfort, interest and best work, I can only play as Mercy or D.Va (heavily preferring Mercy, although.) Here are the pairings I'm open to;\n\nMercy X Genji (bring your spoopy ideas... my fave Halloween couple \ud83d\udc95), \nMercy X McCree, \nMercy X Hanzo, \nMercy X Reaper, \nMercy X Widowmaker, \nMercy X Sombra, \nMercy X Ashe || \n\nD.Va X D.Mon, \nD.Va X Genji, \nD.Va X Kyungsoo, \nD.Va X Daehyun, \nD.Va X Widowmaker, \nD.Va X McCree, \nD.Va X Reaper\n\nIf you're interested in creating a unique and creative plot involving these characters, are open to communication, reworks (and okay with occasional disappearances which I can explain in pm lol) go ahead and direct message me.\n\nCan't wait to hear from you!!\n\nedit: I somehow can't make my pairings list pretty.... rip so ignore now ugly it is",

            "selftext": "Hello all! I recently have a craving to do a roleplay based off monster musume loosely and the premise goes as follows: \n\nYou are a big town, average everyday Joe working in the lower end of the field you want to be in and you are just starting to get your life on track when the government announces the monster exchange program and you decided the benefits of gaining money from the government to keep a monster girl in your house seems worth it, after all they are just going to study and keep to themselves right? Not like you will ever develop feelings for one!\n\nThe story will follow you and I as a new exchange monster with a tough background and baggage coming from home. It will take you developing a lot of understanding and difficult times to help get me accustomed to the human way of life, maybe feelings develop along the way and of course I wont be the only monster you get to help with the bills. Causing new problems but solving old ones. This roleplay is going to be a slow burn romance there will be bumps in the road, maybe we dont perfectly click at first but over time it happens. Now, onto basic requirements/rules.\n\n1.) Be 18+ in case of any NSFW content later on. (No exceptions here)\n\n2.) 1st person, present tense, paragraph style for our characters since this is how I am accustomed to doing it. I would need that in return.\n\n3.) I go by PST time but I do tend to stay up late so that shouldnt be a problem just fyi\n\n4.) Be invested and care about the world! I want the rp to be fun and interesting for both of us.\n\n5.) Be pretty responsive. Multiple replies a day is a must unless obviously you will busy one day or something. Communication is key here. If you go silent with no explanation for over two days I will remove you and assume you ghosted so please keep that in mind. I put effort into my rps and I would appriciate the courtesy to not waste either of our times or efforts. \n\n6.) No one liners, I dont expect perfect grammar but I should be able to understand it without struggling and you need to add something to the story with each reply. I dont have a specific minimum limit on words as long as they add and move on the story. \n\nI think that's all, if you are interested or have questions, please feel free to ask! I look forward to hearing from you all!",
