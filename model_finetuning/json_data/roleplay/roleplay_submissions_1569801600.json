            "selftext": "Good Evening, everyone! As far would have it, I've been playing a handful of post apocalyptic games lately, and it goes without saying that they've got me itching to make an apocalyptic world of my own to play around in. I come to you all seeking someone that would like to take part in it as well, as one of the few remaining citizens of whatever has been left behind by some doomsday event or another!\n\nThat being said, I'm not in love with any one particular kind of world or the events that's would take place within it. It could be anything from something sudden and traumatic (say, a nuclear strike or natural disasters) or something more slow and meticulous (like a sickness, infection, etc!) As each of them offer any number of delicious opportunities and perils that our characters would have to brave against in order to survive. I've got something of a plot outline for most of them, but I'd also love to hear your own thoughts and ideas so that we might make a story that the both of us would really enjoy! \n\nAs for any \"fluff,\" if you will, I'm more than willing to accept the presence of violence and smut in my roleplay, but not without warrant or to the extent that it waters down the story itself. I get it, in a post apocalyptic world where there's no rules and few repercussions, there's likely to be a lot of violence.. but I'd still like there to be enough room for the other story elements that we crave.\n\nWhat I'm looking for in my partner is fairly simple! I only ask that you be fairly understanding of time restrictions, as I will be as well, and that you be at least mostly literate! Of course, I'm not stranger to typos and auto-corrects, so I promise that I won't hound you on any mistakes that might come up. \n\nIf you'd prefer, I also have a small handful of platforms on which we can move this to if it takes off, but I please ask that you reach out to me through Reddit messages! \n\nI hope to hear from some of you! Have a good one!",

I do warn you that in both of them, my characters have terrible backstories. I feel like this wont attract a lot of people because it isn't anything like, you know, hot. It's more mature than some plots here. There are heavy fantasy elements in the one, and the other hardly classifies as slice of life. So if you're looking for a good, dramatic ride and wouldn't mind a little guidance from me on who to play, please consider messaging me!

As for what I\u2019m looking for, I\u2019m not clear on what I\u2019m looking for plot-wise, but I can tell you this: \n\nI love romance, and it\u2019s a definite must, whether it\u2019s FxF or MxF, and I always play female. I\u2019m into drama, action, dark themes, supernatural, slice of life, horror, adventure, and pretty much all of the above. My imagination has troubles when it comes to fantasy and magic, though. \n\nI\u2019m pretty much willing to do any genre or plots that you may have, and if neither of us have a fleshed out idea it\u2019s always fun to create one together and continue creating together as we go along! \n\nLet me also mention this: I\u2019m not looking for a sex-based roleplay, but enjoy including it into the story as it fits, with an appropriate build. \n\nMy preference for style is 1st person, but I can do 3rd as well. I don\u2019t care about post length, and think a paragraph is just fine. I cannot find 2+ paragraphs fun, as I feel like it hinders the partners\u2019 abilities to move the story along. Although, when starting a new roleplay I can definitely see where length is necessary. It\u2019s just easier to bounce off of replies when they\u2019re shorter, especially with dialogue. \n\nIf you have any prompts, plots, or ideas you\u2019d like to discuss or roleplay, send me a message so we can get to creating something together. I hope you took time to read this, I tried to keep it short, so if you have any further comments/questions, message me! Thanks, Bailey.",

We're a small, tight-knit community, but after eight years of essentially staying within our group and only adding one or two new people, we've decided to branch out. Fully cognizant of the difficulty of breaking into a new, established setting, we've made a Wiki for your convenience, and will run any newcomers through a quick quest with a character of their own devising (we're happy to help if you would like it!) so that they can see if they enjoy the style of roleplay.\n\nThe world is heavily inspired by Dungeons &amp; Dragons and Warhammer Fantasy, but after eight years of constant development and updates, we've certainly built our own world, with a very distinct feel unmatched by any other setting I've ever seen.\n\nEven if you're new to the hobby, I recommend giving it a shot -- we're happy to help people along, so long as you're willing to put in the effort!\n\nInterested in learning more, reading the wiki, or starting up? Stop on by, even if you just want to ask us some questions. https://discord.gg/4zVrEs",

I have a few characters listed below regarding who I can play as and who I'd like someone to play for me. I do not like including OCs so please do not inquire about including them, the answer is already 'no.' Characters are going to be bumped up so they are 18+ years old. I do have some plots regarding some pairs, some are fairly AU (for instance I have a plot where a canon pro is actually a villain or a student in a double agent working for either the heroes or villains). \n\nGenerally I write over discord but if you prefer on-site, that's fine too. I like to give several healthy sized paragraphs. Sometimes only three are enough, sometimes if we're skipping ahead then I'll write upwards of ten paragraphs. It just depends. Adult situations are okay with me too though I prefer something slow burn with ample development before things happen.\n\nDiscord is what I'd prefer but reddit might work but posts may be slower. \n\nAlso, all pairs as assumed MxF, I can double but I also am fine with just playing female characters.\n\nNow onto the good stuff! These are in order of comfort/caving to least experience/interest. \n\n**Characters I write as:**\n\nOchako\n\nMomo\n\nKyoka\n\nDenki\n\nShoto\n\nTsuyu\n\nAizawa\n\nMelissa Shield\n\nDeku\n\nBakugo\n\nToru\n\n**Characters I want someone to write as:**\n\nAll Might\n\nAizawa\n\nPresent Mic\n\nTenya\n\nMiro\n\nDenki\n\nEijiro\n\nTsuyu\n\nDeku\n\nMomo\n\nMina",

            "selftext": "Hello all! I'm currently in search of a partner *specifically* for a World of Warcraft-themed story. While the actual setting within the timeline, as well as location and theme, is up for debate, it will take place within the canon story. Furthermore, this will also be a DM'd roleplay (I'm more than happy to explain how that works if anyone isn't sure). That being said, I'm hoping for this to be long-term and an opportunity to make a good friend!\n\nHere's what I'm looking for in a partner:\n\n* Experience with serious writing. While I don't have an issue with casual writers, I prefer my stories to have a lot of depth and passion in them, rather than the shallow sort of roleplay you'd find in an MMO.\n* Knowledge of World of Warcraft lore. I'm not an expert myself, but it'll be a little difficult writing in this universe if you don't have a basic understanding of the lore. If you know at least a bit, I'm happy to introduce the lore to you organically!\n* Someone with a flexible posting schedule. I'd love to write all day like I used to, but between work, my fiance, and my hobbies, I'm a busy person. I'll be able to get out at least a few posts a day **minimum**. I'm currently in the process of changing my jobs but I should have significantly more time to post after a few weeks.\n* Post length. While I'm not looking for a novel, anything less than a paragraph will dishearten me. Of course, there are times for short posts (especially if we're doing a lot of responses), but I love it when my partner goes into detail. \n* Quality. Length is important, but quality is more important. I find that when you have one, you can often find the other. I don't mind if english isn't your first language, but I'd love for you to be at least a decent writer!\n\nThat out of the way, I'd like to do one of two scenarios:\n\n* A Warcraft story that takes place during the years of vanilla WoW and slowly progresses to the current date. This would happen through storytelling, adventure, as well as some timelapses and advances to allow the progression of the story. This would allow your character to progress from an inexperienced novice to a Champion of Azeroth! I might even fit in an actual storyline or two from the game if it interested you! (i.e., the assault on Icecrown or the Draenor Invasion)\n\n* The Conclusion of the Fourth War, which is the events of BFA after the fall of the Burning Legion. This would be a story that revolves around the Alliance and War's conflicts within the various isles and the war around azerite.\n\nIf you're interested or have any questions, please don't hesitate to send me a message! I'm specifically only looking for one partner and once I have found that person, I'll take this post down. So, that being said, if it's still up then I'm still searching! \n\n\n*PS* Send me a message with a bit about yourself, please!",

Or maybe they\u2019re a princess/prince? There are many options for this and I am happy to hear all of your ideas! \n\nIn terms of pairings, I can do M x M (my favorite) M x F (with me as F) or F x F. \n\n1. Please be literate! No bad grammar or text talk! Third person only!\n\n2. Please be reasonably active. No ghosting. I realize life gets busy, however if you only reply once in a blue moon, I am not for you. Please communicate if you\u2019ll be away for a long period of time (I will understand and do the same). \n\n3. You must be 18+. I will not roleplay with anyone younger than eighteen , no exceptions. \n\n4. I do not use a set stock of characters. I always make a character specifically to a plot. For roleplaying with me, please do the same. I respect if you have your own already, I\u2019m just not one for inserting one character into every plot. Please be okay with this. \n\nI welcome people of all gender expressions, and also check out my other ads too! Thank you for reading and I hope to hear from you soon! Please feel free to shoot me PM if any of this interested you!",

            "selftext": "It's almost hard to believe that it's been a year(ish) since I last searched for this.\n\nWell. Anyway. With the recent launch of shadowkeep for Destiny 2, I've found myself overwhelmed with a craving to write in the game\u2019s universe. Of course, with completely original characters and storylines, but with plenty of references to established lore. It's practically a font of untapped RP goodness, and I haven't actually managed to get anything quite like I imagine just yet. Which, I suppose, is why I'm writing this post up.\n\nRegardless, I should mention that romance is something that I'll actively be looking for, as that's an element that I enjoy mixing into things. Who doesn't like a bit of tension added to normal, everyday lives of guardians? Well, as normal as fending off bloodthirsty nightmares and other assorted baddies can get. Because of my want for romance, I'll have to confirm that I'm only looking for partners that are 18+. No exceptions. It's a comfort thing, sorry if that doesn't work out.\n\nAs for me, I'm an experienced roleplayer, with plenty of years under my belt. I tend to prefer a more short, rapid fire posting style, ranging from 1-3 paragraphs per post, depending on the content of the message I'm replying to. Third person perspective, past tense, all that good jazz. Adult themes are good with me, as well, though in moderation. Wouldn't want the RP ruled by that, after all.\n\nI haven't gone into detail what *exactly* I'm looking for yet, have I? Well, allow me to elaborate. I'm looking to set this in a *post* forsaken story timeline. If you've played shadowkeep already, wonderful, we can start from there. If you're starting from new light, and just know the basics, no problem. I'm fairly flexible, and all I ask is that the RP is kept moving forward. But on that note, I'm not looking for a purely action based story. I love the slower stuff. Slow build, idle downtime between characters, just time that isn't bullets flying all over the place. That's not to say I don't want that, just in moderation. You can only write *so* much action before it gets stale, after all.\n\nI should probably cut this here before I go super off track. Simply put, if you enjoy destiny, shoot me a message. I\u2019m sure we can work something out that we\u2019ll both enjoy. I will ask that you know a decent bit about the story (not deep lore, I'm not a stickler for that), as I'd prefer not have to teach it, or subject someone to the entire storyline.\n\nOh, and before I go, please keep in mind that I wrote this while fairly tired. Kinda not a smart idea on my part, but eh, what can ya do?",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nFor the longest time, I've been trying to find a Discord server dedicated to the Dragon Age series, but after coming up short with options, I decided to try making my own.\n\nThe keyword is: try\n\nI have a pretty in-depth premise on what it would consist of, but I could use a lot more creative help on how to bring such a rich and captivating world into a single server. I honestly don't have a lot of experience with building Discord servers and the hundreds of bots that could be made of use, so I was hoping to find a solid group of people who would be interested in building the world of Thedas (And perhaps the Tevintar Empire) with me.\n\nThere aren't many specifications I'm asking for as long as you have some experience with how to assign roles, work bots, and modding (as in moderating not like coding). If you're a big Dragon Age enthusiast or even just a fan of lore enriched fantasy-themed worlds, that's a big plus because the more passionate you are about creating, the better the server will end up becoming. I'll also need someone who can come up with a relatively simple level-up system. Eventually, once the server is completely set up, you would be in charge of creating events, disciplining members, reading through bios, and providing overall support. Of course, I need someone who is also level headed and will not misuse their power as well.\n\nIf you're interested, PM or comment on this thread and I'll send you a link to what I have so far in the server.",

How they got here is unknown and the deaths they caused are in the hundredths of millions. \n\nI have the whole world backstory and my charecter already made, however it is extremely graphic and long, so I'm not allowed to show it on here. I'm okay with some NSFW as long as it dosnt take up most of the RP. I'm also a very busy person but I'll try to reply as fast as I can. As you will see I'm very descriptive and detailed and I would expect the same from my partner, however I dont care if your literate or not as long as your not giving me an anarasime as I'm trying to read it. Message me if your interested but, again it is a very long read if your not okay with that don't message me. Iv had people who said they were interested and as soon as I posted it they were gone. Although if you have any questions though feel free to ask I'll understand if your not interested after I answer questions ^_^. \n\nSorry for the rules I hope you guys find it intresting and have a good day.",

I want that connection that every roleplayer experiences with their partner and their characters! If you also are looking for something that is more than your typical roleplay, then I might be your girl!\n\nI\u2019m interested in many genres and plotlines. I can make a character up for any story and play that character without any trouble. So if you have any storylines that you\u2019ve already planned out, I would absolutely love to hear them! A thing to note is I absolutely must have romance within my roleplays. It adds to the story for me. \n\nDiscord is a must as far as the forum that we roleplay on. I prefer 3rd person, but am willing to do 1st also! \n\nPm if you\u2019re interested!\n\nCheers!",

            "selftext": "Hello to all of you lovely lurkers and fellow roleplay subreddit subscribers! I\u2019m back again with another post because I\u2019m currently looking for some new partners! Autumn is upon us and the days are growing colder. It is officially the best time for curling up with a cup of hot coffee and writing a good story.\n\nBefore I explain some of the ideas I have in mind, let me elaborate a little bit on myself. I\u2019m a 22 year old female who enjoys playing both genders and in most cases can write multiple characters as well. I prefer to write MxF stories but will consider other pairings if the story warrants it. The only thing I\u2019m not flexible on is literacy. I write in 3rd person, past tense, and expect my partners to enjoy adhering to the same. As far as length goes, I average anywhere from 4-6 paragraphs but am capable of doing much more when the situation warrants it. These \u201crequirements\u201d are just to ensure we are as compatible as possible.\n\nI am perfectly fine with NSFW content of all natures as long as it is actually fits into the situation. If you\u2019re looking for someone who writes pure smut, we probably won\u2019t work well together. \n\nWith my boring yet obligatory introduction out of the way, let me get into some of the prompts I have in mind:\n\n-**Slice of Life (With a Twist)**: Though it is typically not my thing, I\u2019ve been craving something along the lines of a typical slice of life romance with a variant to keep it interesting. Are you a killer and I\u2019m a victim you\u2019ve been stalking? Are we a pair of detectives investigating aforementioned killer? Are you a cult leader and I one of your newest followers? Am I the mysterious new girl in town with a dark secret? Are we in an arranged marriage? Any of the scenarios I described could be reversed or alternated on. **(Seriously, cult roleplays are a craving!)**\n \n  - **Horror/Sci-Fi :** With Halloween approaching, I\u2019ve really been craving something in the rough style of Welcome to Night Vale, but darker. If you are not podcast-savvy, the central idea is a small town that is home to all sorts of strange happenings. The cause of these events ranges from paranormal to extraterrestrial and there\u2019s a number of ways that we can approach this. [Lovecraftian horror and suspicious/menacing local government figures galore.] I\u2019m also down for anything involving the supernatural, cryptids, or any other frightening ideas you want to throw my way.\n\n  - **Historical:** After recently re-watching The Hateful 8, my interest in Westerns has been reignited! I\u2019m not looking for anything canon but if you have any ideas ranging from the pure golden age \u201cWild Wild West\u201d to the 1920s, I\u2019m your gal. I also have a looooong idea of my own that I\u2019m not going to type out here, so inquire further if that sounds up your alley!\n\n  - **Renaissance Misadventures:** I don\u2019t have an exact prompt fleshed out for this but I\u2019ve always had an interest in the Italian Renaissance. Assassins, philosophers, soldiers, and cultural revolution; there\u2019s just so many options. A maestro and prodigy dynamic comes to mind.\n\n**Fandoms:** I\u2019m not looking to follow any canon to a T right now but if you\u2019re looking for a fandom role-play or just want to get a better idea of the themes I\u2019m best at writing, I figured I would list a few more things below:\n  - Red Dead Redemption\n  - The Witcher\n  - A Song of Ice and Fire\n  - Days Gone (I love apocalypse tropes)\n  - The Twilight Zone (short stories, anyone?)\n  - Labyrinth\n  - Annihilation (UFO contact sights, research scientists, and black ops) \n  - Tanis/Archive 81/The Black Tapes\n  - Silent Hill\n  - Many, many more that I\u2019m sure I\u2019m leaving out!\n\n\nWoooo, that was a long one! I tried to sum everything up as short as I could but I have a lot of ideas right now and it\u2019s hard not to ramble. If there\u2019s anything I forgot to add that you think would be of interest, don\u2019t hesitate to send me an orange envelope! The worst I can do is say no or suggest some changes, right? I\u2019m also available on Discord and Google Docs.\n\nCiao!",

As for the actual roleplay I love having action, adventure, character development, and really anything that keeps it interesting!

There are a few canons I\u2019d be open to playing which are Margaery Tyrell, Daenerys Targaryen, Sansa Stark, or Arya Stark. \n\n**Marvel/DC**: Here I prefer to play canon but what you do is up to you. As for characters I\u2019d play I like Natasha Romanoff, Wanda Maximoff, Wonder Woman, or Harley Quinn. \n\nI don\u2019t have any specific ideas in mind so if you\u2019re interested message me and we can brain storm.

So let's work with that!\n\nPost-revolution setting and the game could have either ended with a pacifist or anarchist ending. Huge pros and cons for both.\n\nANYWAY Hank's dead. He was already fairly old and whether by age, drink, or accident he's only human. Which leaves Connor without a partner and trying to understand the grieving process. \n\nForced into the role of head of the newly formed Android Crimes Division someone so used to receiving orders now has to give them. A new member is put in Connor's old role, becoming his partner to maintain the division. Unfortunately, revolution or not, they aren't very keen on androids. \n\nShifting to an anarchist end and forwarding time could put humans as the minority in Detroit and even moreso in law enforcement. I'm a huge whore for social dynamics and there's so much to feed off of here.\n\nSo yes, that's that! Darker, dramatic, probably funny moment Detroit RP. No assumption of romance, see what rolls and where the story leads us. \n\n**DM or chat for details; Discord preferred.**\n\n**Looking for someone willing to really world build. I think Detroit has a lot of promise (at least in fantasy) that was barely touched upon in the game.**\n\n**Multiple characters is a huge plus. In need of someone advanced that understands narrative flow. Quality over quantity but expecting posts in the 3 paragraph range at the least once we have our flow going; that's like nine good sentences minimum!**",

Whether it be an interesting crossover with Ooo and Aaa, or simply in Aaa, I'm perfectly happy! I will be playing Fionna as a main, but you can play whoever you choose! Real quick, I'll lay out my rules~\n\n1. Please be literate. I usually like multiparagraph responses, but if you would rather it be a touch shorter, I can work with that as long as there is at least one meaty paragraph. Also, proper grammar and spelling are a must. Of course everyone makes mistakes (I'm sure I've made plenty, just in this post), but I shouldn't have to decypher messages. \n2. I do prefer romance. Like I said, I am fine with you playing anyone in the franchise, and I can play around with most ships. If you don't want to play someone who goes with Fionna, that is fine! I will just ask that we double up so that we can both have a bit of romance to play with. \n3. Drama in a roleplay is amazing, but keep it organic and in the RP. \n4. Please be polite OOC, as I tend to have a hard time enjoying roleplays if I can't get along with my RP partner. \n5. Please be at least 18, as I am over 18. \n6. LGBT+ is more than welcome!",

I\u2019m in the mood for really any sort of role play as long as it takes place in the vast expanse of space! Whether it be the story of two smugglers trying to hide from intergalactic law forces, a pair of commanders working in a galactic army to take down a dictator, or even just a pair of mechanics trying to survive the dangers that their exploration ship often gets into. I would just love to do an rp that captures everything great about shows like Star Wars and Star Trek. The world building, the action, and the many different aliens you could meet. If this sounds like something you\u2019d be interested in then please message me! \n\nHere are some rules though: \n\nI don\u2019t really like writing an essay every post. If it\u2019s a minor scene, say our characters are chatting over dinner, my posts can go to four lines. If it\u2019s a fight, it\u2019ll likely break the character limit. It ranges widely all dependent on the size of my partners posts and the scene of the RP so I\u2019d like someone who is fine with both lengths when they\u2019re appropriate. \n\nThe length I prefer can change depending on what type of rp I\u2019m looking to do. If I want to do an advanced literate rp then I\u2019m probably looking for someone who can hit the character limit consistently rather than someone who can just write a paragraph. \n\nUse quotations when writing dialogue (ex: \"How's life been fairing you?\"). Don't use asterisks (*the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy white dog*). I like messages to be nice and neat.\n\nPlease use proper grammar and refrain from having too many grammatical errors and spelling errors. Yes, I can (mostly) understand those who don't have... let's say... the best grammar, but I'd like for there to be proper grammar and spelling. I don't expect it to be 100% perfect grammar, but at least try to have good grammar.\n\nSpeaking of which, please refrain from using abbreviations (u, ty, np, thx, et cetera) when roleplaying. I don't mind the use of abbreviations outside of roleplay, as I use them myself, but still.\n\nDon't make your character OP or a Mary Sue/Gary Stu. I like to see limitations and weaknesses, and having these, in some cases, can make a character more enjoyable because they're relatable.\n\nAlso please don\u2019t have your character be the super shy, pastel, no backbone type. I have rp\u2019ed with these types of characters before and I just don\u2019t see too much fun in it. Unless I specifically ask for an rp with a character like this then I\u2019ll most likely ask for you to play another character",

I like almost all genres but I'll list a few specific ones below!\n\nRomantic Slice of Life: I have a few prompts for this including roommates, neighbors, classmates, and more. Feel free to suggest your own if you'd like!\n\nFandoms: \n\nRimworld and Kenshi: These aren't fandoms so to speak but I'd love to rp in the setting of these games! I love the gritty reality of them and I'd love to rp them!\n\nGame of Thomes: I love Game of Thrones despite the last season and would love to do either Robb x Margaery for this or OC x OC!\n\nSpiderman: I recently got back into spiderman and I'd love to do a peter parker x mary jane rp! The canon we'd se would be the spiderman game canon from 2018!\n\nAs it says in the title, this is 18+ only. I'm 18+ and I don't feel comfortable rping with anyone under that. Thanks for reading!",

            "selftext": "Hello all! I've decided to go on a hunt for some roleplay partners. First, a bit about myself. \n\nI am a 20 year old girl who loves to create characters of all kinds and act out roleplays that are funny, romantic, and worth the time invested. While I do have my moments of business or tiredness, I am pretty free most the time. I roleplay in 3rd Person and my personal favorite genres are slice of life and/or modern fantasy mixed with romance. I'm not too picky on length but my comfort zone is 2-15+ lines depending on my level of creativity and how much the other person puts out. I do prefer LGBT roleplays although I can do straight roleplays. I prefer our characters to be able to change out on the who wears the pants role or for me to be the lesser pants wearer. Most of my characters are less masculine  or ambiguous. EST Time Zone.\nNow onto preferences for my partner. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMUSTS: \n\nMust be willing and able to have or create a decently fleshed out character. I have a character template that I use for my ocs if you need one. Character tropes are fine, although I take some issue with some but as long as they go beyond that trope and are their own person beyond 1 or 2 character traits, they're fine!\n\nMust have decent grammar and spelling. Now I know nobody's grammar or spelling is perfect, but I need to be able to understand what you're typing. \n\nMust reply at least every other day. I understand being busy and having times where you can't reply for a few days but id like to be notified if and when those things happen. I usually wait 4-7 days for someone to reply and will send the occasional 'hi' or 'hey' as a reminder. (Note: I also encourage you to be annoying to get me to reply. Sometimes I get distracted to the point of forgetting to reply or Discord won't send my reply or won't notify me when you reply. Send me reminders. If I ghost you it's never on purpose.) \n\nMUST NOT GHOST. I get being busy or even not wanting to roleplay with me. LET ME KNOW. So many people tend to ghost  when They get busy or dont want to tell me that they're not feeling me or the roleplay. Tell me. That way I know and can have a little closure. \n\nHave Discord.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEXTRA POINTS IF (you do not have to share these but it helps if you do)\n\nYou roleplay LGBT (Admittedly I enjoy RPing MxM most- so even more points in that case!)\n\nYou like multiple RPs, multiple characters to be going on at once \n\nYou like talking and developing the RP as its happening\n\nYou are okay with rping as/with ocs who are mentally ill or physically disabled in some way. \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSend me a message telling me about you, what you like/don't like in a roleplay, and if you hit any of the extra points! Make sure it's a message and not a chat/comment as I typically don't answer those as often.  If you messaged me and I didn't answer I was probably busy! Feel free to Send me another message! I look forward to role-playing with you!! Please send the keyphrase \"Don't ask Don't Pas-tell\" somewhere in your message so I know you read through everything. I probably won't respond otherwise.",

            "selftext": "[M4F](HERO FACTORY AU) a darker version of the Lego series hero factory. This plot involves an alien invasion on Earty, 6 units known as the hero squad were dispatched to respond to the first wave of invaders, no one knew what would follow. All 6 were slain and the alien race enforced their rule of the planet. 8 years later we meet your character, a 24 year old refugee who's been keeping a secret for the last 4 years, in her shed is a cobbled together hero unit, made from the parts she could recover of the 6 deceased. This new hero was a vast upgrade to the others, and he was almost complete. \n\n[M4A](Star Wars) during the time of the empire, there were many great battles. Yavin 4, the death star and so on. This plot follows 2 storm troopers as the rebellion continues to grow. (It takes place between ESB and ROTJ) you can form your own imperial character (rank, specialization etc) there is a plot in mind for the beginning but it's also a bit of world building as we go kind of rp. \n\n[M4F](DC) a classic hero vs villian storyline, we see 2 ocs of mine, Cian Alexandre and Petra, Deathstrokes adopted daughter. The reason for their fighting is up to us, we can build their dynamic together or, you can create a new villian entirely! \n\n[M4A](halo) during the height of the great schism, a noble Sangheili warrior rose to the occasion, this is from the perspective of the covenant side of the battle, we see how a powerful Elite was able to break the tension between the local battle that ensued and how he created a rebellion against the covenant that even the some of the brutes wanted in on. \n\n[M4F](marvel) everyone loves a Spider-man story, the spider bites, uncle Ben's many responsibility talks before his death and so on. This one is not that. You and I were 2 highschool students, because of our high grades we often got into honors class and as such often went on feild trips, we were part of a trip to Osborn laboratories. As the feild trip went on the 2 of us sidetracked to the experimental spider exhibit. You can see where this is going. The both of us were bitten by one of the few escape spiders and for the first time 2 spider-people were born.\n\nI hope one or more of these intrigued you! Keep in mind I kind of dumped them down to keep them shorter, and any clarifications or more in depth explanation can be discussed in PM! That being said feel free to message me for one or more of these plots! I may not be so open to having 3 of the same plots going on so if I get a reply going for one I may take it off the post!\n\nHope to hear from some of you!",

Fallout? Sure! Zombies? Bring \u2018em on! One of our own devising? Sounds fun! \n\nI usually have a main character I focus the most on, but I always play other characters as well. The world may be sparsely populated, but there are still other people! I like a romance angle in my rps, but it\u2019s not *absolutely* necessary. I\u2019m just all about relationships, whether they are romantic or platonic. \n\nIf we do add romance, my pairing preferences are as follows; fxf, mxm, mxf with me playing male, mxf with me playing female \n\nI guess I\u2019m what would be known as literate? I have good grasp of the English language. My posting length varies depending on what is happening, but it rarely dips below at least two paragraphs. \n\nOh, and also you need to be 18+, not because the rp is necessarily going to be smut, but because I well am and interacting with a minor world just be uncomfortable for me personally. \n\nSo uh.

            "selftext": "To the west, a sprawling city ruled by mages wielding power beyond belief...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo the north, a land of nature where elves, dwarves, and orcs fight for dominance in a fierce and bloody conflict...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo the east, a lifeless empire destroyed by an unknown calamity...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo the south, two kingdoms of humans side by side, set ablaze by war...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the middle of the ocean that divides them all, a never ending storm that swallows all who dare to draw close...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is the world of Eridesia, and it calls for you! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur story begins in the southernmost continent of Ackria. Two human led kingdoms exist side by side, separated by a strong mountain range to the north and a harsh desert to the south. To the west lies the kingdom of Rominus, to the east sits the kingdom of Aradesh. To understand the current situation between these two kingdoms, one must understand the nature of magic in Eridesia. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCenturies ago, magic was a gift granted to all people by the six gods of this world by the power of magic crystals. Each person could attune to a single specific color of crystal, channeling one of the six elements of water, fire, earth, air, life, and death. For a time, people used these powers to better their own lives and the lives of others, but as with all things, there came those who grew greedy. A plot was formed, to steal the very power of the gods themselves. When this plot failed, the gods cursed the people of the world by confiscating the ability to wield magic. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter delivering their divine punishment, the gods disappeared from this world, leaving humanity and the other races of the world to their fates. The crystals showered upon the earth so long ago remained, and as centuries passed, some individuals regained the ability to attune to these crystals and wield their magical might once more. Over time, this magical force that some could control came to be referred to as Ethrium, and those who possessed it came to be known as Ethrium Wielders. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn current times, magic is seen differently all across the world. In the north, the primal lands of Garnefel see magic as a rare gift, and those who can wield Ethrium are meant to be great leaders or powerful warriors. To the west sits the grand city of Lavel, where the College of Magi resides alongside the vast majority of the world's Wielders. There, the land is ruled by a council of six mages. There, they embrace magic in all of its forms, using Ethrium to power strange machines such as airships. To possess Wielding skills puts you above those who do not. Those with magic are meant to rule, and those without are meant to serve. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the land of Ackria, Rominus, having a healthy trading relationship with Lavel, accepts magic and welcomes mages within their border. To the east, magic is outlawed entirely in Aradesh, with most Wielders being executed on sight. To the people of Aradesh, magic is the root of sin, and the cause of the Gods abandonment of this world. Despite the differences of these kingdoms, they lived in relative peace, choosing to leave each other alone to their own devices. That is until one day unexpectedly, the armies of Rominus crossed the desert to the south and invaded Aradesh. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe initial invasion was swift and brutal, with the Rominian armies overtaking the southern fortresses of Aradesh with ease before carving a brutal path north through hundreds of towns and villages. It was months before the King of Aradesh could form a proper army from the capital of Goldcrest and lead them south to face the invaders. The armies of Rominus had already crossed halfway through Aradesh before a true army opposed them. It was there that a fateful battle took place near a vibrant forest known as the Maplethorn Woodlands, overlooked by a peaceful town known as Greenrest. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOutside that town, the armies of Rominus devastated the defending forces of Aradesh. The royal host was shattered, the king retreated, and the Rominian forces prepared to advance for an assault on the capital. Greenrest sits near one of the kingdom's main roads. Knowing its importance for protecting supply lines, the general of the Rominian army, Lord Tygan Westmore, leaves his second eldest son Tyrious with a token force to protect the town from any forces who would attempt to cut off supplies to the main army. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEager to take charge of his first command, Tyrious takes his duty seriously, despite the relative lack of apparent danger. Between a populace that despises their unwanted occupiers, spies within the town, and a growing resistance in the nearby forest, Tyrious is already in for more than he could ever bargain for. On top of all of that, he is soon to be thrust into the center of the grand conspiracy that shadows the true reason for this sudden invasion, springing him on a quest that will take him across all of Eridesia in search of the truth...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnly one question remains.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat role with you play?\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHey everyone! Thanks for reading my prompt. I hope that you enjoyed it! As you can probably tell, I am in search of a long term partner for this prompt. I'm intending for it to be an engaging story with themes of adventure, drama, action, and romance. The story begins in one small part of the world but I intend for the heroes to travel all across the world, visiting all of the major locations mentioned. I'm aware that this may seem like I already have most of this story planned out, but I really just have some initial story beats for both of us to build off of together. I don't really know where it will all go aside from the fact that I do want this to be a world spanning adventure. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is a very D&amp;D inspired type of medieval fantasy adventure, with some steampunk elements (the gigantic city filled with mages, mainly). My main character, Tyrious and whoever you play will be the main heroes, but they will have a part of people who tag along for a good deal of the adventure to help them. I love filling my stories with as many memorable characters as I can to make them feel alive, but I always have a central main character. I encourage you to fill the world with characters of your own, so we can build a living world together. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would like for there to be a slow building romance between our main characters, but I enjoy have side romances and scenes with side characters who get their own spotlights and \"screen time\" as well, so to speak. I love fight scenes, so there will certainly be combat and action. If there is to be fighting between a character I control and a character you control, I do like to discuss things beforehand so that we reach a realistic outcome. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOOC discussion is a big thing that I look for in my roleplay partners, for discussing the story and also for the chance at becoming friends as we write together. As for your main character, I encourage you to make whatever sort of character that you want. Someone from the defending kingdom would make for an interesting dynamic, as I personally enjoy a pairing where the two start out as enemies but eventually start to work together. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOverall, I just want to create an epic adventure with someone. I don't care if you're male or female or your character is male or female. I have no real preference. I would just love to hear from you, answer any of your questions, or hear your ideas!

I am advanced literate, occasionally semi-literate depending on the partner/scene. I do prefer longer writing!\n\nI am interested in tons of roleplay genres whether it be fandom, romantic, apocalyptic, drama, fantasy, medieval, Sci-Fi, etc. I really don\u2019t mind as long as it\u2019s plot driven and fun. Also okay with smut as long as it doesn\u2019t become the main focus of the plot and it isn\u2019t consistent. \n\nI write in both first and third person, so if you have a preference for either of the two, let me know and I\u2019ll easily do it! (:\n\nI am available all day today, as well as Mondays. Tuesday-Friday, I am out all day in class and at work, but I will be able to respond on my several breaks throughout the day. I am in Mountain Time, and I am available every night usually from 9pm-1am before I head to sleep. Hopefully our schedules match up and we can play!\n\nAvailable on a couple platforms such as Discord and Kik. Prefer Discord, but I\u2019m also available to chat in PMs or on Reddit Chat.\n\nHope to hear from all of you! (\u2018:\n\nAlex",

            "selftext": "Hello there!\n\nI am currently searching for long term RP partners for some interesting RPs.\n\nA little bit about me:\n\nI am a 20 year old female with about 7 or 8 years of experience and even longer writing experience (~9 or 10). \n\nEST time zone\n\nI RP third person and my responses range anywhere from several paragraphs to even a page depending on what is happening in the RP.  (I also do try to match responses, but my responses also tend to be a bit detailed and on the long side)\n**Please be able to give me a well thought out reply. Not just a meager paragraph or a few lines with nothing that I can continue off of**\n\nIf for some reason you grow bored or disinterested please do let me know and we can fix it or try something else completely. \n\nI love chatting outside of RP whether it be about our characters, future plot points, coming up with characters in AU\u2019s or just general chat! Although if that\u2019s not your thing then no worries!\n\nI do have a full time job and have responsibilities after so my responses may be dependent. Often times it can get a bit overwhelming so I apologize if my responses get a bit spotty here and there. I get to them when I can.\n\nFor fandom RPs, I can do canon and OC characters (although I am more used to canon), and I can play both males and females. I also love to RP multiple characters (more plot devices and interaction that way) Character interaction, development, and world building is a must! I love building things to it\u2019s full potential. \n\nAlso, I do quite enjoy looking at characters from different angles even if that means switching between character POV in the RP, but if you\u2019re more of a one or two character interaction type of person that\u2019s fine, but I certainly don\u2019t mind playing side characters or extras to bring the world to life.\n\nSome games I have played: (I am perfectly fine to play against an OC for any of these!) \n\nI will put asterisks next to ones I am inspired for or that I know the most about.\n\n\nDetroit: Become Human *** \n\u2014I can play any of the canon characters but at the moment I am most interested in a Gavin and RK900, and I could settle for anything with Hank and Connor even including an OC if you preferred as well. I also have several plots in mind for this one.\n\nFinal Fantasy (4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10-2, 13, 13-2, 13-3, 15 and Kingsglaive, Dissidia, Crisis Core) \n\u2014I can play any of the canon characters from these as well! **\n\nTales (Berseria, Xillia, and Graces f) \n\nLegend of Zelda (MM, TP, WW, SS, BOTW) **\n\u2014Canon or OC\n\u2014I do have a plot in mind for something BOTW\n\nTelltales The Walking Dead \n\u2014I do have a plot for this one\n\nThe Last of Us (or similar universe)\n\nNier Automata \n\nSpider-Man (PS4 2018)\n\n\nShows/movies:\n\nMarvel\n\u2014most movies including Spiderverse and also daredevil, not so much comics \n\nSherlock * \n\u2014Canon\n\nMiraculous LB *\n\u2014Canon or OC \n\nRWBY \n\u2014Canon or OC \n\nSword Art Online Arc 1 &amp; 2 (more the universe)\n\nSword Art Online Season 2 (more the universe)\n\nStranger Things ***\n\u2014I do have a plot for this one\n\nAngel Beats *\n\nDarker than Black \n\nOHSHC\n\nIT *\n\nCarnival Row ***\n\u2014&gt; Canon or OCs in the same general universe\n\nHobbs and Shaw **\n\u2014&gt; I\u2019d like to play Hattie or Deckard, or perhaps OCs in the same general setting of MI6, spies etc etc etc. \n\n**Not a complete list of fandoms**\n\n\n\nOriginal ideas I enjoy: (Plot and character ideas depend on your preferences)\n\n\u2014Fantasy (medieval, magical elements, kingdoms, different races, even adding in tech like airships, modern weapons, and exploring more than one and a variety of aspects as well. There\u2019s so much more I could add but it would take forever.)\n\u2014\u2014war themes, royal themes, different aspects of life themes, pirates, bandits, etc etc etc.\n\n\u2014Modern settings and futuristic settings as long as they have some sort of non slice of life or non day to day type aspect. I like action and adventure and excitement in these types of settings. \n\n\u2014Romance (MxF and possibly FxF and I DO NOT RP SMUT. More of a fade to black sort of person) I also thoroughly enjoy building it up over time.\n\n\u2014Action/Adventure\n\n\u2014Angst/Drama\n\nI am sure there are more things I am forgetting. \n\nI would be fine exploring any other sorts of themes/plots genres except Sci-Fi and Slice of life (normal themes would need some convincing as I find it difficult to keep it going) as I like some sort of magical or fictional aspect to it. I can be persuaded depending on the plot.\n\nIf you have any other suggestions/ideas/plots/settings as to what you would like to do then please shoot me a PM with a bit about you and your interests and we can discuss! Give me a bit about your interests and preferences! I am open to nearly anything!\n\nIf you need a sample of my writing, please do not be afraid to ask! \n\nMy platforms are Kik, Discord, Skype, Email, Google Docs and Reddit PM",

            "selftext": "Hello there! Back again looking for some more quality RP partners. This time around I'm doing something a bit different, but familiar. I say this because I've done two similar stories with the general idea of superpowers, although they had some differences in terms of characters, their age and some other lore details. Before we get to the plot summary, I should mention that this story can and will have dark themes. It is not meant for the faint-hearted. I should also mention that while this summary will seem basic, there are MANY layers underneath that are going to make for some intense storytelling that I hope my partners will enjoy. I also expect my partner to be just as creative or inspired to create an amazing roleplay, but we'll get to that soon.  \n\n\nThe general story outline is as follows:  \nTaking place in New York City (Manhattan), 2019 (although technology is slightly more advanced), two young adults at the age of 18--a brother and a sister--are among the few rarities of the world. They are humans born with a power of some sort. These humans are so rare that most of the population aren't aware of their existence. The U.S. government makes an effort of finding these powered people and 'taking' them for experimentation, although they normally have no way of searching for powered people. Police reports are typically the way these powered people are discovered--and those that are 'taken' by the government are never seen again.  \n\n\nThe brother and his delinquent friend are heading to classes one morning. Their lives will change in more ways than they can count after meeting your character--another powered person.  \n\n\nWill it be for better--or for worse?  \n==========================================================================  \nThat's the super duper basic outline of the plot! Now let's get to what I'm looking for in a partner/some notes:\n\n* 18+ in age! Like I said earlier, this story will have some dark themes. I'm not opposed to some slice of life moments, however, expect this story to be geared towards progression because oh boy it's gonna be a long one.\n* Which brings me to this point. Be prepared for a long term RP!\n* Decent reply rate. Three to four replies per day, minimum. I understand that sometimes people can get busy and I totally get that. Tell me if this is the case for a few days and I'll be patient--however I do wish to move the story along. If you're somebody that can get in a ton of replies in a day, you're awesome!\n* Literate. I want to understand what you're saying and that's all I ask for. You don't have to know a lot of big words but you have to know how to write properly.\n* Speaking of literacy, I'm looking for partners that can match my lengthier replies! They aren't too horribly big but when I write a response that's multiple paragraphs and I only receive one in return, that's really bleh. Two paragraphs minimum, and try to shoot for more if possible. Fast paced combat/back and forth chatter calls for short responses so I'm okay with that!\n* Friendly OOC is cool too :)\n* Passion! I love a partner that becomes just as invested into the RP as I do. I find if my partner is excited about the RP that they tend to put in more effort.\n* I expect you to world build with me, at least a little bit! \n* Work with me when you're creating your power. It's kind of a spoiler, but I need to know that your power isn't too crazy. No reality warping powers--for example--stopping time. Anything along those lines is a no-no. Don't be afraid to have an interesting or strong power, though!  \n\n\nOkay that's all I can think of for now. If I think of anything else I'll bring it up. If you're interested, shoot me a DM and we'll discuss a few things before heading on over to Discord. Thanks for reading! =)",

            "selftext": "Hello! \n\nI\u2019m a 19+ year old female, that is on the look out for new partners to roleplay abroad with. I\u2019ve been roleplaying for quite some time now, and I tend to write multiple paragraphs like I would a story if I\u2019m in a good mood. I\u2019m trying to look for someone who is up to par or close with my writing skills. As well as a plot that we can both fall in love with, and have many more along the way!\n\nThe length depends on how much detail you put into it. Do enough to where the scene will make sense and where I can base off of it. If you want to go above and beyond? By all means, go right ahead! I live in the (MT) zone and I\u2019m typically active on the weekends or whenever I\u2019m available. Monday\u2019s-Friday\u2019s may be times where I may or may not send you a post. Please be patient with me, as I deal with real life matters and competing. \n\nI\u2019d very much like it if I could use my OC(s), and I can do canons as well. Sorry to say, but if you have an OC I might or might not want to roleplay with you. I\u2019ve had a bad experience in the past where a person - who shall remain nameless - made their character the full center of attention 24/7. It annoyed me, and I politely asked them to stop. I like to have a balanced score for a story, where two people get equal amounts of the cheese. This person, however, wouldn\u2019t abide by it. So, if you are a person who only does canon characters then that would be very helpful for me. I\u2019m sorry if you find this quite troublesome, but this is how I prefer it.\n\nNow, there are some rules that I do want to address while I\u2019m here:\n1) NO GODMODDING. I\u2019ve had plenty of instances where I have met people who like to control my characters and not let me have a chance to try and set up my actions. Please, for the love of anything good and holy, don\u2019t do that. It will become annoying. (Plus, I\u2019ve heard of something called infomodding. Don\u2019t do that either. You would never know my character\u2019s powers unless discussed with me first.)\n\n2) No Mary/Gary Sues. I\u2019ve run into these guys too, and it isn\u2019t much fun when one character has all the powers and controls absolutely EVERYTHING. For every strength, there are weaknesses to it. \n\n3) Don\u2019t bring anything political to the round table, end of story. I don\u2019t want other\u2019s opinions shoved down my throat via ask box and IM. Just don\u2019t do it. \n\n4) If you are a supporter of MAPs, Nazism, Anti-vacation, etc. do not even try on following me, sister. \n\n5) If anything at all is in the slightest hint of NSFW, let there be chemistry first. I don\u2019t want anything to go quick.\n\n6) Please, please don\u2019t bring me into drama! I\u2019m not one for being involved in anything excessive, and I don\u2019t want to be dragged into it. I will report it if anything gets excessive. \n\n7) If you have any triggers please do tell me! I\u2019d love it if you could tell me beforehand, so I know what I can do to work my way around something like that.\n\n8) Lastly, let\u2019s have fun! Let\u2019s talk out of character, create what we like, and just go wild. Headcanons, moodboards, etc. \n\nIf we write together, when we plot, let\u2019s make it interesting. I\u2019m into anything that involves, horror, sci-fi, action, and romance. Mainly horror, haha! I\u2019m a person who is involved into multiple fandoms- and I\u2019d love to do something that involves my passion. Just ask me which fandoms I like, and I\u2019ll happily send some suggestions over your way! \n\nI do SFW and NSFW. Please tell me your age, as I don\u2019t want you or me to get in trouble. Also, please roleplay in third person. \n\nIMPORTANT: Now, onto the fun bit. Mainly, I\u2019ve been trying to find someone who is into \u201cIt.\u201d I\u2019ve seen both the 2017 and 2019 movies, and have read the book three times. I know my stuff, and know a lot of it. If you\u2019re someone who is interested- shoot me a DM! \u201cIt\u201d is the fandom that I prefer to roleplay at the moment. \n\nI also roleplay on Kik, Discord, or here. Discord being preferred as I respond quicker there and have a faster reaction time. If you have any questions, fire away! I\u2019d also like to see an example of how you write, if that\u2019s okay with you. \n\nThank you for taking your time to read this! \u2764\ufe0f",

            "selftext": "Before I start. I want it to be clear this is not going to have smut. \n\n\" The year is 2020. A new Island off the coast of the U.S.A. Is found. It was around the size of Great Britain, and U.S.A. takes it over. Many citizens move in, becoming a very popular island to live in. In the year 2032, a corrupt political leader in Spain starts WW3. In the year 2037 Japan nukes the island as payback for Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Afterwards the US invade Japan, making it apart of USA. 2 years later, WW3 is over, Spain going down and the leader being assassinated. In the Island off of the coast of USA, some strange things happen, but the US government says the place is uninhabitable and doesn\u2019t send anyone back for hundreds of years. During those years, Genetic mutations happen to survivors of the blast, mixing DNA from multiple animals, causing a lot of mutation, and having other strange affects on the land. In 2296, a group of scientists show up on the island after getting turned around to find out that the nuclear explosion made brand new life. Different mix breeds of animals (including humans), mix breeds of plants, plants and animal DNA mixed, and some new animals from rapid evolution caused by the explosion. Monster people were commonplace, and normal humans were rare. Humans were called \u201cperfections\u201d and mostly human mixes were called \u201csemi-perfections\u201d. 3 main groups battled. One group said Perfections were a disease, and needed to be killed. One group praised them like they were gods, and the final group just thought they were like anything else. Another effect of the blast was dead animals and humans would rise up from the ground, causing anything they bite to become a zombie like them. Scientists started to frequent the island to learn about how this happened. Capturing some of the residents and taking them in camps to further learn about them\"\n\nThis is a pretty open apocalypse roleplay. Open to a nuclear apocalypse or a zombie, or a mix of both. You can be whoever you want, a perfection, semi perfection or a mutant. Be whatever you want, for the most part I'm fine with it as long as you dont become like a boss from Duke Nukem. If you have any preferred ideas just share them with me.\n\nI dont really like doing big long texts. just like 1-2 sentences should be enough",

            "selftext": "Yo!\n\nI'm Ink, I've been roleplaying for many years, and have been into Naruto for longer. Actually, Naruto is the fandom that got me into roleplaying. My writing has improved significantly since those middle school days, but unfortunately not my humor. I've also shipped SasuSaku for just as long. \n\nCurrently, I'm looking for someone to write Sakura to my Sasuke! And in return, I'm willing to write just about any character in any pairing -- even CanonxOC, doesn't have to be canon compliment, and can be any gender pairing.\n\nA bit about me as a writer, what I'm looking I'm for, and what you can expect:\n--**DETAIL:** Depending on the scene, how many characters are involved, and generally what\u2019s going on, my posts can range anywhere from a minimum of 300 words to 1000+. I firmly believe in quality &gt; quantity, so while I necessary don\u2019t expect my partner to match my length, I do want to write with someone who puts thought and time into their posts.\n--**COMMUNICATION:** I\u2019m perfectly fine with, even enjoy, OOC chatter. Also, as with all human interactions, I believe communication is needed for smooth sailing. Not having fun? Did something make you uncomfortable? Did you not understand something in my post, or did I accidentally misunderstand yours? Got an interesting idea to add to the story? Let me know! I\u2019ll always more than willing to work things out.\n--**ACTIVITY:** This will most likely be a bit sporadic on my side. While some days (depending on the length of my replies) I might be able to post a few times a day, others I will only be able to do one, and it might turn out that I\u2019m only able to fit a few posts in a particular week. I understand life comes first, will not pressure my partner to reply, and ask for patience in return.\n--**RP Platform:** I prefer for the roleplay to take place over Discord, but can be convinced to do email or gdocs.\n\n**A Few Ideas:**\n--Something set during Sasuke and Sakura's post-canon travels (more indepth plot available).\n---Mafia/Yakuza AU\n--Non-Massacre AU, where Itachi and Shisui are still alive.\n--Feudal Japan AU.",

I have a night of doing absolutely nothing for once and what better way to spend it than roleplaying? \n\nAs the title says, I do have a few different ideas I\u2019d be willing to share and discuss. I understand that some of them aren\u2019t really for everybody, so I have some more slice of life ones as well! There\u2019s a good assortment. Realistic horror, slice of life, dark, pregnancy related, and a few other genres/options. \n\nI write in the first person and I\u2019d like you to use the same point of view. My average length per reply is about 3 decent sized paragraphs. I DO include smut in every roleplay. If smut is ever an issue for you then I\u2019m not the girl for you! I don\u2019t like to revolve the entire roleplay around pure smut but I have to include it somewhere. It\u2019s fun to me! \n\nIf you read all of my post and you think that we could get something fun going, go ahead and send me a message! I have nothing else to do tonight. Thanks for reading!!",

I enjoy making detailed replies that are multiple paragraphs long, but I won\u2019t require this of my partners. Whatever length or detail matches the pace of the story is fine with me. I can play any gender of character, and enjoy romance, but greatly prefer FxF and MxF pairings. \n\nI am hoping to find a partner who won\u2019t expect daily replies as I do work and I have a few other role-plays going with others. I am active, and I tend to make a couple of replies a week. I will always update you if I am unable to reply right away. \n\nI am currently hoping to find someone who would be willing to try out any of these themes\n\n* Superheroes - Perhaps one of our characters is a hero and the other is a villain, maybe they are both attending a school to train to be professional heroes, or they could be on the same super hero team and fight crime in a world where superheroes maintain the law, anything is a possibility\n* Adventure\n* Enemies/Rivals to lovers\n* Romance\n* Fantasy- Either modern or medieval. I've been dying to build a character who could be a werewolf. If that interests you then let's work on a plot that could fit either one or both of our characters as werewolves.\n* NSFW or SFW themes, I am okay with either. I prefer to keep NSFW stuff to a minimum, but I won't unnecessarily censor my writing. This is why I want 18+ partners, also because I prefer partners closer to my age.\n\nI tend to use art for pictures of my character, I usually make art of my characters after I have a few references for what I'd like them to look like. I tend to match what my partner uses, though. If you prefer real human face claims, then I'll do that too. Easier to picture our characters together that way. \n\nIf any of this interests you, or if you have any ideas related to these topics, let me know!",

This all stopped when the World Government\u2019s Marines came along, capturing the Pirate King and sentencing him to death. However, just before he died the Pirate King spoke his last words, screaming them to the Heavens, telling all that he had hid his treasure, the One Piece, at the end of the Grand Line, and encouraged all to seek it out.\n\nThis has sparked the interest of many a generation, encouraging people to go out and become pirates to claim riches for themselves, creating \u2018The Great Pirate Age\u2019.\n\nSo for those of you who don\u2019t know, this roleplay is inspired by One Piece, the popular manga/anime of the same name, however you don\u2019t need to know anything about One Piece.\n\nNow what am I looking for? Well I\u2019m hoping to find a partner that wants to sail the seas with me as a pirate, adventuring from island to island, raising our bounties as we go and forming a mighty crew. More details can be discussed over messages.\n\nNow for writing style, I am pretty easy on this, I don\u2019t mind if we roleplay 1st or 3rd person and I don\u2019t mind about your post length as long as I\u2019m able to reply to it.\n\nI hope this post has interested you and if so please shoot me a message.",

I'm in college and work so I'm a little busy but usually can reply at least once a day if not every other day. I'm a large fan of modern slice of life, magic, and anything that's drama filled. Also I am a large believer in ooc talk so I'm the type for playlists, mood boards, and general rambling. I think becoming friends with my partners is an important part.\n\nSo what am I looking for in a partner?  \n\\-Must be 18+ for comfort\n\n\\-Must be female, willing to play a f/f pairing since that's just my comfort zone.\n\n\\-Must be able to reply a few times a week.\n\n\\-One to however many paragraphs and decent grammar.\n\n\\-Willing to write on discord.\n\nAs for plots, I'm currently interested in the following or am willing to hear what your ideas are as well. Ideas are in order of interest.\n\n\\-Modern slice of life. Literally anything in this genre. Roommates, met at a bar or party, coworkers, met online, we can talk about this.\n\n\\-Modern fantasy. Boarding houses for different supernatural people, magic schools, living in secret, any of it.\n\n\\-Famous People. Youtubers, celebrities, singers, anything meeting and navigating that world.\n\nHope to hear from you!",

I'm going to try to make this short and sweet, it's been a while since I've gone looking for new partners.\n\n\\*I write either gender, for any pairing. So long as I'm not writing all the males for all your females, I'm good. Right now I'm looking to have one main character but I love having minor characters and NPCs. I might double depending on the plot.\n\n\\*Response length ranges from a few smaller paragraphs to longer more novel like posts. I don't do word counts on post. Really it's quality over quantity with me! As long as it's a compelling post that moves the story forward in some way, I'm good :)\n\n\\*Typically I aim for between one and a couple posts a day. I'd like a partner who can match that.\n\n\\*Communication is key with me! If something comes up and you'll be gone for a while, just let me know. I'll do the same for you. I'm in nursing school and I work part time. My replies can be a little slow on occasion but when that happens I do always let my partners know.\n\n\\*I prefer to write over Discord, or Reddit if people write on here?\n\n\\*I'll do character sheets on request. I don't like doing super detailed ones as I like leaving character details to be discovered through the role play itself. I'm good with no face claims or realistic ones. I just don't vibe with cartoon/anime face claims for some reason.\n\n\\*I'm a fade to black kinda gal\n\n\\*I ask my partners be 18+. I'm 19 fyi, don't care if you're older than me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow onto the fun stuff, my ideas/cravings :) These are vague because I like building plots with my partners!\n\n\\*Mafia/crime: Modern setting. Be it playing characters from rival families, supernatural elements, what have you I'm all ears and down to brainstorm.\n\n\\*Androids: Futuristic/Apocalypse setting. Ideally I play a female human against a male android.\n\n\\*Supernatural hunters/creatures: Modern setting. Not the show but similar. I like the cliche stuff sometimes okay?\n\n\\*Gladiators: Historical or fantasy. Potential characters are the gladiators, their owners, healers. I'd be down to double for this one more so than the other ideas.\n\n\\*My female scientist was contracted by the military to find and 'rehabilitate' a male super solider who had been cryogenically frozen. Trouble ensues.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's all for now! PM me or comment and we'll talk :)",

I am looking for a GM to lead my character on a magical quest to help them master their magical abilities, and hopefully gain some potential suitors on the way. Or maybe they\u2019re a princess/prince? There are many options for this and I am happy to hear all of your ideas! \n\nIn terms of pairings, I can do M x M (my favorite) M x F (with me as F) or F x F. \n\n1. Please be literate! No bad grammar or text talk! Third person only!\n\n2. Please be reasonably active. No ghosting. I realize life gets busy, however if you only reply once in a blue moon, I am not for you. Please communicate if you\u2019ll be away for a long period of time (I will understand and do the same). \n\n3. You must be 18+. I will not roleplay with anyone younger than eighteen, no exceptions. \n\n4. I do not use a set stock of characters. I always make a character specifically to a plot. For roleplaying with me, please do the same. I respect if you have your own already, I\u2019m just not one for inserting one character into every plot. Please be okay with this. \n\nI welcome people of all gender expressions, and also check out my other ads too! Thank you for reading and I hope to hear from you soon! Please feel free to shoot me PM if any of this interested you!",

So feel free to suggest your ideas and I'll see if it speaks to me or not. Expect me to be pretty hype about whatever we are doing. Im the type to constantly spam my partner with images, ideas etc. I also like finding faceclaims, so there is that. If that isn't to your liking, feel free to say so. I will hold myself back.\n\nNSFW themed rps aren't an issue, so long as it doesn't take away from the plot.\u00a0\n\nSome of the fandoms I enjoy include Marvel, ASOIAF/GoT and The Witcher. I have a ton more, but these are the ones Im interested in for now. Im also a sucker for anything fantasy, mythology or western themed.\n\nId love to hear from some of you, and thank you for reading this thread.\n\nMuch love,\u00a0\n\nMunch",

And yet\u2026\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer aged farther, the Garlian King, had managed to gather all he could from the inner court and fled outside, onto the grand stone stair way leading to the palace. The ornate building itself had collapsed and burned from the eldritch assault, but its approach and outer-yard were relatively safe compared to the rest of the roaring city. A thundercrack broke through the screams, sobs and flame, a fork of lighting lashing out from the storm cloud sky, ripping through the very air itself. Distant nightmares of bulbous dark mass scrambled hungrily over shattering rooftops and monstrously sized bird like-atrocities patrolled the shattering skies; daemons trampling through what was once the world she knew. At the base of the palace steps huddled a small platoon of knights, perhaps the last, defiantly holding back a mass of freshly animated corpses, quite obviously their fellow comrades who had been slain just moments before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe wise old once-warrior king stared at the gravely and gripped her hand tight. His only child. The last gift from his departed wife. How he wished he could guarantee her survival. The light of his life. The holder of his dreams. Retinue guards, advisers, a handful of palace servants and the ever enigmatic bright aelf ambassador stood beside the pair of them, gazing silently across the writhing city.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA sudden crash of collapsing air erupted from the struggle at the base of the steps, a great invisible force tearing knight and undead alike into the cold air, only to have them come crashing down again with a howling roar. Bodies turned to pulp from the sudden slamming velocity and warped steel that had just seconds ago been master crafted armor clattered unceremoniously onto the red mist now settling against the cobbled ground. An impossibly fast shadow fell across her vision as she caught only the slightest glimpse of a daemon soaring through the air directly above, rising after a long and terrifyingly silent dive. Its featureless head stretched outward while an oversized mouth crammed with grinding, human like teeth curled into a sick snarl, leather wings pounding with heavy, powerful beats. It let out a piercing screech and span victoriously in the air, climbing higher. It was only then when she noticed the figure that had shed itself from its back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt had the more imposing stance of a human, but its slender, elegant build betrayed at least some kind of aelvish essence to the thing. Dressed in the same sickeningly ornate design as dark aelve soldiers, the armoured figure immediately portrayed its loyalties. And its hostilities. A few of the courtiers stumbled back, indeed, even the king struggled to maintain his illusion of calm control, a twitch breaking to his eye, his hold growing tighter still. Only the ambassador remained unfazed. The coiling, skin hugging plates of its black armor twisted and spiked like solid, un-moving dead flame, hints of deep, rich purple and cold, shimmering gold escaping from the cruel equipment. The face was masked behind a visor of the same equipment, the eyes invisible, and while a sword remained thankfully sheathed in embroidered leather, a wrist rested playfully on the engraved hilt, a gloved hand casually hanging in the air.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt began a slow careful walk towards the young woman and her farther, steps landing with the uncomfortable quiet chink of cold metal against stone, the noise seeming to down out the rest of the world in its malevolent simplicity. It glanced uninterested across the group, passing both the king and aelve without the slightest impression. Only she seemed to deserve a lasting examination beyond brief half-seconds, and even then, the faceless gaze of the cold metallic visor cut quickly to the next. A short shoulder cloak, a contrast of pure white silk, rustled slightly in the wind. The aelven ambassador\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly. It ceased perhaps fifteen paces from the group that had escaped the immolated husk of the royal palace. An arm moved gracefully to its back and the thing offered a humiliatingly perfect bow, the same way an actor might thank an audience. Its voice came clear and strong through the collapsing world around them, the words hosting an exotic, and almost intoxicating accent, yet the pronunciation was perfect, spoken by an educated, intelligent mind. It resonated somewhere deep inside her, as if echoing upwards within one\u2019s core, or spirit, the simple words laced with an almost undetectable, horrible, monstrous restraint.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cI am Witch Knight Hayt, General of the Third Solheim Army. I humbly request you agree to an immediate armistice and surrender yourself for peace talks.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\--\n\nI am looking for a partner to play the princess of an annexed kingdom in a fantasy roleplay. While the main story is relatively long, the key themes we will be exploring will be primarily character based, specifically, telling the story of a young woman, your character, finding her place in a harsh and unforgiving world as well as discovering truths and revelations about said world. But the weird and wonderful aspects of the setting will only come about much later in the story.\n\nI take a GM style of roleplaying, taking control of setting and most characters, providing a story which ultimately your character stars in. This allows you to experience the plot, meet new characters and learn about them as your own character does. It means I can continually surprise you with twists and offer fun clues and foreshadowing to ongoing mysteries. I will never speak for your character or describe their action. All that is on you. Its your character. I understand that this style is not for everyone, as there are some who enjoy plotting stories out beforehand, so no hard feelings if you aren\u2019t so keen. I dont mind so much what person you prefer writing in as long as you are good at it, but would like you to write in past tense.\n\nRomance is by no means a necessity for this role play, but it is always quite fun. I always think its best to wait and see what happens organically regardless.\n\nI normally write 150-500 a response, one or two responses a day. I don\u2019t expect a partner to match me out of obligation, but I would like at least over 100 words. A lot can be said about even the smallest of actions or sentences.\n\nI roleplay exclusively on discord.\n\nIf you have any questions, please ask in the comments below so others might read them. I'd really appreciate if you included a short writing sample in your message, as well as some information about yourself and the timezone you live in.\n\nI hope to hear from you soon.",

            "selftext": "Happy hello, roleplayers of Reddit! Whimsy here looking to jump into something new once again! I'm a very experienced roleplayer (coming up on 30 years! \\*panic\\*) and writer (I've been a journalist for six years, as well as an editor and English teacher) looking to tell some new stories with some new people!\n\nI've gotten a few responses to this ad over the past couple days, but a lot of them have fallen through for various reasons, so I'm hedging my bets a bit. I still believe the perfect partner(s) are out there!\n\nHere's what I'm looking for:\n\n* First and foremost, **I am looking for roleplayers who consider themselves** ***highly literate***. Actual years of experience doesn't really matter; I'm just looking for people who, at the very least, are comfortable enough with the language that they don't really bat an eye when considering simple things like sentence structure and punctuation. I don't want to sound elitist here, and I'm definitely not making a judgment call against people who struggle with their writing or even English in general, but for me, personally, if I have to squint and parse out every messy sentence, it really takes me out of an experience. That being said...\n* **Please be someone who takes pride in your writing**. One of my best RP partners to date made fairly frequent errors. But her writing in general was so interesting and compelling, and the stories we told together were so engrossing, that it just...didn't matter. So I would say that this is arguably more important than the prior point. Please be comfortable with good, strong, descriptive writing. Obviously you don't have to write a novel with every single post - in fact I'd prefer a blend of quality and quantity. The most important thing is having a good instinct on how long a post *needs* to be. A seven paragraph post that's all internal monologue and no description or action is just as boring as a one-liner.\n* **Please be available**. This one's a bit harder to set as a rule because obviously I get that everyone's schedules are different, and I will *always* understand that real life comes first. And *I'm* not always available either. But RPing is a very important part of my life and I tend to spend an inordinate amount of time on it. I don't expect everyone to feel the same way (though I tend to get along best with people who do), but I'd like someone for whom it is not a chore to devote at least a little time to it every day. With the caveat that yes I understand that stuff happens and we might need to be silent for awhile, I'd like someone who can comfortably post at least a couple times a day.\n* **I'm looking for something romantic -** probably slice of life, but the romance is what's really important to me right now. I'd like our characters to fall for each other, and for us to play through all the drama and emotions and conflict and joy and anger and everything else wonderful and horrible that that entails. I'm strongly leaning towards wanting something set in a high school or college setting, but if you come at me with something else, I might be game.\n* **I am trans and will be playing a trans character**. I don't think less of people who aren't comfortable RPing with a trans character, of course. I'm just putting this out here so you know what you're getting into. Trans-ness a very real source of drama in my life, and I *love* to play through that drama in my stories as well. I used to play a lot of genderswap scenarios as well and I really enjoy all of the drama that comes with a person's gender identity being swapped on its head, and the drama of how other people's perceptions of that character change at the same time. So please, only message me if you're comfortable with that (either a transgender character or a genderswapped one) taking a relatively central role (even if it's not center stage). We can discuss the specifics of it more in person (and I am more than happy to play with people who aren't knowledgeable about transgender issues but are interested to learn more!)\n* **I'm looking for a FxM pairing with me as the (trans) female.** Traditionally it's taken a *very* special partner for me to want to play opposite another female character, so I won't say I'm *not* open to it, but I'd strongly prefer you to play a male character.\n\nI'm sure there's more, but that's the basic jist of it. I'm not really as picky as I may seem with all of that humbug above, but I try to set the bar high so everyone will be happy in the end, so don't worry about me being an elitist or some kind of gatekeeping jerk. If you're reasonably comfortable with most of the bulletpoints above, I'm sure we'll get along just fine. :-)\n\nI do have an RP bio that I can send out for anyone who's looking to get to know me better, but it's incredibly wordy (big surprise after this jumble, right?) and no one should be subjected to reading *that* much just to see if they're compatible with someone! I'm just as happy to introduce myself in person, so go ahead and drop me a line here and we can discuss things further!\n\nThanks for getting through this mess and I look forward to meeting you!",

I prefer my RPs to have a bit of romance on them or sometimes even dedicating the story to it but I mainly do Slice of lifes taking place in a fantasy/Morden world. I am fine with dark and sensitive topics I always thought they spice RPs up a bit. I don't mind NSFW but I don't want it to be the main focus.

And here are some of the stuff that you should know if you\u2019re interested \n\n\u2022Genres I Roleplay: Practically everything. I typically like your typical Romance plots, with a bit of uniqueness to it. I will note that I\u2019m usually more comfortable doing romance with female characters. But I\u2019m willing to try something new. A particular favorite of mine though, would definitely be Action Adventure. I\u2019m open to ideas though\n\n\u2022My Specs: I\u2019m typically pretty literate. And I usually post in the 3 to 4 paragraph range; though I will occasionally do 1 or 2 depending on the situation \n\n\u2022What I expect from my RP partner:\n1\u2022 Please be 18+. I feel a bit uncomfortable at the prospect of playing with teenagers and younger. 2\u2022 I\u2019m known to occasionally procrastinate on RPs. So a patient reminder every now and again would be helpful.  3\u2022 I don\u2019t mind more saucy writing, though I don\u2019t want a pure smut RP.  4\u2022 I\u2019m fine with you playing a canon character, or an OC. \n\n\u2022Fandoms I\u2019m willing to Roleplay: One Piece, Full Metal Alchemist, JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure, DCAU, D&amp;D, Pathfinder, WWE, Age of Sigmar, Warhammer 40,000, Critical Role, Godzilla, MTG, Legend of Zelda. \n\n\nI\u2019d prefer to do the roleplay on Discord. To get my tag, please DM me here and I\u2019ll give it to you if I\u2019m interested in the RP",

I generally post a few paragraphs in each response, situation providing.\n\nFor this post in particular I am looking for fandom based roleplay. I'm open to most fandoms, so long as I know it, so don't be afraid to drop by with some suggestions of fandoms that you'd like to try. I prefer to roleplay with original characters, and am also like to do some world building should it be brought up. Otherwise we can simply work with the provided universe. Some of the fandoms I am open to are listed below, but this is by no means a comprehensive list.\n\nSoul Eater\n\nBNHA\n\nAttack on titan\n\nNaruto\n\nTokyo Ghoul\n\nHalo\n\nRWBY\n\nFire Emblem\n\nTo any interested, I hope to hear from you soon. Once more, if you don't see a fandom you'd like to try listed, just give it a mention to me and I'll let you know If that's one I know about/would be willing to try.

I usually do F x M, but I can play both genders and am happy with all pairings. My responses tend to be shorter at one to two paragraphs.

I play mostly as female roles since that's what I'm good at, I also write in the third person. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor genres, I like romance, action, drama, fantasy, adventure, mythology, sci-fi, slice of life. I would love to try horror, mystery, thriller. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm okay with fandom roleplays but I normally like the idea to be just set in the world of the fandom. Mostly because I don't wanna act out of character. But keep in mind I might not know/like a certain fandom. I won't be rude about it as long as you understand that and don't blow up on me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut fandoms I'm apart of is Diabolik Lovers, Subnautica, Starbound, Rimworld, Fallout (the game series), Skyrim, My Time At Portia, Amnesia (the anime), most studio ghibli movies, Fable (the game series),  Stardew Valley.

Since it's my favourite universe and I'm very knowledgeable, I'm still looking to this day :')  \nI firmly believe that if done properly, the settling is a wonderful playground for roleplayers of some ability - it's just a little challenging at first.\n\nI'm looking for writers who are already at least somewhat vaguely familiar with the universe, since there is a little too much to explain from scratch I'm afraid - although I won't turn you away if you're eager to learn :P\n\nPersonally, I enjoy detailed and long posts - I average several paragraphs and can go beyond to novella standard. However, I appreciate that in some situations, quick fire dialogue and action posts are more than welcome, when appropriate. \n\nI don't really have any plot ideas per se, I'd want to work something out that we both enjoy - however it is my favourite fandom so I do get inspired easily! :)  \nI especially enjoy romance, and I find romance in such a grim universe a very compelling idea! When it comes to romance, I can play both genders equally well (I like to think so anyway)\n\nI think that's all, I don't want to make this too much of a drag! Please do message me if interested! I don't particularly mind where we roleplay, but I'd most likely use Discord - although if that's not your thing that's fine of course!\n\nOnce again, please do message me if you're even slightly interested! That's all -   \nCiao :)\n\n(This is my first post here so I hope everything is up to scratch)",

An Experience.\"***\n\nIt is election season, and I think a bug bit me. \n\n**The Tale:** I am looking for a roleplay partner who would love to write with me a compelling story set in the backdrop of American politics today. I want something that would keep us on our toes, that would expand on our own interests in economy, politics, and everything that goes with it. I want to write a story that will be centered around characters finding their way to the most powerful seat in the world- and amidst all of this?  A romance one cannot simply describe, a romance full of passion that may be enough to commit a crime. \n\nI have a few plot ideas in mind, and of course would love to hear yours as well. I\u2019m also hoping I can find a partner who is willing to write more than once character if to help the story to move.\n\nYes, I am looking to create a story, not just one plot. Yes, we would have a main character each- but I\u2019m looking for a narrative that can open windows to more subplots and other supporting characters. I want us to write an entire world as far as our imagination and literary lust can take us. \n\nAre you with me? Can I count on your vote? ;)\n\nPM me if you are interested and we can talk further on Discord. \n\n**About Me:** I'm a female way above 25. I can play those in the late teens or early 20s, but not as mains. I'm in a very different mind space at the moment to have to go back to those times. Please note that I am looking for something with politics as the main focus. \n\n**About You:** Someone in the same age range who is okay with NSFW themes and is looking for a long-term partner. Someone who is excited to write a story like this together. One who writes with passion and excitement in this intimate journey that nurtures our creativity. Also one willing to have a relationship OOC, where we can make our own safe space- talking about our roleplay and other such things in life. When you contact me, kindly give me your favorite election year, just so I know you read all of this.\n\n*Caveats:* I only write heterosexual females, write in third person, I do prefer using face claims and creating brief but substantive character profiles.",

            "selftext": "Hey, everyone!\n\nRecently, I've been combing through multiple role-play themed subreddits, and I haven't really found a good cyberpunk prompt. I know it's definitely popular through different mediums, like books, games, and movies, but I've really been craving a grungy, sort of lowlife/high tech story I can sink my teeth into. So, since no one was coming forward, I've decided to GM a cyberpunk world of my own! I'm looking for 3-5 players, guys and girls! Here's a few things you can expect:  \n\n\n* **Adult Themes/NSFW.** So, everyone who wants to participate should be 18+. It definitely won't be dark unnecessarily, per say, but just realistic. Gritty. A good amount of opportunity for smut, for people who swing that way. \n* **Multi-Para.** I'll give you plenty info to work with, and while you definitely don't have to be long winded as me, I'm of the mindset that you write how much is needed. If an NPC is talking to you, you don't need to stretch out responses. On the same note, one lining every time its your turn to respond just makes the whole experience drag for everyone else. \n* **Frequent Responses.** Think this is the biggest reason these things fail. I roleplay primarily through Discord, and great RPs have just faded away because of slow responses. Now, I can promise I will respond frequently, and of course, I will always notify you if I have a busy day. I expect the same from whoever chooses to join.   \n\n\nAnyway, that's it from me. If that sounds appealing to you, PM me, and I'll give you my Discord ID and/or the server link. And if you have any questions, feel free to ask! Hope I see you guys soon!",

I am fine with dark and sensitive topics I always thought they spice RPs up a bit. I don't mind NSFW but I don't want it to be the main focus. If you are intrested at all give me a PM and we can discuss over discord.",

            "selftext": "Hello Folks! It's your friendly neighborhood RPer who has no friends and is looking for a consistent Role Play partner! I'll cut to the chase, cause you can get to know me later. After all, friendship is key to any good Role Play.\n\nWhat I'm looking for at the moment is someone who is willing to do a JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Role Play. I'm looking to craft a story between OCs and just have some fun. It doesn't have to be serious or super thought out or anything. However, I can still do that if need be. I'm just looking to have some fun RPing my favorite series of all time!\n\nI have about 5 years Role Play experience, and I usually type around 1-2 paragraphs per response. I have a fairly busy life, so some days I might not be able to respond while others I'll respond with in 5 minutes. I hope that you'll be willing to work with my crazy and unpredictable schedule. I'm also not afraid to shy away from NSFW themes, so I would hope you are fine with them as well. The only other request I have is your willing to just be chill, since I'd rather not have another thing to stress about. \n\nI plan on playing OCs with our own original stands, and I would expect the same of any possible RP partner. I'm not comfortable with RPing with or as cannon characters. Especially since I want to create our own entirely new story. I'm open to ideas as to what you would want as a story and I have a few ideas as well. Otherwise, just follow basics RP rules and we will be all good! (Metagaming, godmodding, etc)\n\nLastly, just a few warnings about myself. Just thought I'd get them out of the way now. \n\n- I usually take a GM/DM type Role due to my experience with dungeons and dragons. This isn't a nececarry, but just a preface in case your confused why I may seem to start to take control of a situation too much. Just tell me, and I'll gladly stop\n\n- I enjoy playing multiple characters. This is also another thing that I don't have to do, but I enjoy doing anyways. If your not comfortable with that, then it's no biggie to me\n\n- Combat and darker themes are things I include heavily in my stories. So, don't choose me if your looking for some wholesome cinnamon rolls \n\n- Lastly, Romance is not a strong suit of mine. I'll gladly do it and I'm not opposed to it, but I lack proper experience with it. However, I would gladly do some romance and would in fact encourage it. As long as it feels natural, of course.\n\nCongrats on actually reading this far! That must mean you actually somewhat want to RP with me. Right? Well, if you do, then feel free to message me. We can exchange discord info there and talk about what we want out of a RP. Also, as a gift for making it this far, I'll let you in on a little secret. I'm totally down for other kinds of RP as well. Just ask first and I'd be fine with doing other things as long as your nice about it. Thanks for reading!",

There is no discrimination. Mothers, brothers, sisters, and daughters. Those around you have seemed to accepted this as the new norm, but no one has been able to answer the most important of questions; why? Why are these innocence people being ripped from their lives? And by who? You and a small gang of villagers have decided enough is enough. It's time to find, and stop, whatever is behind these kidnappings. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \\-----  \n\nPSA: This is a REBOOT. The first time we didn't get very far before people dropped, so we're trying again! A couple of people who were actually invested will be carried over from the previous RP, but we will be starting completely over in the story. We also may be changing immediate events so that it's new for everyone, but we may not since we really didn't get far AT ALL (really no secrets were even spilled). I would like to emphasize that we are looking for DEDICATED roleplayers who can post pretty much EVERY DAY! I know that's a lot, so it might not apply to everyone, and that's OKAY! (If you miss a day here and there that's okay, I personally work and go to school on certain days and I might miss posting on one of those days sometimes, although I try not to) I understand people dropping happens, but it was like, 6-8 people, and that's a bit too many! So please, I ask that you don't express interest unless you think that you can keep up! Otherwise, we are super excited to welcome new people and try this again! \n\nHello!  A friend of mine and I having been roleplaying for 7-8 years, and we are wanting to start a new roleplay. This roleplay will have things happening around you beyond your control, but you will be allowed and encouraged to respond in any ways you want, and do anything you want, you simply may be met with situations at time you may not have been expecting.  We would prefer experienced RPers, who can write 1-2 paragraphs most of the time. We are both in EST, but we are not picky about what time zone you are in, as long as you can get up a post every day or every other day. (But preferably often, as I encourage roleplaying as often as people can post).  This roleplay will be held on discord. We will be DM'ing this roleplay (if that wasn't obvious). If you are interested, please comment or send me a message. Once we get 4-5 people, we will make the discord.",
