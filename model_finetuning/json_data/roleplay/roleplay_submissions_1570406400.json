            "selftext": "All is not actually well at Pandora Wellness &amp; Rehabilitation Facility.\n\nNot a single soul can see in. And not one single soul can see outside of those big, black gates. You can dream about it, sure. But you definitely can't even think about doing it. Because your hospital chip will sense that via your heart rate, way before you even think about making a move.\n\nPandora Wellness &amp; Rehabilitation Facility, most commonly used by the 'messed up rich kids', is essentially a 5* luxury hotel, featuring it's own state-of-the-art sports centre, latest spa treatments, world-class cuisine, and your own specialist doctors? Sounds like a once in a lifetime offer to change your life.\n\nWhich is exactly what that is. \n\nA lifetime offer.\n\nOnce you're in Pandora, the likelihood is that you will never return to your real home. \n\nOn the surface, it appears that all the residents of Pandora have an amazing life set up for them whilst they are there. The majority come from wealthy families \u2013 the few that don't are usually there on a 'gifted programme'. Their 'suites' are set up with materialistic things. They have personalised tuition, and they more often than not end up with a bunch of friends. Sounds great, right?\n\nWrong.\n\nPandora is filled with rules. Many, many rules. And if you're caught breaking a rule, it's not even worth your life. Punishments are given. They start simple, like no phone privileges, or no 'treat' with your evening meal. But they soon move on, to physical and emotional punishments. \n\nDoctor Huntley, known as Hunter amongst the patients \u2013 due to his predatory nature, is the main psychologist and the 'leader' of Pandora. Hunter uses his influence to control and intimidate not only the patients, but the staff also. Everything to do with Pandora is organised and controlled by Hunter.\n\nEverything.\n\nFood intake, daily exercise, water allowance, the books and movies they are allowed to have access to, the times they're allowed to do these things. Internet access is restricted to their own server, in which every social media website is blocked. Most internet searches are blocked. Pretty much the only thing you can do, is buy 'pre-approved' items from Pandora's official 'shopping page'. This features a small selection of books, movies, clothing items, sports equipment and stationary. And to be able to shop, you have to earn 'credits'. These can be earned by good behaviour, achieving targets, helping out when required and making all of your grades. These credits can also be put towards your spa treatments and a 'weekly treat', which you can choose from a low fat chocolate bar, or a bag of rice crisps.\n\nAll of these things are logged on the official Pandora 'bracelet'. Use that term loosely \u2013 it's not exactly a fashion accessory. It's more of a 'chip' combined with an Apple watch. Hunter, and all other staff members can see what's recorded on the chip. Daily weigh ins, your calorific intake and the exact food you've eaten. The time you took your medicines, the things you've purchased. Your sleeping hours, your restless hours. Your heart-rate. Your specific location at all times. It's all stored right in there. And what's not stored in your bracelet is all seen on security cameras. The place is littered with them. There's at least 200 cameras on site, even in the bathrooms. \n\nVery, very, very rarely patients can be taken outside of Pandora. Only to specialised appointments, or family visits. These are chaperoned by 3 staff to 1 patient, to reduce the risk of a 'runner'. \n\nSome patients have tried to break out. It's resulted in them being locked in 'Maxx'. The maximum security wards. Chained to a bed and tube fed. Mentally tortured with pictures, videos, sounds of things that scare them the most. Every once in a while, Hunter will do a 'visit' with all of the patients, to see those locked in Maxx. It's usually enough to scare anybody else from trying it. \n\nWill you try it?\n\n\n\nPlease send me a PM for a link if you\u2019re interested!",

            "selftext": "###Hogwarts 1890: Background Information/Brief History\nThe year is 1890. \n\nQueen Victoria's reign reaches the close of its fifty-third year, marking an era that many historians will later recount as peaceful and prosperous for the people of Great Britain, where technological advances usher forth an industrial revolution, allowing for a burgeoning middle class, while an empire expands its reach. But progress does not occur in a vacuum. To move forward, there must be change. Science, after all, has done much more than simply bring incredible new technology into the homes of everyday people. With it comes a new way of looking at the world - one based on observation and logic, rather than the ideology found within age-old traditions.\n\nIn the upper echelons of the Wizarding community, however, some members of the most elite bloodlines have dedicated themselves to the preservation of magic by enforcing edicts of their own in an effort to ensure the prosperity and safety of their world through the guarding of long held, highly prized customs for fear that their age of magic may be on its way out as a new century looms ahead.\n\n###Broad Plotlines\nGiven the time period and the subject matter of the fandom, there are a number of themes and plotlines that could be interesting to explore. These include, but are not limited to: \n\n- Tensions between the varying classes, as the Victorian age was a very classist society [upper, middle, lower] even among wizarding families. \n\n- The discrimination between pure-blood wizards vs. half-blood and muggle-born. While half-bloods of a higher class might be easier to accept among the Sacred 28, at this time there existed a lot of discrimination where wizards with muggle parentage were concerned. \n\n- Friendships/relationships formed despite (or possibly in spite of) differing classes and blood purity. \n\n- Feminism. The National Society for Women\u2019s Suffrage formed in 1872, for example, though all women over the age of 21 did not gain the right to vote until 1928 in the U.K. This was a time when women were still considered property of their fathers first, and then their husbands, for whom they would bear children and head a household. While it\u2019s true that some women did seek occupations, there were few that were proper to hold for a married woman (outside of the working class). \n\n###Roles and Storylines\nOur story will follow a group of Hogwarts students in their seventh and final year of their formal magical education - friends and foes alike. While the rest of your character\u2019s specifics will be left up to you, here are things to consider while formulating your character:\n\n- Family member of one of the Sacred 28 (pureblood):  Abbott, Avery, ~~Black~~, Bulstrode, Burke, Carrow, Crouch, Fawley, Flint, Gaunt, Greengrass, Lestrange, Longbottom, Macmillan, ~~Malfoy~~, Nott, Ollivander, Parkinson, Prewett, Rosier, Rowle, Selwyn, Shacklebolt, Shafiq, Slughorn, Travers, Weasley, Yaxley\n\n- Will they be a half-blood or a muggle-born?\n\n- What class will they belong to (upper, middle, lower)?\n\n- What Hogwarts house will they belong to: Slytherin, Ravenclaw, Griffindor, or Hufflepuff?\n\n- What are their plans after attending Hogwarts? Marriage? A Grand Tour? Finishing school?\n \n###Other Information\n- While the roleplay is not intended to be explicit at all, we feel more comfortable setting an age limit of 18+ for writers who would like to join the group. \n\n- Writers should use third person when posting. \n\n- Literacy is a must. Please have a firm grasp on the English language: spelling, grammar, etc. \n\n- No one-liners please. We are looking for detailed (paragraph at a minimum) posters who are detailed and offer partners plenty to respond to. \n\n###Thank You!\nIf you\u2019re still reading this, then thank you! I\u2019m a veteran roleplayer with a love of both historical fiction and Harry Potter and thought, \u201cWhy not join the two?\u201d This roleplay, while set in the same wizarding world created by J.K. Rowling, is meant to be considered an alternate universe, as events in our world will no doubt diverge from those in canon. As writers, we wanted to have the freedom to create and shape a world of our own rather than being forced to conform to known events in canon - this is why we chose to set our story so that it predates everything in the known Potterverse, including *Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them*, because it's always more fun if you don't already know how the story ends!\n\nIdeally, we are looking to create a small group of no more than 10 (possibly as many as 15 if the interest is there), so that we can keep the roleplay intimate. If you are interested in joining us on Discord, then please send me a PM with the following information: \n\n- A short introduction of yourself and why you\u2019re interested in the RP.\n\n- Information about the original character you would like to add to our story (there is no formal application process otherwise): name, age, Hogwarts house, blood status, social class, wand (wood, core, length), physical description/face claim, personality, a brief bio (please include any classes they excel in, or if they\u2019re involved in quidditch or other extra-curriculars), and any other facts/info about them that you feel would be pertinent. \n\n- A writing sample. (Feel free to link to a google doc or copy/paste previous roleplay posts; we just want to get an idea of your writing style.)\n\n- Any questions you may have. \n\nWe look forward to hearing from you!",

Maybe you'd seek adventure? Romance? Fantasy? Sci-fi? A little of all? The choice is yours!  \n\n\nHi! I'm a dedicated roleplayer of 7 years looking for my new long term partner. I enjoy creating complex, detailed worlds/settings with intriguing/gripping stories. I'm looking for someone who can rp for great lengths of time!  \n\n\nFor this rp, I have the idea of your character(s) having access to a magical library in which every book serves as a \"portal\" to another world. This rp is heavily based on CHOICES and what you decide to do will significantly impact how the rp progresses. If you build a strong relationship with a character from a \"book\", you will be allowed to take them into the \"real world\" and even have them accompany you to other worlds/books.  \n\n\nI have a few settings/ideas for how your character comes to find this library and have access to it. However, I'm totally open to suggestions and new ideas! Feel free to even create your own \"books\" or worlds to the rp!\n\nWhen I rp, that is the main thing I focus on. That way I can provide detailed and timely responses. I expect the same from my partner! I am open to NSFW themes and romance so long as it isn't rushed and makes sense with the story/plot. I like to use face claims/refrences but this isnt necessary. Personally, I will be playing a variety of characters. Eventually, depending on your choices, one of these characters will likely develop into my \"main character.\"  \n\n\nAlso, let's be friends! That makes the rp so much more enjoyable. :)",

            "selftext": "**Hey there stranger:**  \nI'm a male, 20+, who's been doing role-playing nearly as long as breathing. It's one of my favorite hobbies and lately I've been very lacking on being able to enjoy it. I'm looking for people passionate but patient, who are interested in fantasy-styled role-plays that may or may not be set in original worlds of our creation. These places may be akin to low-fantasy Hyboria or as fantastical as Azeroth, regardless fantasy is the *key*. I'm going to elaborate where I must and be brief where I can; this is probably one of the several dozens of ads you'll see today.\n\n**The Writer ( Me ):**\n\n* Is best considered a lazy literate, who can pump out everything from a single paragraph to multiple.\n* Has a job and real-life obligations and has them take priority over writing.\n* Has played every type of character and gender with their specialty and preference being *men* and *monsters*.\n* Is perfectly content with NSFW themes or actions that may occur.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What I'm Looking For:**\n\n* People interested in fantasy-based role-plays.\n* Interesting characters that are not defined so much by birth but by mind and actions.\n* Stories focused on the interaction and lives of the characters within and not so much grand calls to save the world or some take on *Star Crossed Lovers*.\n* Someone who is willing to add to the story and not just focus on their character, who is willing to breathe life into the world with passion and collaborate to make truly inspiring things.\n* Someone who doesn't mind at times a single post per day to the very minimum of one post every couple; this will be far in between but tolerance for this may be necessary.\n* Someone without triggers or very little; many of the themes I like to explore may be considered offensive or strange. While I may not support these things I do believe they add a particular flavor of making things interesting and curious.\n* A less focus on Romance on more upon dynamics; while I do not mind romantic themes if they are the sole-purpose of the pairing I do get kind of bored. However, *dark* romances are very much up my alley.\n* Original characters first and foremost. I do not care to do fandom and I really have little interest in them.\n* Character references in terms of artwork to be anime or artistic and not RL face-claims.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Familiar Settings:**\n\n* Elder Scrolls\n* Warcraft\n* Warhammer Fantasy &amp; 40k ( One of my few negotiable Sci-fi settings )\n* Monster Hunter\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**CYOA ( Choose Your Own Adventure ):**I've never been an official DM of a game with systems but I do not mind putting you through a free-form story where what happens is sparked by your character's actions. In this I'd play most of the NPCs and control the known world and be up to you to explore and choose what you wish your interactions to be! I do have a grand setting in my head that I usually pull from and many different types of characters you can encounter. Yours could aspire to rule a country, to own an Inn, or just adventure. There are many possibilities and if you're interested ask me about it and I'll elaborate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Cravings:**  \nThese are not required but they are things that I find strongly tempting to play around with. Some are very obvious and some are a bit more of a seed; ask and plug any you find interesting!\n\n* Cultural Assimilation\n* Cultural Differences\n* Cults and Secret Societies\n* Outlandish/Unexpected Pairings\n* Themes of Redemption and Corruption.\n* Eldritch Horrors and Themes\n* Power Dynamics\n* Non-Human Characters ( Drow, orcs, trolls, etc. )\n* People bringing their OC's into our/my worlds.\n\n**A Note on** ***Ideas***:  \nThe thing is, I do have plenty of them. Stories revolving around the rise and fall of empires, of great evils, of the search for a world-shattering weapon that can only be found in the dreams of someone that shouldn't exist; these things are pretty common to me. What I seek to fully bring any idea to life is an interesting character concept to run them through. Let's figure out what interests you, what you'd like to play, and I will gladly present ideas or concepts to entice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Contacting Me:**  \nBe friendly and inquire about anything on the list/come at me with an idea. Bring me a character you'd like to explore with or push interest of building a world and it's inhabitants together. What I want is simple, to create a tale of two characters and how it effects the world around them. Initial discussion will take place over Reddit private messages until we seem to be a good match and we'll move over to discord.\n\nUntil then, thanks for reading!",

I've always been fascinated by the mafia and the supernatural, so I thought it could be interesting to combine the two! I have a couple of friends on board, but I am super excited to bring in new people.\n\nThe world is still evolving, but I can tell you that the story takes place in modern times in a city not unlike Baltimore. The supernatural races like vampires, werewolves, shapeshifters, ghouls, and various minor races have evolved from small, secretive sects to full-on crime families. Many groups grew their numbers by turning humans, ie vampires and werewolves, but other families are just that. Families. While some groups have risen above crime to try and become a force of good, most races have kept to what they know; evil. The vampires rule the drug trade, werewolves make a living as gun runners, shapeshifters have dominated white collar crimes. The human public knows very little of this cryptid world, but they are aware that it exists.\n\nThe current climate involves a long-running war between two different families/races, but as the world is still being built those two races have yet to be determined. A small group of both human law enforcement and undercover members of other factions are trying to ease the tension before the city is ripped apart by death and destruction. Whatever side you are on is up to you.\n\nThe cliche races are the most common, but if you have lore that you would really like to play off of, then we can talk about it! Think playable races in D&amp;D. Angels and demons are off of the table for now.\n\nI would like to at least start on Discord for world-building and causal RP, but I am also going to be looking into forums for a more dedicated story platform.\n\nPlease message me if you are interested!",

As a student roleplay is one of the things that helps me relax and take my head off university BUT i really have a hard time keeping a roleplay going with my American friends with the time zone difference so today i want to look specifically for a Europian buddy. Now im not the most literate writer since my native tongue is not English so you have to be ok with the grammatical or spelling mistake every once in a while. \n\nGenres:\n1-Im a sucker for a good romance so if you happen to like those too would be nice.\n2-Fantasy is my main jam, a beautiful yet cruel world filled with beauty and dragons and all sorts of beasts is what i love.\n3-Time travel is also a very welcome subject for me especially if it\u2019s a mind bender.\n4-I love both anime and games so anything inspired from those two is absolutely welcome.\n5-I have a moderate experience building worlds if that is what you like then you can hit me up.\n\nThank you for reading and i really hope ill get some responses and hopefully soon some new friends :).",

            "selftext": "So, I'll make this as short and sweet as I can because I'm positive a lot of people know the drill and are tired of reading the same things over and over again.\u00a0\n\nHere's a quick list of what I'm looking for:\u00a0\n\n- someone comfortable playing a male main character.\u00a0\n- a roleplay written in the third person, past or present tense.\u00a0\n- a roleplay where smut content isn't a priority. I am not looking for gratuitous anything.\n- a partner who, like me, has a not-so secret soft spot for some form of romance in a roleplay.\u00a0\n- a partner who enjoys writing a few paragraphs per reply. I need that immersion and character thoughts; it's my favourite part about roleplaying.\n- for appearances, I'm comfortable with realistic or digital images so long as we both use the same media. I'm okay with descriptions as well!\n- happy to roleplay on gdocs or discord.\n\nThat's about it, I think. Here's a list of character ideas/plot bunnies I would like to play. I tend to stick with the standard apocalyptic, fantasy, medieval, modern, and/or any mix of those genres.\u00a0\n\n- A band of mercenaries is hired to hunt and capture the woman who assassinated the crown prince. She is one of the leaders from the notorious tribe of assassins roaming the jungle, and is rumoured to harness an unknown power. Early on their journey back to the kingdom, prize in tow, the mercenaries are ambushed by bandits. Come nightfall, one injured mercenary reluctantly accepts the help of their captive, and an unlikely friendship blossoms.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n- A Princess is crowned Queen after an assassination on her parents. With little experience and the threat of her own demise looming over her, she must learn to rule a kingdom while doing her best to stay afloat.\u00a0\n\n- A ship captain has her hands full when she runs into the country/kingdom's prince who eventually begs her to take him on her ship in a desperate attempt to escape\u00a0 an unwanted fate. [ happy to reverse the roles for this one ]\n\n- A human bartender who clocks into work nearly every night without knowing what's waiting for her during her shift. When you run a bar that hosts primarily supernatural creatures, there's never a dull moment.\u00a0\n\n- She's the type to spread her joy to other people, the kind of girl anyone would be lucky to take home to mom and dad. She moves into a new apartment complex, finally away from home, and immediately notices the odd habits of her next door neighbour. The late, unpredictable hours, the muffled discussions, the array of men and woman coming in and out of his house. In a gesture of good will, she bakes him a casserole and leaves it at his door with a note wishing him well. To everyone's surprise, her next door neighbour happens to be an important figure in a mob gang. What happens when two fundamentally different worlds crash together violently?\u00a0\n[ I'm feeling more romantic comedy on this one, but we can also have it be really serious ]\n\nAnyway, that's it for now. It would be great if any interested parties could message me with some sort of character(s) they would like to play. I've left these mostly open-ended as to leave some creative measures to my partners. I'm open to all ideas.\u00a0",

            "selftext": "Good day everybody! Today, as the title suggests, I'd love to play a psychopath against your therapist. So the general gist is as follows:\n\nHe is a psychopath. For a few years, people have been dying. No trace of the killer. Like in Seven, starring Kevin Spacey, they'd die in ways that suggest more crimes, even if their information showed nothing based on those murders. Eventually, he turned himself in, and confessed to the murders. Although aside from that, and a motive. He didn't say why. So he's arrested. He isn't a small man either. He stands at 6'5, and the body of a bodybuilder, with blonde hair and piercing emerald green eyes. The typical psychopathic genius tenancies. And she's his therapist. Maybe her first case? Maybe her first murderer.\n\nOr maybe he's just someone else on her list of killers. But the way they end up.. They're far more than just therapist and patient. After their many meetings, and her eventually getting him to open up, which in itself was a herculean effort. But the therapist ends up falling for him, and maybe he feels the same back... Then the rest is up to us.\n\nI hope you like the idea, I presume at some point. It'd get smutty between the two. Perhaps the therapist is currently in an awful relationship with a not very nice guy, and all it took was a mixture of her boyfriend's jealousy and the charm of a psychopath to send her into his arms.\n\nI am willing to play this on kik, reddit, discord. Whatever you have! I hope to talk to you soon! This usually gets quite a few people so don't be offended if I don't reply instantly!",

Good citizens of this fair town, I am Reynauld. A representative of the Black Iron Knights\u201d\nSeeing as civilians have begun to gather, he pauses a moment before continuing on. With some gusto, he points his hand to the piece of parchment he has with him. \n\u201cAs you may know, The Black Iron Knights have been on something of a recruitment drive as of late. I am here for that purpose as well. \u201c \nThe man\u2019s tone shifts for a moment, becoming a little less enthused. He was here in this backwater attempting to recruit? What drivel. Nevertheless, he continues on as the crowd around him gathers. \n\u201cWe of the Black Iron Knights wish to offer you good citizens a chance at service with our merry band! \u201c \nThe man lifts his arm up dramatically, as if to demonstrate his point. \n\u201cWe offer a substantial pay, travel and of course the opportunity to prove yourself in combat!\u201d \nThis man clearly enjoyed that part of his own rhetoric as he proudly slammed his fist against his armour, providing a satisfying *thump!* noise.  Having said that, it was quite evident this man was quite proficient in combat. The large great-sword on his back is almost as large as he is and covered in black stains. His amour was black in colour, a sign of respect within the Black Iron Knights. Looking around the crowd one final time the man smiled warmly opening his arms wide as if in a gesture of challenge. \n\u201cWell then, who wishes to join us?\u201d \n\n\n\n\nHi there! You can call me Recluse, instead of writing out what I wanted I just decided to write out a starter. If you\u2019d like to join the Black Iron Knights send me a starter on what your character is like and how they came to want to join the black iron knights. \nI\u2019m fine with playing multiple characters and am literate, so I\u2019m looking for partners around a few paragraph or novella style of responses. \nLooking forward to hearing from you! \n\n-Reclusive",

I'm seeking an RP partner who is up for potentially sticking around for the long run, and becoming friends while we're at it!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Plot:** I'm a sucker for romance plots set within crime dramas. The characters I have in mind are an FBI Agent couple that have to manage their relationship and families while solving crimes and dealing with the stress of the job. The more dangerous and life-threatening, the better!\n\nI want to play out how they meet, how they grew closer, how they work together and protect each other, and how they keep each other grounded during particularly dark times. I want to know how their high-risk/high-stress jobs get in the way of their relationship.\n\nI also want to plot out intricate and dangerous FBI cases - murderers, criminal organisations, terrorists, cults, throw them at me!\n\nTLDR: it will be equal parts thrilling crime and angsty/fluffy slice-of-life romance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Character Dynamic:** My female character is the daughter of a convicted serial killer - tons of plot potential there. You'll be playing her male partner who was once a rising agent, but now struggles with PTSD after traumatic experiences in the field. He is a canon character, but we can tweak him if you want to. They'll basically be each other's pillars of emotional support. I'm open to smut, but it should make sense story-wise.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nApart from the above, I also enjoy alternate universes, and taking elements from different shows/fandoms and working them into an original RP.\n\n**Fandoms Include:**\n\n* Movies - Inception, Pacific Rim, X-Men, The Dark Knight Trilogy, Interstellar, DC/Marvel\n* Television - Criminal Minds, Mindhunter, Sense8, The Following, Game of Thrones, Hannibal, The Blacklist, DC/Marvel\n* I've never written fantasy before but I do play Dungeons &amp; Dragons and I'm open to trying out the genre.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Small Print:**\n\n* I expect the RP to get dark and contain sex and violence, as such I would prefer my partners to be 18+, or better yet 21+.\n* Must have good grammar/spelling.\n* Open to any length, from texts to one-liners to paragraphs. I do best at 2-3 paras, I can do more but it depends on the muse.\n* We can write on Google Docs, Tumblr, and I've never done it on Discord but I'm willing to try.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHit me up if any of this sounds interesting to you!

            "selftext": " \n\nThe dirt hadn\u2019t been red in years. Centuries. No one alive had walked upon how it once was. Not to say it had been forgotten. That ill-fated first generation of colonials. The now near mythic terraforming corporations. The dust blasted data from long dead rovers. But that place, that world, was gone. Like Selene, now a sea of shimmering neon, like Aphrodite, now a temple paradise of luxury and life, the god of war had been made a home. Darkened red weakened to promising brown to taunting yellow to stoic orange. It remains a harsh place. The harshest of the lot. But there is air. There is water, if you know where to look. There is gravity. There was no need to establish a corporate a state there, Luna had already been claimed as that twilight libertarian playground of the ultra rich. The Venusian Parliament had its own issues, deciding to fully embrace its wealth inequality and elitism, reverting to an aristocratic oligarchy hauntingly similar to 19th century Britain. And the Earth Federation, the bloated king of the lot, had dismissed the planet as the failure that it was. A necessary experiment between the moon habitation project, and the staggering success of Venus. There was no grand colonisation wave. No dedicated federation support, just another office in New York dedicated to making sure the new settlements paid their tithes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInstead of private corporations or Federation colony ships came the runaways. The outlaws. The left-behind and the disillusioned. The desperate and the brave. They were the true mothers and fathers of Mars. There was little influence on that wild and untamed world. The Earth Federations cared little for the few hundred thousand hiding out in the landscape of searing dunes and vast canyons. Most became little more than subsistence farmers, despite the near barren nature of the soil, cultivating quiet, unassuming, harmless lives as towns grew up around them organically over the years. Land was cheap there, belonging to one or another ancient prospector company that couldn\u2019t wait to get rid of rights bought in more optimistic days. Serious investors would normally stick off-world, keeping to orbital and deep space habitats, but that didn\u2019t stop small firms and groups sensing gaps in market otherwise dominated by giants. Years later and some of the more green areas even had Venusian and Federation based establishments. Training camps for military personal. Prisons and light industry. Even boarding schools for Venusian nobles, supposedly offering the best university across space. It was rural. It was easy. It was slow. It was peaceful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo how had it come to this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMeteor storms had become a silent part of normalcy on Mars. It was easy to find places of the world unstained by the light pollution from megacities like Luna\u2019s Tranquillity and the unflooded slums on Earth, you just had to get in a car and drive. Once upon a time people gazed at falling stars in awe. On Mars, a falling star is a shattered ship. The organs of some tattered spacecraft torn to shreds in high orbit. Rebel or Federation, it didn\u2019t matter. A falling star was an escape pod with its re-entry mechanism fried, the, hopefully already dead, inhabitants boiling into mist. They were the un-retrieved shells of sons and daughters. They were the souls of the lost screaming: \u2018Look at me! Look at me!\u2019 for half seconds more as they fade eternal into the sky.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWas it the protest of \u201985? The rising taxation? The sweet nothings of old man Mihhailov? The innocent look in the eyes of his daughter? Certainly not with the Martian declaration of independence. Not with the founding of the Kingdom of Cydonia, not with the charter creating the United States of Mars. Not the repainting of the fleet, the Federation attack from Phobos, the battle of Fossae, the militia raids, the terror bombing of Austin back on Earth, the military draft on Venus, the Lagrange 2 colony disaster, the Hannibal City massacre. All that came later. The war started earlier. Much earlier. Perhaps it had always been going on. It certainly felt like it to the weathered Kalashnikov wielding Martian militia, the Venusian farm boys forced into the Federal Marine Corps, the Earth born fleet officers who gazed with bloodshot, sleepless eyes into the inky darkness. For the men and women whose blood turned Mars red again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\---\n\nI am looking for a partner to roleplay with me on discord for a gritty science fiction fantasy RP. The main story will revolve around a group of characters going through a great war/rebellion on the planet Mars. While set an unknown period of time in the future, I do not want the focus of this RP to be technological advancement. Rather, the main theme would be exploring how human culture and society changes over time, the idea of nation states, with a focus on characterisation. I also imagine there to be some similarities to the American war of Independence. This is not strictly by design, but it might be an interesting aspect. Also, please understand, not everything will be set on Mars. Ive put great thought into the atmosphere and feel of the places ive mentioned/alluded to in this starter and all of them would be interesting to go into with more depth. That includes the eternally night time city of Tranquillity on the moon: a corporate cyberpunk dystopia, the authoritarian hypocrisies of Venus: a beautiful planet of life filled crystal seas and sun baked archipelagos, as well as the remains of old Earth, her scarred environment showing both the wounds we have inflicted upon her, and the damage she has caused us.\n\nI got this idea from the story \u2018The Beguiled\u2019, about a Union soldier imprisoned and nursed back to health in a Confederate boarding school. It sort of spiralled out from there into something much bigger.\n\nI\u2019d like you to play a character who is initially unfamiliar with Mars and swept up into the conflict. I think a noblewoman attending one of the above mentioned Venusian boarding schools would be a very fun role and it works with how I initially imagined the roleplay, but there are other ideas that could be really interesting, which we can talk about together in more depth.\n\nI take a GM style of roleplaying, taking control of setting and most characters, providing a story which ultimately your character stars in. This allows you to experience the plot, meet new characters and learn about them as your own character does. It means I can continually surprise you with twists and offer fun clues and foreshadowing to ongoing mysteries. I will never speak for your character or describe their action. All that is on you. Its your character. I understand that this style is not for everyone, as there are some who enjoy plotting stories out beforehand, so no hard feelings if you aren\u2019t so keen. I would like you to write in either 1st, or 3rd person past tense. I roleplay exclusively on discord\n\nI think that romance should be a large part of a story like this. Love is probably the most positive human thing we have and I\u2019d expect it to feature in this RP which will also explore some of the most negative things about us. That said, I don\u2019t much care which characters fall in love with each other and indeed, I don\u2019t plan anything on it. Anyone could be paired with anyone. We will see what organically occurs through writing.\n\nI normally write 150-500 a response, one or two responses a day. I don\u2019t expect a partner to match me out of obligation, but I would like at least over 100 words. A lot can be said about even the smallest of actions or sentences.\n\nIf you have any questions, please ask in the comments below so others might read them.\n\nI hope to hear from you soon. Please include a writing sample, messages without one will not be replied to.",

The main theme I like to play is romance but we can also add different elements into it if you wish. Please note though, fantasy is a big no! I would really appreciate it if you were reliable, and tell me if it got boring because then it's fair. If you ghost me, don\u2019t expect a sudden second chance. Of course we will both have our own personal lives but I\u2019ll always communicate healthily and let you know when I\u2019m busy. If you're going to message, be serious about this too and have a clear idea about what you want. I can do first or third person, I can change my preference if needs to be. Honestly, I will NOT accept one liners nor will I respond back to you if you're just gonna ghost. I've had enough of people just coming along for short-term purposes when this is LONG term. I cannot stress that enough.\n\nMy list:\n\n\\~Friends from childhood.\n\n\\~Roommates.\n\n\\~Nurse and Solider/veteran.\n\n\\~Prince/Princess falls for a village girl/boy.\n\n\\~Friends with benefits.\n\n\\~Rich Entrepreneur and interior designer.\n\n\\~Gang member and innocent girl.\n\n\\~Strangers.\n\nAnd of course, any other ideas you wish to tell me about. Yes I know these are mildly clich\u00e8, so I\u2019m willing to spice them up and add a lot more angst, or even some dark themes if it does fit with the idea. \n\nSmut will have a very small element in this, but it won't be too overpowering as I want to enjoy the story at its fullest - so it will be discussed fully once the plot has been established and there will always be a good build-up before any NSFW. When it happens though, I'll make sure to attend to your every need. I cannot stress this enough; Please be literate! (more than a paragraph at least). If you deliver on that, I will too. Roleplay is a two way mutual thing and it has to flow in order to keep a story going. \n\nThanks for reading! I use Reddit and kik. If you have any other platform, I\u2019ll be sure to download it if I can but I really do prefer the two I\u2019ve mentioned.",

All those who had fought for goodness and light were invited by the fairy king to a grand banquet and dance to be held in the land of the fey. The most powerful nobles and royals came from all over, intrigued by the pageantry of the event as much as by the possibility of working out new treaties. The most powerful humans, elves, dwarves, and dragons picked out their finest clothes and made their various ways through the looking glass to the fairy king's halls. (Your character is among them, a princess or high lady of the fantasy race of your choice.)\n\nOn the third day of feasting, a somewhat drunken fairy knight (my character) put on his armor and mounted his horse before riding into the grand hall. There he cried out in a loud voice, \"Is there a knight among you that believes they can beat me at the list?\" He raised his lance into the air, and enjoyed the attention of the crowd. \"I have been granted a single wish from the fairy king, and wish to use it to make a wager. Whichever one of us wins at the joust will win any prize at all that my charger can name.\" He sat there, eagerly awaiting a reply.\n\n((Two suggestions for your character:\n\nA knight who has a wish of her own.\n\nA princess in some important kingdom. A man that she detests stands and says that he wishes she were desperately in love with him. \"Very well. Let her love the winner of our contest with all her heart.\"\n\nReally any other interesting thing you can come up with would be fun.))",

I have been writing for 13+ years and it's a huge stress reliever for me.  But I also am a student, I work, I'm married and have a social life.  I will be long term, but I won't be able to post everyday.\n\nI write multiple paragraphs/novella and third person style, generally anywhere from 200 to 1000 words.  You don't ever have to match my length.  I am totally unconcerned with post length, just give me quality content.  I like action and moving the plot along, but I also love exploring characters thoughts and feelings in the moment.\n\nI am looking for M/F or F// pairings.  I thoroughly enjoy playing multiple main characters and my happy place is when we have two M/F pairings and I can play a male and female.  But as long as I can play at least one female in a M/F or F// romance, I'm content.  I like romance and am okay with smut as long as there is plot development to go along with it.  I also love other genres with my romance, like action, horror, drama, sci-fi, slice of life, etc.\n\nIf we use face claims, I prefer real life.  Otherwise, descriptions are just fine by me.  I can use discord or google docs.\n\nIf you contact me, please tell me a little bit about yourself and what you're looking for.\n\n# Roleplay Stuff\n\nThings/scenarios I want to write about:\n\n* Marvel OC's\n* Hitmen\n* Detectives/Serial Killers\n* Murder mysteries\n* Escorts and clients\n* Mafia/gangs\n* Hired bodyguards\n* Organized crime\n* Spies\n* Superheroes/vigilantes\n* Paranormal skeptics and believers\n* Doctors/nurses\n* College professors\n* Fulfilling a prophecy\n* Moving to a new country\n* Living life on the run\n* Harboring a fugitive\n* Werewolves and vampires in modern settings\n* Dystopias\n* Cyberpunk\n* Anything slice of life (I'm a sucker for slice of life)\n\nCharacters I already have posts for:\n\n* Escort/trust fund baby (F)\n* Drug dealer's daughter (F)\n* Journalist (F)\n* Nurse (F)\n* Medical examiner (F)\n* Werewolf (F)\n* Mutant (F) (Marvel OC)\n* Human paired against werewolf (F)\n* Alien (M) (Marvel OC)\n* Narcotics detective (M)\n* Homicide detective (M)\n* Undercover spy (M)\n* Werewolf (M)",

I have no idea. Before I get into the nitty gritty, allow me to say a bit about myself. I'm a 20-something male with plenty of writing experience, about 6ish years or so. I'm the kind of guy who (proudly) sprouts absurd and out there ideas, literally just on a whim or the slightest bit of inspiration. Seriously. Sometimes I can get a little crazy. My post length is anywhere between 1-3 paragraphs, but I came definitely get more out if I'm feeling inspired.  I'm also, for whom it might concern, in the central timezone of the United States. That being said, I have a horrid sleep schedule, so I'll usually be up pretty late into the night.\n\n\nWith that out of the way, let me say what I'm looking for. I am (unsurprisingly) looking for a female partner to nerd out with, 18+ of course, just in case we *do* go down a NSFW road at some point (It's welcome, but I'd like to not to be the focus of anything). **I will not, under any circumstances, write with someone under the age of 18**. I'm not comfortable with it, and I'm sorry if someone out there disagrees with this. Additionally, I'm looking for someone that I can call my friend. All proper and business is boring. I like to freak out with my writing partners. Come up with dumb plotlines or AUs. If you're looking for something strictly professional, I'm probably not your guy.\n\n\n\nFinally, we get down to what I'm *really* gonna be vague on. As you might've guessed by the title, I'm looking for something fantasy related. What specifically, you might ask? I have no clue. I'm a sucker for romance plots, with an epic adventure hanging above our characters' head. Be it slaying gods, or sealing away an ancient evil, I can't get enough of it. I love all sorts of different fantasy races, too. Elves? Oh yeah. Demons? Sure! Any kind of Yokai? *my god, that'll press my buttons in juuust the right way*. That being said, anyone that brings an idea with **Kitsune** as a major emphasis will make me *very* happy. Anyway. If you have any existing ideas, please, throw them at me! I love reading through plots n ideas. Want to create something new? We can chat for a bit, and see what we both like.\n\n\nI'm rambling now, aren't I? I think I've gone on for long enough. If I've caught your eye, please, shoot me a message, and I'll get to you ASAP. I get a lot of messages, so I'm sorry if I don't get to you right away. Some messages also slip through the cracks, or don't follow a certain obvious rule, so sorry on that regard as well. Just be sure to include your favorite color in your title, so I know you got down this far. I won't respond without it, because I don't enjoy it when people don't read my post. Like I said, I'm usually around into the late hours of the night, so you'll likely catch me. Thanks for reading!\n\n\n(Oh, by the way, don't send me a message only saying \"hey I think we can work something out\" or the like. Tell me about yourself, have some energy. Those kind of intros give me life)",

            "selftext": "It has been 3 years since the accession of Prince Noah IV, now 21 years old, to the throne. He was only 9 when his father the king was assassinated, and what followed was a long and bloody civil war over who had the right to rule. Uncles, cousins, and ambitious generals all scrambled for a piece of the royal pie, and many innocent lives across the land of Nod were lost in the struggle. The loyalist forces won out, and held a tenuous regency until young Noah came of age. Upon his 18th birthday, he was crowned new ruler of the land of Nod, and the people sighed in relief to have a king again after years of chaos and misery.\n\nNoah was an intimidating lad, tall and slim with dark brows and an intense gaze. He dressed himself in simple black or red robes, and avoided wearing the royal crown whenever he could. He was almost always serious, and rarely laughed or drank. Growing up in a culture of violence, he became hardened to the sight of death. And moreover, he's aggressive, impulsive, and passionate. He's strict about his personal code of honor, which often seems to conflict with the demands of kingship.\n\nDuring his 3 years as ruler, he has not been shy about carrying out his will. He made plans to expand westward, as his father had done, and soon began sending armies to capture towns and villages. He has often railed against the noble families of Nod for their decadence and luxury. But thankfully, he surrounds himself with powerful advisors who keep him in check. During this time, Noah has taken no wife, and hasn't shown much interest in women at all, instead putting all his energies and ambitions into politics. He sneers at the idea of love. But will someone manage to ensnare him as no one has before?\n\n***\n\nHello! Thanks for reading my little intro. So basically, I'm looking to play as this prince character, who's inspired by figures like Alexander the Great. Since he's younger, his personality will be conflicted and impressionable, but incredibly passionate. Think Prince Zuko from A:TLA or Kylo Ren from Star Wars. I'm mostly looking for a romance RP.\n\nBut of course, it would be an unusual romance. Noah is passionate about everything, and while it takes a lot for him to fall in love, he gets absolutely head-over-heels crazy when he does. He'd be the type to write (really bad) poetry for you and recite it in front of the kingdom, throw a hundred feast days in your name, and if necessary, die for you. But he still has huge political ambitions, and wouldn't toss them away for love. For example, if he fell for a low-ranking maid, he would try to keep the whole affair secret, because he knows it would be a public scandal. He would only ever marry for diplomatic purposes, but would try to keep the woman he really loves as, well, a side piece. Would your character put up with that? That's something I want to explore!\n\nWho will your character be? The aforementioned castle maid? An older noblewoman who shapes and manipulates him? A princess caught in an arranged marriage? A diplomat for one of the kingdoms Noah is trying to conquer? A high-ranking general? An adventurer simply passing through the kingdom? It's up to you! I like interesting and unique character dynamics, and hope we can develop some neat characters here. That's what will shape the direction the roleplay goes in.\n\nThis would take place in a fantasy setting, so I'm open to nonhuman characters. But I think Noah would probably have a prejudice against nonhumans. Yeah, he's flawed and unlikable in a lot of ways, but I hope that adds a bit of realism to our RP. Post length isn't a big deal to me - I can vary from one paragraph to a bunch, depending on what's needed. And that's about all I've got! I'd like to hear your thoughts and ideas, and we can work out the details over PM. Hope to hear from y'all!",

            "selftext": "Hello to all of you lovely lurkers and fellow roleplay subreddit subscribers! I\u2019m back again with another post because I\u2019m currently looking for some new partners! Autumn is upon us and the days are growing colder. It is officially the best time for curling up with a cup of hot coffee and writing a good story.\n\nBefore I explain some the idea I have in mind, let me elaborate a little bit on myself. I\u2019m a 22 year old female who enjoys playing both genders and in most cases can write multiple characters as well. I prefer to write MxF stories but will consider other pairings if the story warrants it. The only thing I\u2019m not flexible on is literacy. I write in 3rd person, past tense, and expect my partners to enjoy adhering to the same. As far as length goes, I average anywhere from 4-6 paragraphs but am capable of doing much more when the situation warrants it. These \u201crequirements\u201d are just to ensure we are as compatible as possible.\n\nWith that out of the way, let me describe my prompt! Since Halloween is on the horizon and horror stories are in season, I have been looking for a new story with all of the elements of fear and love that truly make those time of the year so magical! \n\nMy idea is simple but has a few twists that we can flesh out more depending on your tastes. I would love to play out a story around a cult in the early-late 1970\u2019s. This cult would be less centered around the idealism of Manson family style *Summer of Love* cults and more like what you saw in the movies **Bad Times at the El Royale** or **The Endless**. Alien/supernatural worship and strange events galore!\n\nThe most fun part about this in my eyes is the potential for twisted dynamics! Are you the charismatic leader? Are you the enigmatic newest potential follower? Are you the leader\u2019s most devoted and brainwashed follower? There is plenty of room for our mutual interests to blend together and create something truly unique. \n\n**(This story also has a great chance of eventually getting dark and/or extremely NSFW. I don\u2019t indulge in pure smut and it will never be out of character, but this is your warning of intent.)**\n\nIf you\u2019ve gotten this far, thank you! I hope that you\u2019re as enticed by this rough draft of a prompt as I am. I look forward to seeing an orange envelop from you in the near future. \n\nCiao!",

I don't care if you prefer to write in past. The only thing I'm firm on is that I have zero interest in writing first person.\n\n\u21b3 don't expect wildly long or frequent responses. I try to match length, but tend towards an average of a few hundred words. My schedule varies in how free I am (and also my mental health has its highs and lows), so sometimes I can give multiple daily replies, sometimes it'll be a few over the course of a week. Keen as I might be to progress an rp at times, I do my best to never pressure a partner to write. If you decide you're not interested in anymore or need a break, that's absolutely no problem. Just gotta say it, and cool, I getcha. I like roleplaying to be low stress.\n\n\u21b3 have preferences on ships, but to keep this post from rambling on forever, I'll just list fandoms I would like to write for below. If one is to your tastes, feel free to message me with your preferred ships. I live a multishipping life.\n\nFandoms I am interested in: [no order of preference]\n\n\u21b3 Persona (2, 3, 4, 5)\n\n\u21b3 Fire Emblem (Genealogy, Awakening, Fates, Three Houses)\n\n\u21b3 Dragon Age (Origins, 2, Inquisition)\n\n\u21b3 Final Fantasy (VII, VIII, XV)\n\n\u21b3 Fate series (/Grand Order, /Zero, /Extra)\n\n\u21b3 Re:zero\n\n\u21b3 Boku no Hero Academia\n\n\u21b3 Yugioh (DM, GX, 5d's, Zexal, Arc V, Vrains)\n\nAs I tend to be on mobile, it's much more convenient for me if you can direct message me over sending a chat.

Maybe you knew me, even. Maybe not.\n\nI usually write in first person past tense (I looked at her, she looked at me, etc), and I'd prefer if you did, too. I might consider third person if you ask very nicely, but it's a rare occasion that I'll do it.\n\nI consider myself 'literate', and can write several paragraphs per post or reply or whatever. Though length does vary, I prefer to keep things at 3-5 per pop, so events can keep moving swiftly, and we don't get bogged down in unnecessary filler details that do nothing whatsoever to drive the plot along. Sometimes I might write a shorter amount, depending on energy levels or whatever, but I'm usually pretty consistent.\n\nI'm willing to give most genres a go, but I prefer slice of life stuff, modern day fantasy, historical fantasy, Victorian fantasy, science fiction (see a pattern here?), pretty much any kind of fantasy. Low or high doesn't matter, but I prefer things to be in some way not the norm at all, even if it might seem normal for the characters.\n\nSpeaking of, I prefer to play my own gender, but I can play female if it's necessary to the plot; if I do play female, I'd prefer us both to be playing that. I don't do mxm at all. I prefer to focus on two characters, bringing in others when needed, but I'm open to other alternative ideas too.\n\nI prefer the slow-burn romantic kinds of plots, with lots of character development, gratuitous adorableness, and lashings of angst and emotional turmoil. I'm not a huge fan of gore for gore's sake, or sex for sex's sake, but if it makes sense in context, I'm all for it.\n\nI have a few ideas floating round, and some more in my head that haven't yet been written anywhere. At the moment, I've got a few everyday ideas, a couple or three involving people with superpowers, a couple of Fantasy things, and some miscellaneous stuff, too.\n\nI'm around most of the time- though I am in GMT, so please bear that in mind, and can reply pretty regularly, and will attempt to match whatever I'm given in terms of quality, length, etc.\n\nI prefer to use Discord or something similar, Please don't send me messages on Reddit chat- I don't use it, and I will totally miss your messages.\n\nI look forward to hearing from whoever this might interest!",

            "selftext": "I just want to thank this server as well as the people who I met and rped with. I\u2019m feeling a bit of nostalgia when I first came here, lonely and wanting friends and wanting to write with friends.\n\nI got what I wanted and so much more. I learned my way of loving someone and what I did to destroy that. I was a terrible friend and my once loving friend became untrusting of me.\n\nI understand. I\u2019m sorry.\n\nI wish I could have been a better friend and that I was stable as I am feeling now. It was hard at first, I\u2019ve never experienced heartbreak before. I never experienced losing friends the way I did. I miss you and that\u2019s ok. \n\nI\u2019m feeling wistful and at peace with my loss. I\u2019m still bitter and that\u2019s ok; I\u2019ve always been good at letting things go (maybe not since I\u2019m writing this haha). I love you, stranger, platonic love. For me that is the most love I can give.\n\nI learned a lot from our friendship, a lot of things not to do actually haha. I never had friends I connected so well with. You and yours are good people, some of the best. \n\nI\u2019m blathering haha. You know I\u2019m a talker. It was one thing that annoyed you. Sorry for being so annoying. I didn\u2019t know how to take a clue.\n\nAnyways, if you\u2019ve gotten this far, wow. I\u2019m surprised. Thank you. \n\nThank you for all the times you helped me. Thank you for all the times you were there for me. Thank you for talking to me and rping with me. Thank you for breaking my heart. \n\nI needed it. I needed to feel this. I would have never learned to be a better person without it. Thank you, you and yours.\n\nProtect your island. Forget about me. I will not, but that\u2019s because I want to keep the good and bad with me. I learned so much. \n\nSorry for the length haha, you will probably never read this. And that\u2019s ok.\n\n**To everyone else**, don\u2019t be so close to your rp partners. I got too close and I was burned like Icarus and the sun. They are what they are, just lost, lonely people on the Internet. Please protect your mental health and stay away from giving your heart away. I gave mine away and got it back shattered but I\u2019ve learned to put it back together. It is more beautiful than it was before. \n\nI will delete my account and go on to the real world. I\u2019m letting you go. You and yours, the best.\n\nRia",

            "selftext": " \nWith everyone\u2019s favorite manga on a break this week, it\u2019s just impossible to get your weekly dose of the One Piece world\u2026 Or is it?\n#StrawHatRPG: An Open World Roleplay Community\nWelcome to StrawHatRPG, the **oldest ongoing One Piece Roleplay Subreddit**. We are an alternate universe set in the rules of the One Piece World but without any of the canon characters, entirely new locations and a few familiar ones. The next generation of pirates have begun making waves in the Grand Line and we have a huge active player base at the moment, so it\u2019s a great time for you to join us!\nBlowing the cover off his secretive plan, our pirates managed to bring down the big bad wolf themselves, battling a formidable array of foes in the process.   \nNow as we sail on, a new island emerges on the horizon. Kiboshima, an native inhabited island where the marines are in search of a relic shrouded in mystery.  Curious to find out? Then now's the perfect opportunity for you to make a new start! A spark ignites a blazing flame in the hearts of the next era of Pirates. Come join us on a brand new adventure and immerse yourself in the stunning world of One Piece!\n***\nOur goal here at the sub is to be a story-driven, pseudo-linear RPG. Similar to the One Piece Manga, we continually journey forward from island to island. The island is completely open-world, meaning you can go where you like. This means you can explore, investigate, rabble-rouse, pick fights, get drunk, lay on the beach, train, or anything else you can think of! There will be events that players can participate in, or simply do their own thing, making up their own mini-story. Besides this, each island will also have a main story, open to all of the players.\nWe encourage **creativity and individualism** and will try and help facilitate that as much as we can (while keeping in mind the themes, and tone of One Piece, and the sub). Players have various different options to customize their characters such as **Custom Devil fruits**, Abilities like **Diable Jambe or Asura** that are unique to their character, etc. Players can also choose to **play as any race** from the world of One Piece or they can even combine races to get the best of both worlds! In fact, players can even makeup and moderate their own mini-island stories!\nIf all of these seem daunting, don\u2019t worry. We\u2019ve simplified the rules into easily digestible docs so that anyone can easily get started. Between our experienced mod team and **super friendly and helpful community**, you won\u2019t have any trouble finding all the help you need. We\u2019ve also taken into account all the feedback we\u2019ve received and constructed **Brand New and Improved Systems**. And if you\u2019re worried about lagging back behind older players, there\u2019s no cause for worry at all. With our catch up system, new players will get stats quicker than those at the top allowing them to close the gap at a steady pace.\n***\nCome on over to our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/7m7zcwc) to talk with other players, get advice from the mods, discuss the sub, or just chat! Everyone is friendly and loves to talk about any subject imaginable! It's a great place to just connect to other One Piece fans if nothing else!\nWell, what are you waiting for?[Dive right in into the adventure of your lifetime!](https://www.reddit.com/r/StrawHatRPG/comments/cf4nb9/welcome_and_guidelines/)",

So I'm asking you good people to help me, roleplay out some content for them if we can see eye to eye on any of our ships\n\nI have a prompt for the idea that inspired the post but other than that I'll just list some of me big ships or things with lots of characters I ship together. It's persona 5 based by the way.\n\n\n\n\"Lady Ann you told me we were going to get sushi and I know for a fact this is not the way to the sushi place.\" Morgana grumbled before suddenly perking \"could it be that you want to confess your love to me!?\"\n\n\"What? No of course not.\" Ann said giving the cat a strange look, \"I wanted to ask you something without anyone hearing.\" She says quickly looking around to ensure there's no one around to hear her. \"So as phantom thieves you describe what we do as stealing hearts right?\"\n\n\"Yeah, but we don't actually take a physical heart out of their body.\"\n\n\"Yeah but it's about desires and stuff, so could someone\" Ann paused for a moment thinking of how to say this \"theoretically use her phantom thief abilities to steal the heart of her best friend, let's call her chiho in the traditional sense. Like make the friend fall in love with them? Like is chiho has moved away and I-\" Ann quickly corrects herself \"iana, let's call our phantom theif, really misses sh-... Chiho and wants her to move back home with her at her new place could our theoretical phantom thief plant desires on someone's shadow to influence them to feel a certain way?\"\n\n\"Where are you going with this lady Ann, I have to say it's very suspicious. Besides even in that case it would probably require this best friend to have a palace.\"\n\n\"So you're saying it might be possible?\"\n\nSo yeah it's a bit short but the point is I really want to do some Ann X Shiho roleplay that's the big ship I like, but am totally down to do other prompts involving them, or do other characters\n\n\nSo  if that doesn't strike your fantasy I would also like to do some, ryuji X joker, I have lots of danganronpa shippings I like, and lots more that I'm totally blanking out on",

I seem to be a little short on roleplay partners as of recently, so here comes my rather vast search! \n\nSo, as I said, I'm an F her prefers to play her gender - I'm most comfortable with doing FxM, but I can be swayed with a good plot!\n\nI'll keep this short and sweet to reel in those writers. I usually write 3-5 paragraphs near the beginning, though I slim it down to 1-3 after that. I am not a serious novella writer - I write for fun! Though, I do try to keep mistakes to a minimum and prefer writing on the more detailed side. I may write for fun, though fun for me is at least some literacy. I also prefer someone who can manage at least somewhat quick replies!\n\nI love gushing about our characters, making art for them, and making wacky headcanons and AUs. Since I do art, most if not all of my faceclaims will be my art! I prefer either descriptions or art of your characters, as well! The art doesn't have to be yours, just cause I make my own art for my characters doesn't mean you have to!\n\nI enjoy all sorts of genres (I'm not good at writing action sequences, though). I prefer for there to be a romance involved in our plot, since it adds drama! I don't shy away from NSFW and I don't have any limits - well, anything that isn't overtly disgusting is fine with me.\n\nSome of the fandoms I'm into include but are not limited to Red Dead Redemption 2, Rain World, Marvel, No Man's Sky, OverWatch, The SCP Foundation, and maybe more?\n\nDM me and I can give you my Discord tag! Please include a bit about yourself in the DM, I like learning about people!\n\nNow, for a few short descriptions of plots!\n\n-\n\nA modern woman is transferred to the western era in a blinding flash of light - she doesn't know how she got there, and a 'cowboy' freaks the heck out.\n\n-\n\nTwo people leave on the first space craft capable of traveling through hyperspace, however Earth mysteriously explodes once they leave the familiar planet.\n\n-\n\nSomething modern to do with the 1930's. I've been reading To Kill a Mockingbird in my spare time and Atticus absolutely melts my heart\n\n-\n\nWe don't have to do these plots, these are just some I've come up with. That's all, folks!",

It takes place on a huge capital ship during a war that has been spanning for a hundred years against a seemingly limitless enemy that has been coming through via wormholes. \n\nThe story revolves around the captain and a few key members of the command crew. It explores the mental health and the toll that it takes on one who has been fighting their whole lives, and the relationships that form because of it. \n\nIf these seems like something you would be interested in, send me a PM and we can discuss more about it.",

I thought by creating and designing cute OCs but barely enough to design what they\u2019d be like, personality wise. \nThat\u2019s why Roleplaying comes into play. I want to share my characters with others. To help me be creative and breathe life into my characters. \n\nIt sounds silly I know, but I thought it would be a good idea to put an ad here. To find someone with a like mind, and creativity to get together. \n\nI\u2019m alright with NSFW themes, just not the too weird things of that side. Call me old fashion. \nAs for themes in general. I like supernatural themes, Slice of life, high fantasy( like DND), or horror.\nPairing wise: I can do M/F, F/F, and M/M. I have so many characters to fit any fancy you may like. \nI can not RP as canon characters, I don\u2019t watch a lot of anime/Tv shows and just makes me uncomfortable. \n\nAs to what I expect from my partners... well I'm not asking for much just to follow the basic rules of etiquette:\n\nWhen I ask you what type of RP me you would like to do. Dont just go:\n 'idk.' \nWell then why did you seek me out in the first place?? At least have a basic idea of what youd want and we can bounce ideas back and forth. \n\nI'm immediately going to be turned off if you want nothing but Smut. My characters are like my own kids and they're not for you to satisfy an 'itch'. At least let there be some kind of plot and development between our characters. \n\nTell me what you're comfortable doing. That way I have a better understanding what kind of character I'll be playing as.\n\nOh and one last thing... I dont do furries. Nothing against them but not my thing. I have half/human ocs /cat and bunny girls, etc/ \n\nSorry for the rules. I've been doing this song and dance for so long, and I've seen so many people disregard my comfort and lost interest. So if you've read the rules and  you\u2019re interested just PM and I\u2019ll  send over the contacts of which you can contact me over Discord or Email.\n\nAlso. I work 40hrs a week and somedays 6days in a row. If I do not answer/respond. I'm working. Or possibly doing adult things like errands or blanking out on netflix.",

The bells of the Tower of Hope toll loudly calling those who hear it to take arms and go to the street to cleanse those streets with purifying flame and wicked blades. Arm yourself young hunter and sign on the dotted line. A foreigner of a land far away and one who has come here in nothing but rags and riddled with disease. You have been administered the treatment you so desperately needed. Now that you are a healthy and able-body the payment of such a treatment is your service cleansing the streets. For the men and women who live here are no longer the same as they were. They grow larger, beastial, and savage. They crave blood from any source now, and they won\u2019t see you as anything other than what they are. A beast they too are sworn to kill. A hunter must hunt, and you are now a hunter. Take your weapons, arm your fire-arms, ready your magics and the mysteries of the School of Wi\u2019inal. The Hunters League accepts any able-bodied man or woman, be they short or tall, thin or thick. Have your wits about you, steel your courage and take to the streets.\n\nFor the Pale Blue Moon continues to descend, and the streets cover the dark labyrinth of secrets and horrors that will cause most to question their very existence. There are rumors of the city of Kin\u2019Alos being built upon the remains of a being of immense cosmic power, the infrastructure was adapted to the ribcage of such a monstrous beast, and the remains melt away slowly. The beasts that come up from the deep are said to be the monsters who consume the flesh of the great primal being far beneath the city. But those are rumors, and a hunter doesn\u2019t take stock in rumors. Hunters take stock in actions, whether they are quick dexterous moves, or the slow shattering attacks, keep in mind your weaponry and your style. And remember, never hunt alone. You have a host of those just like you back here in the Hunter\u2019s Temple. Come back every so often to reconnect with those who are just like you, and those who share in your goals. Make friends, become partners with those, and utilize them as resources if you should desire. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe nights of the hunt always seem to last the longest, and the pleasure one receives from imbibing the blood can be intoxicating. Much more than the alcohol that used to flood the streets of Kin\u2019Alos. The blood is our life source and its what closes the wounds caused by the beasts that we hunt. It\u2019s a dangerous practice us hunters take on. Imbibing the same substance that transforms those we hunt. Perhaps it\u2019s a symbolic gesture, but perhaps its just a means to the end. After all a hunter must hunt. Well, if you are ready, climb off the operating table, for you are restored to your former self and are no longer sick. You have signed the contract, your scrawl across the dotted line. There is no further reason for ceremony, go on and meet your fellow hunters. Arm yourself, and perhaps along the way, you will find your purpose in the waking world. Keep in mind, the hunt does not last forever, it will only feel that way.\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWelcome! I have been wanting to do a steam-punk fantasy based on the dark gothic world of Bloodborne. The month of October is the annual Return of Yharnam event, and I wanted to introduce this concept to a whole new audience. The game came out a few years back on PS4 and is made by From Software. The same folks who made Dark Souls. What sets this game apart is the beautifully dark gothic imagery and the circling of the ideas of the Cthulu mythos. Everything in the story, and this one will revolve around eldritch horrors no normal person could possibly comprehend. What sets this world apart is that it takes place in a fantasy world, meaning you can build your character to be anyone or anything. Like watching Critical Role? Like Lord of the Rings? Do you like dark gritty subjects and supernatural? This might be the roleplay for you.\n\nI am looking for someone to play a woman character, as I want some element of romance and NSFW elements in the roleplay. The ratio would be minimal, 70 story 30 smut. I do play multiple characters and strive for a minimum of 500 words per post, but I can write much much more. I am looking for someone who can write multiple characters, so none of which are the true main character. I am also looking for someone to do all their work on discord or email. I will try to respond to posts within 48 hours of you posting. I do work full time and I have a family, etc etc.\n\nDoes any of this interest you? If so, please send me a message on reddit, and we will work out the details from there.",

I don't have the time to reply every day but I try to respond once or twice a week. That being said, my replies are normally four to five paragraphs each time. And while I can't reply often, I love OOC chatter and I try to communicate regularly.\n\nI only write using Discord servers. It is what works best for me. \n\nMy style of writing is third-person, past-tense paragraph(s). My quantity varies with the plot and the scene in the moment; however, since my replies are not often, chances are my replies will be longer. I will not write in first-person.. I also will not write with anyone under 18 for this roleplay idea.\n\nWhile I want this to be adventurous, action-packed, death-filled, and more, I also want to include romance. \n\nI have four characters that will be in this story: Ashton, a 21 year old young man; Eliana, a 20 year old young woman; Kai, a 14 year old teenage boy; and Remi, a 6 year old little girl. Each have their own backstory and their own personality.\n\nThe best characters to match my four are strong, confident characters. That is mostly the personality I am searching for right now. I don't mind gender nor age; however, Eliana has always been portrayed as straight, as well as Ashton. \n\nI hope to hear from someone soon!",

I'm looking for a roleplay that focuses more on dialogue and banter, with some good characterization and a little bit of plot to go with it.\n\nThe idea I have in mind is pretty simple; I want to do a roleplay where we play a couple in a strained marriage. I don't mind an approach where either of us are at \"fault\" or a toxic sort of relationship where the fault lies on both parties. \n\nWith regards to that, I have a couple prompts to help us out:\n\n* In the first, we play a married could in a reasonably normal relationship. The drama stems from your character's profession (a police officer or military personnel) and my character's concern over safety and desire to start a family.\n\n* The second prompt focuses on a husband and wife in a historic or just rural setting. Nothing too complicated but the crux would be that my character is backwards and stuck in his ways while yours tries to get through to me.\n\nI guess we could work with one of those two, unless you have something in mind. I don't mind doing something more typical like my character being a criminal or something and, in addition to that, the roleplay could be either light-hearted or more on the darker side. We'll work those details out when the time comes.\nMessage me if interested.",

First let me state what I am looking for in a partner\n\n1. Someone who will chat OOC  \n\n   1. This helps to build us up so that we can be better with our characters\n2. Someone who is actually dedicated  \n\n   1. By this I mean someone who isn't so busy with life that they might drop off at the drop of a hat. If you think you are going to have something happen that might just take you out of being able to roleplay, please don't message me\n3. Someone who is communicative.  \n\n   1. Stuff happens, if it does, just let me know . I am not unreasonable, I just like to know that i am spending my time wisely\n4. I am looking for length to at minimum be about four sentences if not more in many cases. I can do a lot more if needed but I'd prefer no more novel level, I have one of those and those can be time consuming.\n5. Preferably over 25 but if you meet the above I am willing to make exceptions.\n\nWith that out of the way I am definitely looking for someone who is older than \\`18 as I tend to have some level of romance involved that could become NSWF . We can discuss those elements later.\n\nBeyond that I am looking for someone who is willing to do any of the above mentioned ideas. Some ideas I have tried that we could do\n\n1. Angle vs Demon\n2. Angel vs Angel\n3. Prince vs Commoner\n4. Commoner vs princess\n5. Other race vs human\n6. modern day boy vs modern day girl\n\nThat list isn't even close to be exhaustive, its just some examples of what I am ok playing. And the setting could be any. For instance, could be Angle vs Angle in modern day world. I would be ok with that. I prefer not to do Cannon Characters if we get into fandoms. As for other races I think something like a Succubi or Varmpire could work. \n\nAs note, this is Romance first and foremost so it must be in there, even if its slow. Even if our characters get teased. Maybe my character falls for yours, and then it takes a few years before your character comes along. I am ok with so many ideas. We can discuss these idea further if you are interested. I prefer discord but if you must do reddit chat I will do so on a different reddit account I use for chatting. If you have any idea of your own PLEASE let me know. I am up for playing some world you already have created. Anyways, Thank you for your time.",

            "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nHello  all, I'm relatively new to the role-playing scene here. I\u2019m interested in starting a story with one of my male characters in a unique world.  Growing up I was fascinated by LOTR and other olden time RPG type stories and I was hoping to re-create something  like that as far as the world goes. Although I can do something more modern. NSFW aspects are welcome, but I\u2019m  trying for that not to be the focus. Also, I would like it to be for a  longer RP so story lines can develop, and characters can grow so the  action might not come right away. I\u2019m not a stickler about where you go  with the story and I won\u2019t get all bent out of shape like some people do  when you don\u2019t adhere to their exact style or the direction they want  to go in. Just a chill laid back RP that we both can enjoy and be proud  of. Below will be the titles of some example prompts.\n\nAs for the writing style I  usually write anywhere between 200-500 words at a time in the 3rd  person, but you can write in whatever style you\u2019d. I\u2019m not going to say  I\u2019m the greatest when it comes to grammar, formatting, or even writing,  but I try my best, so please try too. We don\u2019t have to be too frequent,  maybe once or twice a week or more if you\u2019re really into it. OOC  conversations are very much welcome as we can brainstorm ideas to  develop characters and bounce ideas off each other.\n\nElven Emissary\n\nKnight x Princess\n\nPrincess Captured by Rebels\n\nPrincess running away from arranged marriage\n\nSeeking Necromancer \n\n \n\nFeel free to Message if you're interested. Cheers!! :)",

Not many people know who she is. In fact, your character does not know who she is until you call her manager and book her to do some murals for your work. It is lust at first sight and they fall for each other. However their relationship is tricky because you are always in the public eye. \n\nAnyway if this sounds interesting, PM me and we can see if we click. I write in 3rd person and I can use some actress to show what my character looks like. I can respond at least once a day and hope you can do the same. If not, let me know. I only roleplay on here, no discord or anything. Anyway let me know!",

            "selftext": "Hello writers!  \n\n\nI am seeking a long term roleplay partner for a romance/drama roleplay.   \nLet me introduce myself; my name is Elle, I am 26 years old and would prefer writing with a partner 20 and over. I mainly play female characters but I am open to playing male! I have been roleplaying for 15+ years on and off. I often find myself roleplaying literary plotlines that require a lot of world-building and large novel like replies. Lately, I have been craving a more \"simplistic\" roleplay. So here I am!   \n\n\n**DETAILS:**\n\n* I would love someone who is as enthusiastic as I am about the plotline and willing to bring ideas and plot twists to keep the story going.\n* I am all about faceclaims (no anime or cartoons), gifs and Pinterest boards!\n* I am not looking for a quick smut story. Although not opposed to NSFW content, I am seeking a tasteful writer.\n* I prefer writing in third person.\n* Life can get in the way sometimes, I would love to spend my time wisely with a writer who is committed to our character development. With that being said, I am not unreasonable, if something comes up just let me know! (I'm kind of sick of being ghosted tbh lol So if you plan on jumping ship don't message me please)\n* I prefer original characters; no canon.\n\n**PLOT IDEAS AND PROMPTS:**  \n*Here a just a few ideas of plots/pairings and prompts that have caught my eye and interest. I am open to so much more so if you'd like to discuss other ideas, don't hesitate!*\n\n* Supernatural (Angel, Vampire, Werewolf etc) x Human\n* Supernatural (Angel, Vampire, Werewolf etc) x Hunter\n* Supernatural (Witches/Seer x Ghost)\n* Roommates\n* Married Couple\n* Cop x Criminal\n* 50 shades of grey style pairing\n* Unrequited love (Best friends, Co-workers etc)   \nFor more ideas:  [https://www.pinterest.ca/ElleHendrikss/writing-prompts/](https://www.pinterest.ca/ElleHendrikss/writing-prompts/) \n\n**PLATFORMS:**\n\n* Discord",

            "selftext": "Hi there r/Roleplay\n\nIt's been a while since my last post, and it was a big success! However, I'm looking for some more writing friends to write with. There's not much you really need to know about me, but I'm hard-set on the following criteria: **3rd person** and **Discord**. This is non-negotiable as I'm busy enough as it is, I can't bother (nor want to) trudge through 8 different messaging apps just to send you a \"Hello\" and ask about your day. I'm not about that life.\n\n# What I'm looking for:\n\n* Someone who isn't in a rush. This is long-term, I want to sit back and enjoy the ride.\n* Able/willing to inform me if they're busy. No need to be shy, we all get busy.\n* Out of character communication.\n* Decently detailed responses (read: around Discord word limit, context-dependent. Sometimes, less is more.)\n\n# What I'm NOT looking for:\n\n* Dumb, mindless smut.\n* Fantasy plots.\n* Slice of life plots.\n* Sci-fi\n* Anime-esque character(s) who are just super good at everything. \n* Furries. Just no.\n\n# What can I offer:\n\n* Daily communication/chatter, roleplay.\n* I'll inform you of any inactivity/absence of mine.\n* Receptive of critique.\n* Can play games with you if that's your thing.\n* Creative ideas for Cyberpunk and/or STALKER-type settings.\n* Regular replies and interesting character(s).\n* Great character introspective.\n\n# Settings I prefer:\n\n* Cyberpunk\n* Post apocalypse (Severely limited to STALKER, don't even bother messaging me with \"Fallout\" in your message, please.)\n* Something like Code Vein could be cool.\n* Gritty military settings.\n* Psychological/drama, maybe a sprinkle of something supernatural? (Think Life is Strange)\n* Honestly, I like a lot of things and we can probably find something we both enjoy together. Just because it's not on this list, don't hesitate to message me. Maybe we just click.\n\n# Conclusion:\n\nI understand that I might come off as pretentious in this post, but I am looking for someone to spend a lot of time with and talk to on a daily basis. It is my time and I am not the type to just squander it willy-nilly, as it's not something I can recover whatsoever. \n\nIf you do decide to message me, please put your Discord tag anywhere in the message, so I know that you've paid attention to what I was saying. Because I will be paying a lot of attention to the things that you will be saying.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHave a nice day!\n\n\\-Click",

            "selftext": "Hi! I'm on the search for a new roleplay partner and I'm hoping I can catch the interest of someone interested in creating something immersive and enjoyable.\n \nI'm pretty versatile, though I usually play more masculine, older characters. When it comes to the setting, however, I'm open to pretty much anything.\n \nI have a few plots/prompts in mind:\n\n* Lawperson x Criminal - This is a pretty simple roleplay. One of us plays some kind of investigator/detective and the other plays someone who is intertwined with the criminal underground. This could be anything from a crooked cop story to a gangster's girlfriend turning into an informant.\n \n* Frontier/Apocalypse Life - Another pretty simple setting. In it we'd play a pair of hunters/trappers who live on the outskirts of society and make out living by dealing with dangerous prey/animals. Could also work as scavengers in a zombie scenario, if you're into that sort of thing.\n\n* Farm Life - This is one I've wanted to do for a while. In it I would play the role of an older, backwards-thinking farmer and my partner plays the role of someone from the city who is forced to live on my farm in some circumstance or another. Mostly deals with clashing personalities and whatnot.\n\nAll of these roleplays can be as light or dark as needed/appropriate. I don't mind involving pretty much any theme. I'm also open to pretty much any idea. These are just some I've had swimming around in my head.\n\nI would, however, prefer the roleplay to focus heavily on dialogue and exploring our characters. I like subtlety, banter, realistic dialogue and interactions. \n\nHit me up if you're interested in chatting. Bonus points if you're up for OOC chat as well. (Pro tip: I'm looking for someone to stay up late and watch the League of Legends world championship games with)",

            "selftext": "A little background: Hello my name is bubbajunk97! I am a long time discord server owner, creator, and moderator. I am also a game designer. I had an idea for a 3D RWBY fan game but I suck at art. The other day I was rearranging a servers channels and realized that with catagories that Discord makes a great place for a open world RP style server. So...\n\nHere's the pitch: I am not the best at Roleplaying(I'm learning) but I am good at server creation and creating game mechanics. So I need a team of people to help me establish and run this Roleplay world. I am looking for some one to be in charge of Roleplaying. This would Include helping me come up with the lore, I have an idea in mind but nothing set in stone. I am also looking for several people to be mods. They would be in charge of making sure that everyone follows the rules. They would also assist with character creation(I have an idea how it this would work just working out the kinks right now.). They may also play actors in special server wide events. (Mods can also be players, they just can't self moderate.) And lastly I will need server beta testers to, well test the server when we have things in place.\n\nSorry for the long post, but I want people to know I'm serious about this. \n\nI also have an idea about creating a bot to handle combat and stuff.\n\nIf interested please DM me here and we will start have a chat about your fit for the team.",

            "selftext": "Hey, I am heihoi, a woman on my later twenties and I have been roleplaying ever since I was like fifteen years old. I am literate and I put a great amount of work and detail into developing the characters, plot and the world they live in, so I want a partner who is into world-building too. I also enjoy writing multiple characters of different age, sex and sexuality so if you only want to write one-on-one romance I might not be the right partner for you. Roleplaying in my opinion is about giving and taking so in order for both of us to enjoy what we\u2019re doing I hope to find someone who is also able to and willing to write both men and women in gay and straight relationships. I do not require you to write out explicit scenes, that can be discussed in private but I don\u2019t like it when I am stuck in one role and the partner is in the other. I do put the plot above the smutty stuff, so keep that in mind.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0Still reading? Great, maybe this could work out! I like darker themes in my rps and I have almost no limits as long as the angst and attention is shared evenly between my characters and yours. I don\u2019t want to always write the knight in the shining armor but I don\u2019t expect that from you either. I enjoy personalities that clash, difficult and dramatic relationships (be it romantic or not) and I am not afraid to make my characters to act like total assholes at times. But even though I love the drama, it's not all about that and I really enjoy cute, fluffy stuff too.\u00a0\n\n\nSo, what I'm looking for?\n\n I don't have anything specific in mind but I like horror, slice of life, pirates, modern fantasy and crime stuff. If you like any of the same stuff, let's talk!\n\n\nI am not really interested in any other fandoms but Stranger things at the moment but would be super happy to do a Jonathan/Steve rp if I found a good partner for it!",

            "selftext": "Hello, I am 19 years old and male and I prefer you to be around the same age. I am currently looking for a long term romance roleplay partner to do that idea I recently got. Usually I make up a plot with the other person I write with, so I'm just going to write down the basic idea which I have in mind.\n\nThe roleplay starts with us waking up at another world in a fantasy or scifi setting. We are normal people in our world but suddenly we wake up at a different world. Some person or creature teleported us there, because we have to solve a mistery, fight some guys or accomplish something else for them, to rescue their world for example. We don't know each other yet and we don't even know where we are or what we have to do. We slowly start to find out that we will be rewarded when we accomplish what we had to do, by getting back home. During the whole thing we have to work together and we slowly fall in love with each other. I really like to include some action, drama, fantasy or dark themes to make everything more exciting. I like intense scenes, if we fight for our lives or get in danger it would be awesome. The whole plot is just a basic idea, I can discuss more details with you.\n\nI have been roleplaying for a few years now and I really like to put effort in my roleplays. I usually write around 10 lines per reply and I prefer kik when roleplaying, so I can reply often during the day. I am fine with nsfw scenes but I don't want a roleplay based on smut. It can be nice to heat up the romance, so one or two scenes should be okay. My first language is german and if you speak german too it would be awesome.\n\nIf you are interested, just PM me :)",

            "selftext": "First of all, a bit about me. I am an experienced, mature RPer who has a number of years of experience in different formats, including face-to-face, email, forums and the like. Primarily, I am interested in character interaction and development, especially through storytelling, conversation and relationship building. I like to see well developed, well thought out and believable characters. I prefer exotic or unusual settings, primarily science fiction, cyberpunk or post-apocalyptic. \u201cReal world/slice of life\u201d scenarios aren\u2019t that interesting to me; if it's something like a military or espionage setting, maybe, but not something 'mundane'. With that being said, I\u2019m open to ideas if they\u2019re original or creative or a little unusual.\n\nI generally like well-written, well thought out posts, and definitely prefer quality over quantity. I don\u2019t want to read a novel with each post, but I don\u2019t want to see one-line-wonders. Similarly, I am a stickler for grammar and spelling and punctuation, although I am prone to the odd bout of ferocious typos myself. However, as long as the intent is there, then I\u2019m happy.\n\nMy interests lie in mutual storytelling and creativity, rather than playing along to somebody else\u2019s story or the like. I control my character, I decide what\u2019s going on with them, I create their background and so on. I ask for my partners to respect that, as I will do the same for them. Likewise, I will never launch a major story element or a plot twist or the like without okaying it with a partner, as I would expect them to do the same for me. If I do something a partner doesn't want, then I'll gladly change it, but I ask that they will do the same for me.\n\nI\u2019m flexible as to settings and backgrounds. I am currently looking for **Sci-Fi**, **Cyberpunk** and **Post-Apocalyptic** RP in original settings. I am also interested in fandom RPs based on **Star Wars**, **Battletech/Mechwarrior, Shadowrun** and **Fallout**, but only using OCs. I am **only** looking for one-on-one RP, not groups or Player/GM experiences.",

            "selftext": "I'm looking for something inspired by the likes of Monster Musume, although if you haven't seen it or read it, no worries! The idea is pretty simple, so no real outside knowledge is required! Essentially, I want to play a regular human guy in a world where monster girls are just part of every day city life. Lamias, harpies, centaurs, slimes, and whatever other esoteric monster girls we can think of!\n\nI'd like this to be a sort of romantic, slice-of-life story about the two of us learning to live together and deal with the complications of living in a human world.\n\nThere is a potential for adult content, so I'd prefer a partner who is 18+ and okay with that, but it's something I would only want happening after a good length of time and build up. I like creating plots and developing characters, so that would be the primary goal. My posts are usually in the 1-3 paragraph range, and I'd like a partner who is in that range, too. Obviously they can be much shorter or much longer, when they need to be, but that's my usual range. \n\nI'm comfortable playing characters of any sex and gender expression. I like my roleplays to have a good mix of drama and humor and romance and adventure. I also enjoy playing multiple characters, so if you do, too, that's a big plus! There's always room for more monster girls! And my preferred platform for roleplay is Discord, though I am open to discussing other options. \n\nIf any of this interests you, shoot me a message! If you kind of like it, but have some tweaks or suggestions you'd like to make, I'm also all ears. Hope to hear from you!",

            "selftext": " \n\nBefore I get started I want to make it clear that I\u2019m pretty laid back but this post is gonna be somewhat strict. I\u2019ve come across a lot of people asking to roleplay but then as we begin they\u2019re aren\u2019t following the requirements I stated prior. PLEASE read through everything! \n\n**About Me**\n\nAnyway! Hi, I'm Aterose and currently looking for a long term roleplay partner, though that much is obvious. I\u2019m a nineteen-year-old female living in the EST timezone. I have about 8-9 years of writing experience and consider myself pretty literate.\n\n**What I\u2019m Searching For**\n\nI am searching for someone who can write a well amount. I\u2019m talking around two to three paragraphs minimum. I understand dialogue can lessen this, but that doesn\u2019t mean you give me strictly dialogue and little detail. We all get writer\u2019s block, but even then I\u2019d like to see the thought process behind the character and all that. I can't stress this enough. There have been multiple occasions where my partners start out strong but fail to carry out when it comes to length. These replies usually die down to a sentence or two and at that point I'll have to leave the roleplay. I really want to grow as a writer and I don't see myself doing that when given a few sentences to work with.\n\nI\u2019m also looking for someone who wants to chat OOC. I love building a friendship with my partners and sharing pictures/music that reminds me of our characters. So, if you aren\u2019t very social or don\u2019t really want to talk then I\u2019d skip over me and look for someone else.\n\nI will only roleplay on Discord and in third person. I also ask you play BOTH male and female characters. \n\n**What I\u2019m Interested In**\n\nSandbox! I\u2019m all for sandbox. It leaves a ton of room to do whatever we want, which means a long term roleplay. I almost always do dystopian future settings and possibly some fantasy thrown in there.\n\nI don't do fandoms but I *may* (that's a big may) be open to a Fullmetal Alchemist world with our own characters. It would take place after the events of the series and our two characters could be upcoming alchemists? We can talk more about the plot if interested. \n\nOther than that I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m interested in right now, I\u2019ve been branching out due to partners having some pretty amazing ideas so I guess I\u2019ll just continue with that. Just throw whatever ideas you got at me and we can figure something out!\n\nI will not do modern, most fandoms, canon characters, historic, smut (I prefer to keep it PG-13 then fade to black). \n\nIf you're interested or just have questions shoot me a message with your ideas and a little bit of information about yourself.  I will not respond to chat requests or \"Still looking?\". Hope to hear from you soon?",

            "selftext": "Hey guys!  Guess what, I'm still *looking4trouble* haha. Trying to find a happy medium I decided to make a simple yet extensive thread. It shows not only my preferences but also hopefully will expose all the possible differences between us. Under \"Compatibility Check\" I'm highlighting those aspects that I found me and potential partners were sometimes not matching at in the past.\n\nGo ahead, check this out and lemme know if you're one of those rare individuals who belongs to the breed of *collaborative writers*. Who instinctively knows how much and how detailed to write in each scene. How to use \"show not tell\" in the most optimal way. Who can deliver all the true personalities and those raw emotions of adult men, not boys. Challenged by sometimes extreme circumstances and forced to show their vulnerable side.\n\nLet's mix all the clich\u00e9 with the most unique we can think of and write stories that people would pay to see in the movies!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Yes Please**\n\n\u2714     thrilling yet realistic action with heartbreaking, well dosed drama as well as intense but organic MxM romance\n\n\u2714    creating large casts of  tangible, multi dimensional characters and rediscovering them in new settings/verses\n\n\u2714    main characters that are (or at least appear/aspire to be) physically and mentally capable and confident manly guys, acting accordingly to their age and life experience; men who in life and romance naturally fall into equal x equal dynamics\n\n\u2714    decent size posts with length adjusted to what scene calls for; rich in detail and giving insight into character's mind\n\n\u2714    exploring various themes and genres with the right combo of character development, exciting plot and some world building, while leaning towards modern/realistic vibe\n\n\u2714    open, sincere communication with a long-term partner and frequent OOC chatter to keep the spark alive!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Not Interested In**\n\n\u2718    situations/characters that don't feel believable; realism is important even in \"unreal\" verses\n\n\u2718    not well fleshed out personalities or making characters act OOC\n\n\u2718    weak/needy/feminine appearing males as main characters, predetermined caregiver x cared-for dynamics and anything that might seem  \"too immature\" or \"too angsty\"\n\n\u2718    overusing dark/heavy themes (like suicide, health issues, addictions) by making them become one of the main traits of a character/story\n\n\u2718    letting rper's mood or knowledge affect their post\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Compatibility Check \u32e1**\n\nHow are we doing so far? Do you feel like we're seeking and offering similar things? Let me touch on few spots we might vary at, to help you figure that out!\n\nI don't look for a partner for a single rp or single genre/theme. I'd like us to share general interests and enjoy writing multiple stories, eventually adjusted to our \"current cravings\". And even though I don't mind making new, additional characters each time, I'd like us to grow to love some \"core group\" of them. That we can rediscover in AUs/alternative paths etc.\n\nThat's why it's so important for me to not only use NPCs and typical side characters to \"fill the world\" our mains live in, but to create at least few main characters. Or at least a good number of decently developed \"sides\" who could turn into mains one day.\n\nIf you're game for such a long lasting rp-bromance, please note that even though I very much enjoy unreal verses or some fantasy/sci fi elements in my rps, I am leaning towards  \"nowadays reality\". Advanced tech? Apocalyptic world? Urban fantasy or futuristic elements? Maybe even deep space, historical or high fantasy world? All that could be my thing, but my go-to is modern/realistic mix of action+romance+drama.\n\nOne last thing. But in a way most important one. *Characters*. At the end of the day, whatever the verse we explore and whatever the plot we develop... the fictional, yet in our minds not any less *living and breathing* humans who experience all the hardship and happiness our brains produce, are the most important part of the story. And for me to enjoy ours? All main characters have to give that vibe of a physically and mentally realistic, masculine, mature man. I will happily elaborate on this one!\n\n**Still on board? Awesome! I hope by now you can tell that I'd like to meet people who will not just \"try to meet my requirements\". I hope they will simply** ***share*** **similar preferences. So they can enjoy my writing as much as I hope to enjoy theirs. If you think we have potential? Go ahead and PM me, share what you think we have in common or if that's easier, just list the things we vary at. Hope to hear from you soon!**",

I\u2019m a huge fan of romance so I\u2019d like it to center around that, but I also want to make it fun so we can add another theme to spice things up if you want, be it darker or lighter. I\u2019d consider it more slice of life but I like making it more creative and interesting than just playing out normal day to day stuff. I prefer smut as well but it\u2019s not required.\n\nWe can discuss more individually how we want to set the story up, but to give you an outline I want my character to be a stereotypical stud athlete. He is very popular and has girls left and right trying to get with him. He ends up falling for your character, who is an unpopular, nerdy outcast type of girl and then we just play out our relationship.\n\nI can do both 1st and 3rd person, and prefer Discord servers for communication. I am in school so I might not be able to answer a lot long term but I am on fall break right now so we should be able to at least get things going this weekend. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested shoot me a message and we can start working things out!",

I love how multi dimensional and flawed the characters are and how the story focuses on their inner battles and personal growth which is something I enjoy in my rps the most too. We could use the existing characters or create our own, I'm happy either way if I just find someone to do this with me. \n\n I enjoy mxm when it comes to romance but since I enjoy writing multiple characters we can add fxf or fxm as well. Now, I know in the show they're very young so I'd like to age them up a little. Maybe around the age of 16-18. I'd also like to include the characters that are not piloting the EVAs and who are adults. No smut between characters under the age of 18. Reposting this for that clarification. Between adults it's fine but to be honest, I'm not a huge fan of it and don't like including that just for the sake of it. If it is important for the plot then it's okay. \n\nI'm 21+ and won't write with anyone under the age of 20. Due to the nature of the show the rp will include mature themes so I'm not comfortable with anyone younger than that. I really hope I can find someone for this, it's something I've wanted to do for a while now!\n\nOh, and one more thing. If you don't want to do a NGE roleplay but are into giant robots and psychology let's do something original with the same themes!",

So, if we would be starting from scratch I would be interested in pursuing one of a few ideas:\n\n\\~Medieval fantasy.  \n(Yes very typical) inspired by the middle-far east more heavily than the West, take Essos opposed to Westeros from ASOIAF (GoT) I am absolutely fascinated by the mythology and history of regions less explored in fantasy. \n\n\\~Post-apocalypse.   \nI'm very picky when it comes to RP based in a future setting or a sci-fi setting, I have to say I don't like concepts I cannot scientifically or pragmatically explain to myself so pseudo-science makes little sense whereas mysticism does? So yeah, let's go with that, I don't enjoy zombies etc but hit me up with some crazy stuff mixed between post-modern and sci-fi (like shown in the 100) then I would love it!\n\n\\~Historical Thriller/Political Fiction.   \nThis is where all those WWII stories and anything inspired by *The Favourite* belongs, I absolutely love suspenseful, historical drama as popularised by the BBC, ITV etc and endeavour to explore it further in my own writing and would appreciate a partner who would like to pursue a similar genre. I have a couple of settings I would like to explore and I'm unsure if I want to only do fictional characters or if I would be happy doing events on a historically accurate basis... depends on the RP. \n\n\\~All fantasy.   \nFantasy in the broader sense... I just love fantasy okay?\n\n\\~Any and all of your ideas!  \nHit me up even if nothing above or below ticks your boxes because I'm always looking for great ideas and oddly enough I don't have them all!  \n\n\nRegarding Fandom based RP I watch a lot less \"internet zeitgeists\" than most individuals on this subreddit... But here goes.\n\n    ATLA/LOK    (Avatar: The Last Airbender/ Legend Of Korra)\n\n* The 100\n* ASOIAF     (GoT)\n* HTTYD     (How To Train Your Dragon Movies/Television)\n* Disney\n* Orange is the new Black\n* Vampire Knight (Not so much the anime more their lore around Vampires)\n* Pokemon (Games)\n* Fairy Tail (Again, not so much the anime but the lore is enjoyable) \n* FNAF (Same as previous)\n* Gothic Horror (Stuff like Dracula etc)\n* Probably more but I can't think sorry!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow that you've read all of that and I've gotten your hopes up let us continue... \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Logistics**\n\nI am recently out of education and as of now (October 13th) I am unemployed, which gives me a lot of time to truly focus on my writing, this may change in the future but for now that means I am available often so one reply a day can make me lose interest in an RP. I am 18 and would be interested in writing adult topics, that doesn't have to be smut, just as easily horror themes etc and that leads me to want partners to be AT LEAST 16 years old but preferably 18 or above. \n\nFurthermore, I am British (that's EST-5) but my sleeping schedule does allow for more action during the evenings and I have partners from all over the world all of which I am able to write with frequently and consistently. I live with my parents and older sister so I would not be interested in doing anything that involves VC as this is unreliable on my end. \n\nBeyond that, I typically use Discord for RP but am open to using Googledocs and am always happy to use Chatzy (where I began my RP journey all those years ago). Please DM me if you are looking to join this adventure with me as I tend to not respond to commenters. I hope to hear from you soon!",

            "selftext": " \n\nHello! I'm bee, and I'm back looking for a few writing partners. I'm 26 and a grad student who works part-time teaching music theory and instrumental improvisation skills. Because of this, during the work/class week (M-F), I am typically unavailable during the daytime hours. I am usually available every evening, and all day on the weekends.  I tend to prefer writing partners that share interests with me and who are friendly and willing to chat out of character. Honestly, if you're not making friends with the people you write with... what are ya even doing? \n\nAs far as my writing style goes, I prefer writing and reading in the third person and past or present tenses. My comfort zone is around four to six paragraphs, but I'm perfectly capable of and okay with typing more or less depending on your preferences. The majority of my writing experience is in Fantasy of all varieties, Wild-Western themes, Supernatural or Horror themes, Romance, and Historical Fiction. I'm interested in spreading out more into Science Fiction but have no interest in writing slice-of-life unless any of the previously listed themes are also involved. I've got experience writing in both fandom-based settings and original settings, and enjoy both a lot! When writing in fandoms, I am okay with taking on any gender and playing against any gender. I'll RP oc x oc, canon x canon (though I do tend to get picky about my pairings), and canon x oc (in this case, I always request a double.) That mentioned I love doubling, tripling, or playing a large cast against another large cast. In original settings, I'll also play multiple characters and against/as any gender. \n\nAt the moment, I'm specifically looking for roleplay set in the Elder Scrolls universe. I'm a bit of a lore-head, so in all honesty, I'd prefer writing partners who are also very well versed in the lore. I'm open to writing around \"historical\" events in the universe, or around specific canonical subjects, or even creating a new time and series of events! I've played all of the games, read much of the literature, and spend way too much time watching lore vids on youtube or surfing the UESP. I've got a few ideas in mind, so if this interests you, please reply here or send me a private message.\n\nI'm also seeking stories set in Earth's past! It's been a long time since I found a decent historical fiction partner! I'm interested in the ancient world as well as some closer-to-recent eras. If you like historical fiction, let me know \"when\" your interests are! Additionally, I'm always on the hunt for new fantasy settings! If you'd prefer to craft something together, let me know!\n\nThat's all I have to say for now. As I said above, please contact me here or in a private message! As a last note, here's a word bank of mine- if any of the concepts seem interesting to write around, let me know! \n\n*insightful apparitions, wandering and wounded spirits, a shallowly cheerful memory, obvious and magnificent truths just barely disguised by the mundane, the farthest reaches of space, the closest reaches of space, the in between places, twilight, secrets that could free a people, secrets that could destroy a world, faeries and goblins making deals, the fae, terrible things that lurk in the dark, the wild west, enchanted castles, enchanted meadows hidden in the woods, enchanted worlds, undersea kingdoms, a world blanketed in deadly snow, social change brought on by climate change, the end of the world, the mundane becoming the horrifying, the horror found in human beings, human kindness in a sea of such monsters, monstrous kindness in a sea of humans, hidden governments, flappers and mobsters, cursed buildings, portals that anyone could happen upon, poorly guarded treasure, journeys to end wars and curses, wizards at their minimum wage jobs, planets with death hidden at their cores, places too close to dying stars, time kerfuffles, grief, dichotomies, great power in unlikely sources, a last ditch effort to save a species, a struggle for survival, sprawling sewer cities, roadtrips, and i just want to go home*",

Like what do the guardians do on their time off? Do they have relationships or children? What does the light do to them on a daily basis? \n\nI prefer female partners but I know that is kinda hard to find for an rp like this so I an opening it up for Male partners as well.

Said prompt is also open once again for the same reason! With that out of the way though: Hi! I'm back again, looking for a partner for something a bit different from my last post (but if you're interested in my last post, do say so!). Please 18+ Only, as i'm above 18 and only really comfortable with playing with somebody who is as well. All of that out of the way, onto the idea.\n\nHolly... the object of your affections and she's oblivious to it. For as long as you can really remember her and your sister were inseperable, the best of friends even into their young adulthood. Naturally you'd gotten to know her a little as well given how often she was at your house, though you'd never really spoken one to one or anything.\n\nI mean she was there for your sister not you. Or at least, that's what you think. And while that is mostly true, the older girl has always had a soft spot for her best friends little sibling but never quite knew how to tackle it - or if it'd be okay for her to do so at all.\n\nShe never dared dream that said sibling felt the same way, let alone thought anything would come of it but hey, you never know right?\n\nYour big sis was having a party, but you'd had a rough week and you weren't really feeling it, so you decide to spend the night in your room instead, playing video games, writing, drawing, reading, whatever you get up to in your freetime. When a certain someone joins you...\n\nSo yeah that's the idea! Could go longterm (preferable in fact) and may involve NSFW things later if things go that way. Now, i'm about to go deal with IRL stuff but I promise i'll reply ASAP! Hope to hear from you soon!",

            "selftext": "It's almost hard to believe that it's been a year(ish) since I last searched for this.\n\nWell. Anyway. With the recent launch of shadowkeep for Destiny 2, I've found myself overwhelmed with a craving to write in the game\u2019s universe. Of course, with completely original characters and storylines, but with plenty of references to established lore. It's practically a font of untapped RP goodness, and I haven't actually managed to get anything quite like I imagine just yet. Which, I suppose, is why I'm writing this post up.\n\nRegardless, I should mention that romance is something that I'll actively be looking for, as that's an element that I enjoy mixing into things. Who doesn't like a bit of tension added to normal, everyday lives of guardians? Well, as normal as fending off bloodthirsty nightmares and other assorted baddies can get. Because of my want for romance, I'll have to confirm that I'm only looking for partners that are 18+. No exceptions. It's a comfort thing, sorry if that doesn't work out.\n\nAs for me, I'm an experienced roleplayer, with plenty of years under my belt. I tend to prefer a more short, rapid fire posting style, ranging from 1-3 paragraphs per post, depending on the content of the message I'm replying to. Third person perspective, past tense, all that good jazz. Adult themes are good with me, as well, though in moderation. Wouldn't want the RP ruled by that, after all. All of this being said, I'm looking for a partner of the same literacy level. Just a small add-on.\n\nI haven't gone into detail what *exactly* I'm looking for yet, have I? Well, allow me to elaborate. I'm looking to set this in a *post* forsaken story timeline. If you've played shadowkeep already, wonderful, we can start from there. If you're starting from new light, and just know the basics, no problem. I'm fairly flexible, and all I ask is that the RP is kept moving forward. But on that note, I'm not looking for a purely action based story. I love the slower stuff. Slow build, idle downtime between characters, just time that isn't bullets flying all over the place. That's not to say I don't want that, just in moderation. You can only write *so* much action before it gets stale, after all.\n\nI should probably cut this here before I go super off track. Simply put, if you enjoy destiny, shoot me a message. I\u2019m sure we can work something out that we\u2019ll both enjoy. I will ask that you know a decent bit about the story (not deep lore, I'm not a stickler for that), as I'd prefer not have to teach it, or subject someone to the entire storyline.\n\nOh, and before I go, please keep in mind that I wrote this while fairly tired. Kinda not a smart idea on my part, but eh, what can ya do?\n\nEdit: Since it needs to be said, please don't comment on this post. I won't reply to it, especially if it's telling me to message *you*, or something to that effect.",

I'm in college and have a pretty chill job so I'm free and able to respond alot during the day and night.

I really enjoy romance and have a couple of ideas on stories, but if you've got ideas you want to try I'm more than happy to hear them! \n\nStory ideas include: \n-School exclusively for students of extraordinary talents\n-Assistant to Popstar/Actor\n-Highschool President and Vice President\n-Any idea you have! \n\nIf you're interested just pm me and we can talk out what to do.",

I don't have the time to reply every day but I try to respond once or twice a week. That being said, my replies are normally four to five paragraphs each time. And while I can't reply often, I love OOC chatter and I try to communicate regularly.\n\nI only write using Discord servers. It is what works best for me. \n\nMy style of writing is third-person, past-tense paragraph(s). My quantity varies with the plot and the scene in the moment; however, since my replies are not often, chances are my replies will be longer. I will not write in first-person.. I also will not write with anyone under 18 for this roleplay idea.\n\nWhile I want this to be adventurous, action-packed, death-filled, and more, I also want to include romance. \n\nI have four characters that will be in this story: Ashton, a 21 year old young man; Eliana, a 20 year old young woman; Kai, a 14 year old teenage boy; and Remi, a 6 year old little girl. Each have their own backstory and their own personality.\n\nThe best characters to match my four are strong, confident characters. That is mostly the personality I am searching for right now. I don't mind gender nor age; however, Eliana has always been portrayed as straight, as well as Ashton. \n\nI hope to hear from someone soon!",

I generally respond in a literate, multi-paragraph format.\n\nRight now, I'm looking to do a medieval, fantasy, sci-fi or cyberpunk themed roleplay. I did not have a set plot or idea in mind, as I would like this to be a collaboration between us, but some of the genres I love delving into involve action, adventure, thriller, and angst/grit. Therefore, I'm extremely flexible on all ideas and would be happy to work with you to build something we can both enjoy. \n\nI do have some requirements for partner\n\n\u00b7 21+ please\n\n\u00b7 Ability to write detailed responses in a multi-para format\n\n\u00b7 Strong literacy/writing skills\n\n\u00b7 Be open to exploring mature/dark themes.

            "selftext": "Hi there! So this idea came after watching a mini documentary on the Mona Lisa. I just thought how amazing it is that a painting that would be considered mediocre at the time it was painted is now one of the most valuable on the entire planet. Imagine how much effort and money the worlds elite would contribute to getting it back if it were to be \"taken hostage\". \n\nSetting: so the roleplay would be set mainly in a tiny little apartment just a five minute walk away from Universit\u00e9 Paris. Its a rather old building, like most in the city, but the interior has a modern feel after it was renovated to attract young university tenants. This particular apartment room, 128a, is almost empty. \n\nThe small kitchen with its modern fittings is easily the most furnished room there. There's a grey 2 seater couch in the middle of the living room and an indoor fern in the corner. A lonely, portrait of Che Guevara hangs on the white wall, making it the centre of attention. Down short the passage there's a tiny bathroom and a small bedroom with a single bed and nothing else. \n\nMy character: 21 year old Amala Koubou is an exchange student at Universit\u00e9 Paris. Her three years as a Politics and Psychology major have moulded her into a very educated, opinionated young woman. She lives in 128a with her boyfriend (who you can create as you wish) and they share, what some might consider, extreme views about the bourgeoisie despite coming from not-so-humble homes themselves. \n\nPlot summary: Their anti-elitist views become more and more extreme after the yellow vest protests in Paris. (FYI: The yellow vest movement is motivated by rising fuel prices and a high\u00a0cost of living; it claims that a\u00a0disproportionate burden\u00a0of the\u00a0government's tax reforms\u00a0were falling on the working and middle classes)\n\nThey plot to steal the Mona Lisa at the Louvre to prove a point. This roleplay is the days leading up to the heist; during and after they've successfully stolen it, along with other artefacts.\n\nIt will have some smut involved \u2013 of course that keeps it interesting; some drug use and violence as well. They're pretty much a toxic pair but very intelligent in their own right when drugs aren't involved. If you're interest just comment below with your kik or pm me and we could discuss further details. I'm open to hearing your input so this is a good, fun experience for both of us.\n\nLooking forward to getting started, au revoir!",

First let me state what I am looking for in a partner\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Someone who will chat OOC\n   1. This helps to build us up so that we can be better with our characters\n2. Someone who is actually dedicated\n   1. By this I mean someone who isn't so busy with life that they might drop off at the drop of a hat. If you think you are going to have something happen that might just take you out of being able to roleplay, please don't message me\n3. Someone who is communicative. \n   1. Stuff happens, if it does, just let me know . I am not unreasonable, I just like to know that i am spending my time wisely\n4. Preferably over 25 but if you meet the above I am willing to make exceptions.   \n\n\nWith that out of the way I am definitely looking for someone who is older than \\`18 as I tend to have some level of romance involved that could become NSWF . We can discuss those elements later.   \n\n\nBeyond that I am looking for someone who is willing to do any of the above mentioned ideas. Some ideas I have tried that we could do\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Angle vs Demon\n2. Angle vs Angle\n3. Prince vs Commoner\n4. Commoner vs princess\n5. Other race vs human\n6. modern day boy vs modern day girl\n\nThat list isn't even close to be exhaustive, its just some examples of what I am ok playing. And the setting could be any. For instance, could be Angle vs Angle in modern day world. I would be ok with that. I prefer not to do Cannon Characters if we get into fandoms.   \n\n\nAs note, this is Romance first and foremost so it must be in there, even if its slow. Even if our characters get teased. Maybe my characters falls for yours, and then it takes a few years before your character comes along. I am ok with so many ideas. We can discuss these idea further if you are interested. I prefer discord but if you must do reddit chat I will do so on a different reddit account I use for chatting. Anyways, Thank you for your time.",

They deserve to fade into legend. No. It's time for a new spirit detective. And I want you to find a cantidate.\"\n\nI'd like the roleplay to focus on the new spirit detective squad, but short interactions with Canon characters is expected. I'd also like if we can each play 2 characters, and I'd like my partner to play the new Spirit Detective. This anime is my favorite of all time and has a special meaning to me, and I'm making one last attempt to find a partner for it.\n\nRomance, action, martial arts, adventure and mystery await in the new generation.",
