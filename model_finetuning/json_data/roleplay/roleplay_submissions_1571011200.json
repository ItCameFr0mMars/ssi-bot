            "selftext": "It's a normal day in Potterstown, Oregon. Perhaps you get up, make coffee, decide to walk out to get the paper. On the way to the curb, you note with displeasure that your front yard has two-foot wide bootprints running across it. Sounds like it's time to complain to the HOA again about your neighbor, the Ettin, and their habit of cutting through yards.\n\nInside, you open the paper and turn to the local news. There's an article about an upcoming blood drive sponsored by the Friends of the Needful, to provide nourishment for the town's vampire population. There's also an op-ed by an agitated citizen arguing against The Facade, claiming that now is the time to go public and stop hiding from the rest of the world at large. Looney. There's always a few of them.\n\nYour kid comes down and asks what's for breakfast and you inform them that eggs and toast are on the menu. They complain that the Glitterbell kids get to eat honey and nectar shakes, and you counter with explaining that faerie physiology is different, so, sorry Charlie.\n\nCarpool arrives and it's off to work. Your coworker, Bob, mentions that he's been dating a half-demon girl, and things are getting really hot. You decide not to comment on that, or the suspicious looking burn marks. To each their own.\n\nAs you enter the office, your ears are assaulted by the horror that is Dwarven War Chants on the shared radio. Apparently Churnog got to work first and got his mix-CD into the system. Good thing there are ear plugs at your desk. It's definitely a Monday.\n\nMonstertown USA is a Discord-based RP server set in Potterstown, Oregon, a place where, due to bizarre cosmological twists, weird and supernatural creatures live side-by-side with their human neighbors, and agree to a shared veil of secrecy known as The Facade. Come find your place in the stories with us!\n\n[https://discord.gg/sBsf4CV](https://discord.gg/sBsf4CV)",

My  english experience didn't start until 5 years ago. During the day I work  at a daycare for people with mental disabilities and autism. During the  night I rewatch the same series for the 7th time. It's a real hoot.\n\nI  love writing, even if I'm not the fastest to respond. But the most  important reason for roleplaying is making friends. I love talking to  new people, whether it be about roleplays or other subjects.\u00a0\n\nI  don't have a specific thing I am looking for. So feel free to suggest  your ideas and I'll see if it speaks to me or not. Expect me to be  pretty hype about whatever we are doing. Im the type to constantly spam  my partner with images, ideas etc. I also like finding faceclaims, so  there is that. If that isn't to your liking, feel free to say so. I will  hold myself back.\n\nNSFW themed rps aren't an issue, so long as it doesn't take away from the plot.\u00a0\n\nSome  of the fandoms I enjoy include Marvel, ASOIAF/GoT and The Witcher. I  have a ton more, but these are the ones Im interested in for now. Im  also a sucker for anything fantasy, mythology or western themed.\n\nId love to hear from some of you, and thank you for reading this thread.\n\nMuch love,\u00a0\n\nMunch",

You have two choices here:  \n\n\n\\[Humans\\] \"Do you have a ticket?\" The question get's raised, to which you raise your eyebrow. Feeling in to your pockets you shove your hand in and pull out as to what looks like an old carnival ticket.  At the sight of the ticket the eyes glitter with excitement and a hand comes out of the shadows. It's nails long and black, with what looks like it is also covered in fur.  \"You may enter.\" The voice hisses with excitement as you look forward and see a carnival. that wasn't there just moments ago. But what you didn't know that this carnival will change your life forever with the question being raised of, will you be able to escape?.  \n\n\n\\[Demon\\] \"What are you?\" Comes the voice from the shadows again. \"You aren't human...\" The eyes smile in a teasing way.  You nervously answer as to what type of creature you are and eyes move, as if the creature was nodding.  \"Welcome -name- the Dark Carnival is your home, now. It is a safe space, where only the chosen humans come for us to taunt. If you need any help, search for The Fox.\" The voice said as a card on a lanyard was given in to your hands from the shadow, by the same black hand, and you made your way in to the Dark Carnival, where you didn't have to hide in your human form.\n\n\\---\n\nWelcome to the Dark Carnival, we are a small discord group looking for more people to join us and help us grow. All characters are welcome, we do love a variety. PM or comment if interested please!",

As mentioned in the title I am not looking for fandom roleplays, though we can draw inspiration from relatable franchises if necessary. Regarding characters I will only do OC's and expect the same from you. I'm alright with face claims, but I believe making a character unique to the rp just makes things flow more smoothly. :))\n\nFirst off, some practical information:\n\n\\- I'm in timezone GMT +1\n\n\\- I'm available mostly on the weekends as I have a lot to do throughout the week. \n\n\\- English is not my first language, therefore my vocabulary is limited. (I'm still very descriptive though!)\n\n\\- For now I'm not looking for anything besides what's described here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyhow, on to the roleplay itself. Regarding the plot I have a lot planned out in my head that I would love to discuss, I also have a lot of different ideas, pointing in different directions.   \nI am open to the rp including some NSFW stuff, as long as it doesn't take over. I'm a sucker for action and I am one overdramatic son of a birch. I get bored a bit too easily, so I like to spice things up with action, plottwists and unexpected attacks etc. I'm not shy to kill characters, this also meaning that I can play multiple characters at once.   \n\n\nFor me it's very important to be able to talk openly with my partner and I need to be sure that I can express if I'm not happy with how things are. This goes both ways, of course. Discussion and agreement to work out how the roleplay will suit both of us the best is key to me. I want it to be a nice experience for both of us!  \n\n\nIf you'd like to hear more, please message me (not those direct chat things, I don't check them) and we can figure out if we're compatible!",

            "selftext": " \n\nHello hellooo!\n\nJust to get right into it, I'm Phoenix! I'm 23, EST and usually have free days so I'm able to post a lot. And I'm going to go ahead and apologize if this post gets a tad rambly but I am terrible at introductions and this is my first post here!\n\nSo, I've been roleplaying for about 8+ years with multiple long breaks throughout the years. I exclusively write in third person past tense. My post lengths are anywhere from 1-6 parahraphs (I know that's a big jump) but it all just depends on my level of inspiration, what I have to work off of, or how in depth the roleplay is in general. While I don't want the roleplay to be \"adult\" in nature, I would like to include darker, more mature themes so please don't message me if you are not 18+\n\nNow, into genres and such!\n\n**Main genres/Things I'm interested in:**\n\n* **Romance! -** I am *such* a sucker for romances. I'll take the cliches, fluff, slice of life type, opposites, childhood friends, that sort of thing. I'm also all for those slow burns, the more intricate and complex relationships that take time blossom. As long as there's a romance involved, I'm happy!\n* **Adventure! -** There's an endless amount of paths and conflicts to come up with and set our characters up against!\n* **Drama -** I'm always down for that internal conflict, angst, or just dramatic situations for our characters to work through!\n* **Slice of Life -** Nothing wrong with some casual fluff!\n* **Medieval -** Any kind of world here works, whether we put OC's in an already existing world (even if it's yours) or if we want to build our own! *Bonus points if there are dragons involved.*\n* **Modern**\n* **Supernatural -** Vampires, werewolves, magic, super/psychic powers, you name it!\n* **Sci-Fi -** I'll be honest, I haven't had too much experience with this genre but the little bit I had was pretty fun and I wouldn't mind trying it again!\n* ***Or any mixture of these!***\n* Creativity and communication! Please don't be shy about sharing your ideas or even rejecting mine. Don't just say \"I dunno, whatever you want.\" This is a joint effort and I want us both to enjoy it and be creative. And please, if you're going to be gone for a while or won't be able to post much, just let me know and I will do the same for you.\n* Also, I love OOC chat and being friendly with my partners. I also really enjoy sending gifs or pictures, or even songs that revolve around the roleplay. If you don't, just let me know and I will try to hold back on all of that.\n\n**Things I am** ***NOT*** **interested in:**\n\n* **~~Smut~~** **-** Look, I know that a lot of people like including this in their roleplays, but it just doesn't interest me very much. I prefer mostly fade to black/time skips. If that turns you away, I'm sorry and I hope you find a great partner that suits you best!\n* **Steampunk -** I've just never really had much interest with this\n* **Word quotas -** I'm all about writing what feels right. If all the scene needs is a paragraph or two, then that's all you need to write. If you want to pump out four or five because you're feeling particularly inspired, absolutely go right again! Writing is all about having fun, not meeting certain quotas (in my opinion, at least)!\n\n**Fandoms:**\n\nAlright, here's the thing. I'm fine with setting the story in a fandom world, maybe even including in passing some canon characters, but I would *much rather* we both use an OC or two. That being said, here are some that I'm willing to work with!\n\n* Dragon Age\n* Mass Effect\n* Any of the Quantic Dream collection (This one will probably take a lot more discussion, so if it even catches your eye then we can talk about it in detail!)\n* Fallout\n* Persona (mostly 5)\n* Supernatural (the TV show)\n* There might be more but I can't think of any more off the top of my head\n\nI know that there wasn't really a clear plot here, I do have a few more specifically in mind but I don't want this post to be too long. If any of that interested you, comment below or send me a pm (I will respond to chats, but the best way to get to me is the other two). I do primarily use Discord as my platform for writing but I can be persuaded to move elsewhere if I can get comfortable with the formatting. Oh, and if you made it past the \"no smut\" rule and still read this far, in your message tell me your favorite thing to eat for breakfast so I know you actually read through my post!\n\nI hope to hear from some people soon!",

            "selftext": "I've been in bed for awhile now, sadly. Last week I was struck with the flu and after finally recovering two days ago, I visited family only to get hit with a stomach virus. So I've really been unable to do much besides watch movies, play games, and eat bland foods. \n\nYesterday, though, I had a very interesting dream. One that I was sad that it was left so open ended. Then I thought, it may be fun to have someone help me recreate these stories while finding the ending I desire! So I gathered all the random bits of writing I did for whatever dream I had that morning and now I'm writing them here! They will be edited/added to so it makes more sense, but these are all dreams I've had before based of of strange, random things. \n\nI'm searching for someone long term who would be interested in a plot-heavy story and can write 4 sentences or more. I'll try to mirror your reply length. \n\n1 - (Urban Sci-fi) \nYou are a detective who has been asked to look into the suspective creation of illegal robots. Normally, only one or two companies are allowed to create these things since they were given permission by national leaders. So long as they follow the ethical and restrictive rules and robots are locked to these guidelines. However, as you look into an abandoned factory the perpetrators were last seen, you find a woman asleep in one of the broken down laboratories. Though something isn't right about her. She doesn't have any warm blood or pulse yet her eyes immediately open. \n((Recommended character: Someone who's a bit cocky but for good reason. Very talented and intelligent, but prefers to keep to themselves. Isn't really big on having someone depending on them personally.))\n\n2 - (Superhero)\nYou were in an abusive home. Your parents were never kind to you and it left you feeling shy/isolated from the community as well. One night, you decide enough is enough and you run away from home. Only for them to chase after you. Running into the woods, you could feel anxiety build as they grew close. However, just then a flash of white flies above you. It's hard to believe this, but a girl your age grabs you by the hands and the two of you begin to soar into the night sky. She smiles kindly, promising you a better life as she takes you far from the dreaded house and into a new city altogether. She stays with you for a couple of days as protection until finally a kind couple find you. You never see the girl again as years go by. \n\nAs you've reached adulthood, you've become a big shot and never even have to think about being poor again. While you aren't the mayor, people will sometimes say you're the one who truly owns the city. Recently, there's been talk of how crime has decreased less and less each month due to a masked vigilante. Rumors and pictures show a young woman who has large angelic wings similar to what you saw that fateful night. Is she the same one? \n((Recommended character: In my dream, it went a little dark in the end with the Protagonist in this prompt being a bit more on the dark side. First for being a secret leader of the mafia in the city and secondly, being obsessed/infatuated with the angel hero. This isn't needed, but I'd love to keep it that way?))\n\n3 - (Urban Fantasy)\nYou are a powerful demon lord who controls your own dimension full of servants and those who were thrown in as punishment of crimes. A few wander in that try to claim your throne, but you demolish them into a crisp. One day, a wicked sorceress enters your lair and requests your help with a small issue she has. There's another mage who has bested her time and again for years now. She asks for your help and in return, she will grant you a very old/evil relic that was banished by the elder demons long ago. With that, you can finally claim more dimensions and becoming the Lord of Lords. Seems like an easy enough gig.\n\nHowever, during your battle with this good-hearted mage, she pulls out an ultimate spell as an act of survival. Neither of you were sure what it would do until you wake up in a soft bed and a simple room. Your body feels weak, but not because of fatigue or sickness. Just doesn't feel right. That's when you turn towards the mirror and look with absolute horror . \n((Recommended Character: What you turn in to doesn't really matter. In my dreams, it was a large stuffed animal, but it can be whatever. Even a human who has to learn how to function on Earth.))\n\n4 - (Fantasy)\n((This one depends on gender))\nYou've always found the princess of your kingdom to be a beautiful woman. Not like the other townsfolk  where they simply compliment her features or how she would occasionally be generous towards the \"little people\". You actually could find yourself falling head over heels for her. Last year, as she was touring the village, the two of you had a moment to talk after accidentally spilling cider on her. She laughed it off and with a small conversation you realized how compatible the two of you could be. You swore she blushed before saying goodbye. Unfortunately, you're just a simply citizen who could never ever get close to the palace. Even if you took a job, 90% never meet the royals besides a quick glance. \n\nLuck turns out to be on your side when the rumors start flowing in. Since the princess is turning eighteen, she will be taking on more duties to prepare her role as future Queen. She will require her own set of soldiers who will protect her on ambassador trips and extra handmaidens to tend to her throughout the day. This is the chance you've been waiting for. \n\nUnfortunately, the job suited \"best for your gender\" has already been taken. The only thing left is the one that was opposite. You then have the clever idea of disguising yourself as the opposite gender in order to be guaranteed a job close to your crush. However, do you tell her immediately of who you truly are and risk being thrown in jail? Or do you wait and grow close to her before she is set up in an arranged marriage? ((Recommended Character: If you're playing a woman, you'd be acting the role of a male guard. If you're a man, the role of a female servant. Perhaps acting very shy around the princess at first is the only thing I would recommend?))\n\n\n5 - (Urban Fantasy)\nAs far as you know, you're the only vampire in at least the giant city. Sure your family counts as others, but they have been long either hunted down or ran off into various parts of the world. It's really only been you with everyone else a simple human. Except your \"best friend\", the Supernatural Huntress. Every month or so, she will somehow find you in an isolated place while giving those typical \"heroic words\" about finally defeating you and ending the reign of vampiric terror. You never understood this. You just want to have a good time and occasionally drink some random cutie's blood. Still, it gives you some relief to the boredom and you always tease/rile her up only to escape right at the end. \n\nOne night, you hear a strange knock at your door. You're curious as no one has ever found your home so when you open it, there's a surprise. A human corrupted with hollowed eye sockets and purple branch-like veins attacks you. He has surprising strength and it doesn't help when two more of his friends bust into home to join in. You have no choice but to run away. What are these things? And why did they come after you? Is there any place that's safe as you look for answers. \n\nBegrudgingly, it may be your nemesis as the two of you realize you both have an equal enemy to team up again. \n((Recommended Character: A cocky and chill person who just prefers to party while looking for anything to clear up boredom. Of course this may change during the intense adventure they take. Also, doesn't have to be vampire but something Supernatural.))\n\n\nHave your own prompt that sorta goes with the vibes of my stories? I'd be interested in knowing them! I normally take the reigns on everything but your character but I don't mind going opposite. I will say I'm a big fan of adventure, drama and dark themes. Oh, and please only those 18 and above? \n\nHopefully these aren't too confusing and I'm always happy to give answers to questions here or whatever platform we end up going with. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to get back to sipping tea/water and eating plain rice.",

I do want a fairly literate person and someone who can be detailed but also understands that when I get writers block it goes away after awhile. So my idea is blackmail.\nYoure character was a chubby nerd who was bullied by my character. But she didn't realize what it did to him. So he blackmails her somehow into sleeping with him. Now he's turned himself into a good looking guy and into a successful person. They start seeing each other but slowly it starts to turn to love and he discovers how depressed she was through school and still is and he can't help but want to help and so they fall in love and bond and yeah. Then they get into a fight and then they miss each other. I want you to think sappy love story!!! Kiss in the pouring rain!!! Lead her up the staircase!!! Oh god, I'm now excited.",

And I\u2019m on the hunt for a long-term partner. \n\nI will go ahead and say that I mostly write on Discord, and only in third person. I love doing multiple paragraphs, as I\u2019m quite descriptive, too. (On average I probably send 3-4 but honestly it varies!) \n\nI\u2019m in EST, and am available mostly during the day on weekdays, maybe occasionally at night but typically not real late. It\u2019s important my partner is patient, as I\u2019ve met people who definitely are not. I\u2019ve been treated with anger and blocked for taking a couple of hours to respond. So this is a heads up, I can\u2019t always do back and forth, (there are times I can) therefore I may be slow at times. Life happens, I need someone who understands. (: \n\nI\u2019m asking you\u2019re 18+ in case of adult situations and themes. I\u2019m an adult. I can\u2019t bend on this one.\n\nSo, some of my favorite genres are high/medieval fantasy (think magic and Dungeons and Dragons) or low/medieval fantasy (think no magic, vikings, pirates, etcetera). I also like post apocalyptic slice of life but my weaker points might be sci-fi or regular slice of life. \n\nI\u2019m not a DM and I\u2019m not looking for a DM. I think it would be awesome for us to build something together that we can both enjoy. I\u2019m pretty down the earth and definitely not about drama and disrespect, so definitely looking for someone similar. \n\nThank you! \n\nFeel free to message me. Let\u2019s talk before trading platform information and see how things go.",

I'd like to really build off the world and figure out a direction to go with anybody interested! \n\nIf you'd like a picture of my character, let me know.

Stuff happens in life, and you get side tracked easily. \n\nWhat's up whomever is reading this, I hope it finds you in good times, and if not; I hope good tidings come your way shortly. My name is Nick, I've been roleplaying for roughly 9 years, close to 10 now. I'm currently looking for more people to Roleplay with, as I'm trying to rekindle my love for it, along with a few other things. \n\nOne thing I should mention; as I do with all my serious posts, is that I try my best to make friends with whomever I'm roleplaying with. What's the point of doing a form of acting with strangers if you cant sit down and have a metaphorical coffee with them now and again yea? \n\nWhat I look for in a roleplay partner isnt really set in stone, it depends on the type of roleplay we decide to do. My favorites tend to be those that descend from medieval themes and such, but I tend to sometimes do slice-of-life, modern, Sci-Fi, and more recently; horror.\n\nI dont mind roleplaying with either gender; or whatever you may identify as. My only requirement is that if you yourself wish to involve smut in a roleplay, atleast be 18 or over. If not, then bloody combat or wholesome romance is what will happen.\n\nThis might come across as toxic to some people, I mean; cmon. It's 2019, everything is toxic. \n\nIf you find interest and want to talk, or even rp; then feel free to message me on Reddit and we can talk. I mainly roleplay on Discord however.\n\nIf you managed to read down here, then congratulations; you earned a gold star. Take it!\u2b50",

I know I would like there to be some sort of romantic element, which often includes smut which I dont mind but don't want it to be the center of the story. I was thinking something like two Tenno exploring ruins and fighting in whatever their main chosen warframe is. Im fine with story bending and would love to craft a story! A few things I like in a roleplay is a emphasis on communication and making sure were both getting what we want out of the roleplay! Im on the East Coast, and enjoy a few posts a day often around 2 paragraphs. I do enjoy dark themes and such so 18+ please, and so on. So if anything of this sounds interesting Message me on here and we can talk some stuff over before moving to Discord! :D",

So a little about me, I am a guy who\u2019s above the age of 20 so nsfw or adult themes are alright with me but I will always make sure my writing partner is above the age of 18 and we both have a chat about it before hand to make sure we are both on the same page about it. \n\nI\u2019ve been a writer since middle school and I really wanna stretch my writing legs with this, get something going that could be long lasting with romance or action or anything really! I have a OC I have made specifically for this and I will tell you about him in a moment.\n\nFor starters, we can world build before starting. And I mean we can get very detailed or be very general and think on the fly, I\u2019m very adaptable. \n\nSecondly, my character I\u2019ll be writing as is Darius Alvetto. The royal protector to a now dead kingdom. He had lain dormant for thousands of years and for some reason the flame of life had reignited within him and he awakens to his home being desolate and forgotten. He ventures out into this new world, looking to find out what happened to his home and what this new world has in store for this Knight. Of course there is more I can reveal about him but this should be enough for now. \n\nAnyway, if this has caught your eye please shoot a response or a pm! I\u2019ll be happy to answer any questions you have, don\u2019t wanna leave any of my writing partners in the dark.",

With that being said I've been roleplaying for about \u00bd a year now. Any literacy is fine with me! I like doing a lot of slice of life (real life) or supernatural type role plays. I do enjoy romance in the mix. I have recently started vet school, so sometimes I may be busier than others. That being said, I aim for at least an everyday type of response from myself. I totally understand if things come up in your life to where you can't reply for a while, but it would be nice just to get a heads up, so I don't get the wrong idea of you ghosting me. I would also really like to become friends through the process, but it's not a must.\n\nI only use discord for rp'ing, so that's a must if you want to rp with me. Let me know if you all have ideas for the plot or so and we can always try to implement it.  \n\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you.",

            "selftext": "I would love to do at least one spooky/horror themed RP this October and I thought this would be the best place to advertise. Ideally, I would like to create an atmospheric horror setting with lots of suspense and psychological elements similar to games like Silent Hill and Resident Evil.\n\nI know what I just described is a combination of genres that are very popular and leaves a lot of details to be decided on but for now all of my ideas are pretty up in the air. What my partner is interested in and comfortable with will help decide where we take it. I mention Silent Hill specifically in this advertisement but whether it takes place in the same universe or just heavily draw inspiration from it is up for discussion. I personally think the universe is untouched and ambiguous enough to set an RP in but I'd also have a lot of fun with a completely original idea that simply includes the same kind of horror.  \nIf we do take inspiration from any of the games, I should mention that 3, 2, and 1 are my favorites in that order. As for Resident Evil inspired stuff, the first 2 (especially the remake) are the ideal ones for roleplaying in my mind. Again, whether we are actually roleplaying within the universe or just taking heavy inspo from these games is up to you.\n\nHere are some of my personal roleplay preferences that might help with narrowing down a compatible partner.\n\n1. My main character is most likely going to be a female. This is for my own personal comfort and will not factor into the RP that much. Your character's gender does not matter to me and as for secondary characters and NPCs and such, I am fine with playing any gender.\n2. I exclusively RP on Discord because it is one of the only formats I'm comfortable with anymore and would prefer our conversation to move there at some point.\n3. Prefer a paragraph to multi-paragraph writing length\n\nI am comfortable with gore and just about any of the dark and mature themes that you might come up with for an RP in this setting and have no major reservations at this point but if you have any triggers or content you are uncomfortable with, you should definitely share that with me. Since I am not giving us a solid idea in the ad I expect a fair bit of discussion anyways and am happy to hear any info you might like to provide me early on that would make roleplaying easier for you. :)\n\nAnd that's about it for now. You can hit me up in DMs with plot ideas, questions, general information, or even just your Discord tag and I will get back to you. Thanks and I hope to start my RP October on here! :3",

On the first week, four men and six women will join the \"show\" and get to know one another. They will have a week to become familiar with one another, and the moment that ends, the first rose ceremony begins!\n\nAt the rose ceremony, the gender with the least members will give out roses. On the first week, this will be the guys, as the ratio to women is 4:6. Two of the women will go home, and the next week, two new men will arrive. If you are not given a rose, you either have the option of leaving the roleplay or creating a new character. Either way is perfectly fine and perfectly acceptable. If you aren't having fun anymore, no one blames you.\n\nThe show continues as long as everyone feels they need to establish connections. The formula repeats each week. At the end of it all, everyone will decide whether they want to continue their relationships, get engaged, or end it all. \n\nWhen the season is over, we will all regroup and decide if we want to restart the roleplay again with new characters. Since this server is brand new, we'll see where it goes. Who knows!\n\nThis is a new server, and the hope is that it remains within ten-ish members. If you are interested in being apart of it, please PM me with a writing sample prepared! We are looking for *third person past-tense writers.*\n\n**We hope to see you on the beach!**",

I'm looking for someone who can match my writing length, as I understand not every message sent will be a novel; long when necessary and I understand when the scene is dialogue heavy the posts won't be as long. I don't have perfect grammar, but it just needs to be readable. I enjoy descriptive writing, and I prefer to write in 3rd person lately. I'm not looking for someone who will be on 24/7, but I also don't want to do one message a day. This will deal with some heavy themes, if you are sensitive to certain topics, you'd probably want to steer clear of this. I am in PST and honestly prefer that my partner be no further from me than EST. My main method of roleplay is through discord as I can be much more organized. I utilize face claims as well as detailed backgrounds. PM me if you're interested and we can see if things will work. Thanks!\n\nNow for the prompt:\nY/C and M/C grew up in a small, everyone knows everyone, town and began dating towards the end of their eighth grade and stayed together throughout the end of high school. M/C was a year older than Y/C though because he was held back in grade school. As they neared graduation, Y/C found out she was pregnant. M/C panicked, left her and after graduation he disappeared, deleted any social media and changed his phone number. Soon after a rumor began to spread around that she was sleeping around and that's why M/C had left. She went along with it because it was easier than to admit she was abandoned by M/C. Later that fall she gave birth to a baby girl (name up to you). Five years have passed and he is in town again, though he kept it quiet. His grandfather had passed away recently and he is home to help with his mother who is having a rough time. His mother raised him and his 16 year old sister. Y/C heard the news of his grandfather, and despite what happened to them, his mother kept a relationship with Y/C as she saw her as her own daughter, Y/C decided to pay his mom a visit. M/C was out of the house at the time doing some grocery shopping for his mom when he walks through the door and see Y/C, his mom, and sister sitting at the dining table. \r\n\nSide note: don't ask why the child is a girl, I have no real reason to it other than I like the idea. You will have the choice of what happens though (i.e. she keeps the baby, doesn't, baby dies, etc. I like a good curve ball. Also Y/C can be in a relationship, engaged or whatever, but the ultimate goal is for the two to reconcile).\n\nTo show me you've read the entire thing, please answer the following question:\nWhat is your favorite dad joke?

I'm using the same format as my last request because it worked and got me some awesome partners. The only difference is the character ideas section.\n\nHere's a quick list of what I'm looking for:\u00a0\n\n- someone comfortable playing a male main character.\u00a0\n- a roleplay written in the third person, past or present tense.\u00a0\n- a roleplay where nsfw content isn't a priority. I am not looking for gratuitous anything.\n- a partner who, like me, has a not-so secret soft spot for some form of romance in a roleplay.\u00a0\n- a partner who enjoys writing a few paragraphs per reply. I need that immersion and character thoughts; it's my favourite part about roleplaying.\n\nThat's about it, I think. Here's a list of character ideas/plot bunnies I would like to play. I tend to stick with the standard apocalyptic, fantasy, medieval, modern, and/or any mix of those genres.\u00a0\n\n- She was created for destructive purposes; a living weapon. A power-hungry sorcerer and his conniving apprentice spent their working years creating her. The sorcerer fantasized about enacting his revenge on all the Kingdoms who ridiculed him beyond redemption due to his methods, and his beliefs. They simply didn't know better, and he was set on proving to everyone the mistake they'd done underestimating him. And it works. The pair take over not one, but two kingdoms, bringing them to their knees in a matter of days. She's evil incarnate, merciless, and unwavering. One night, a storm crashes down on the land and amidst her reign of destruction, a lightning bolt pierces through her body, and she disppears.\u00a0\n\nHours later, a woman wakes up in a field of blooming flowers with no recollection of who she is. All she has to her name are the clothes on her back and a hastily scrawled note in her hand with the words 'There is no redemption'.\n\n- The story goes that when a witch is born, a familiar is born at the same time, and they're destined to cross paths and bond. Well, it's been over 300 hundred years and this witch is starting to think that this legend is as bogus as wearing socks with sandals.\u00a0\n\n- Her days are numbered, this illness isn't about to go away, so she's set out to make the best of the rest of her life.\u00a0\n\n- It's the apocalypse and this group of people are the only means to her survival. Folks don't get along, tensions are high, and there are a lot of zombies to be slayed.\u00a0\n\nIf any of these interest you, do shoot me a message and give me some information about you and what piqued your interest! I left the other role very open-ended because I want my partner to enjoy playing whomever they'd like, so tell me about your character, too!",

Just know it involves a seedy bar, a murder, and some banter.  If you like crime/romance/drama in a 90's new york urban area, DM if you're interested. \n\nI've posted here before but just a bit about what I'm looking for in a partner: \n\nYou need to be at least 18+ no exceptions, if you're 20+ that would be great. 22M here. Be at least semi-lit, so able to  write a paragraph no problem. Comfortable with writing in 3rd person,  no \\*actions\\*. I dont expect perfect tenses, I tend to flip flop between  present and passed tense so no worries. Not a fan of \"Oh woe is me\"  characters, self harm, or mary sue's when it comes to OC's. I also enjoy  OOC chatter and getting to know my partners.",

Who is to say, that the person you are supposed to be with, isn't picked at the start of your life? Soulmates will always find each other, despite how long it may take.*\n\nGood morning, Good evening and Good night,\n\nMy name is Freya, and I have been an active role player for about 5 years or so. I took a break a while back (due to a relationship, where he didn't really understand or like the idea of me writing with other men), but as that is now well and truly over, I would love to find some cool, talented, easy going people to create with.\n\nI am a 25 year old English girl currently living in Edinburgh for the next year or so due to work. And let me tell you, this is a City that was made to get your creative juices flowing - just ask JK Rowling!\n\nI am not super strict at all, unlike some posts I do see on here, but what I do ask is the following:\n\n* **Be polite, civil and courteous**\n* **Understand that IRL happens, and I cannot be available 24 hours a day**\n* **Write at least 1 reply a day, I myself have the perk of a laptop in front of me for most of the day, so can be around quite frequent, but I for sure do not expect the same**\n* **You be over 18, and Male (or willing to write as one) - I am not into NSFW with women on here, so please do not try to talk me into it**\n\nAs I have mentioned NSFW, I want to stress that this is not solely why I am here, but if it flows natural to the story, I am here for it!\n\nI am a super seasonal person, so at the moment something focused on Autumn or the Holidays would be ideal for me. Touching on the Soulmate thing, it is something that is super interesting to me, and I find myself wondering on how that idea can be worked into a story. I want this to be a joint effort, so unfortunately do not have long winded prompts to woo you with.\n\nI only use Discord, but am happy to talk over Reddit for a while before moving over. Servers drive me nuts ;) because, like most young ladies, I live for organisation.\n\nSo that's that, I will stop rambling, but if I do grab your fancy, and you want to create something delicious, then please, come and find me.\n\nFreya :)",

            "selftext": "Hey guys!  Guess what, I'm still *looking4trouble* haha. Trying to find a happy medium I decided to make a simple yet extensive thread. It shows not only my preferences but also hopefully will expose all the possible differences between us. Under \"Compatibility Check\" I'm highlighting those aspects that I found me and potential partners were sometimes not matching at in the past.\n\nGo ahead, check this out and lemme know if you're one of those rare individuals who belongs to the breed of *collaborative writers*. Who instinctively knows how much and how detailed to write in each scene. How to use \"show not tell\" in the most optimal way. Who can deliver all the true personalities and those raw emotions of adult men, not boys. Challenged by sometimes extreme circumstances and forced to show their vulnerable side.\n\nLet's mix all the clich\u00e9 with the most unique we can think of and write stories that people would pay to see in the movies!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Yes Please**\n\n\u2714     thrilling yet realistic action with heartbreaking, well dosed drama as well as intense but organic MxM romance\n\n\u2714    creating large casts of  tangible, multi dimensional characters and rediscovering them in new settings/verses\n\n\u2714    main characters that are (or at least appear/aspire to be) physically and mentally capable and confident manly guys, acting accordingly to their age and life experience; men who in life and romance naturally fall into equal x equal dynamics\n\n\u2714    decent size posts with length adjusted to what scene calls for; rich in detail and giving insight into character's mind\n\n\u2714    exploring various themes and genres with the right combo of character development, exciting plot and some world building, while leaning towards modern/realistic vibe\n\n\u2714    open, sincere communication with a long-term partner and frequent OOC chatter to keep the spark alive!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Not Interested In**\n\n\u2718    situations/characters that don't feel believable; realism is important even in \"unreal\" verses\n\n\u2718    not well fleshed out personalities or making characters act OOC\n\n\u2718    weak/needy/feminine appearing males as main characters, predetermined caregiver x cared-for dynamics and anything that might seem  \"too immature\" or \"too angsty\"\n\n\u2718    overusing dark/heavy themes (like suicide, health issues, addictions) by making them become one of the main traits of a character/story\n\n\u2718    letting rper's mood or knowledge affect their post\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Compatibility Check \u32e1**\n\nHow are we doing so far? Do you feel like we're seeking and offering similar things? Let me touch on few spots we might vary at, to help you figure that out!\n\nI don't look for a partner for a single rp or single genre/theme. I'd like us to share general interests and enjoy writing multiple stories, eventually adjusted to our \"current cravings\". And even though I don't mind making new, additional characters each time, I'd like us to grow to love some \"core group\" of them. That we can rediscover in AUs/alternative paths etc.\n\nThat's why it's so important for me to not only use NPCs and typical side characters to \"fill the world\" our mains live in, but to create at least few main characters. Or at least a good number of decently developed \"sides\" who could turn into mains one day.\n\nIf you're game for such a long lasting rp-bromance, please note that even though I very much enjoy unreal verses or some fantasy/sci fi elements in my rps, I am leaning towards  \"nowadays reality\". Advanced tech? Apocalyptic world? Urban fantasy or futuristic elements? Maybe even deep space, historical or high fantasy world? All that could be my thing, but my go-to is modern/realistic mix of action+romance+drama.\n\nOne last thing. But in a way most important one. *Characters*. At the end of the day, whatever the verse we explore and whatever the plot we develop... the fictional, yet in our minds not any less *living and breathing* humans who experience all the hardship and happiness our brains produce, are the most important part of the story. And for me to enjoy ours? All main characters have to give that vibe of a physically and mentally realistic, masculine, mature man. I will happily elaborate on this one!\n\n**Still on board? Awesome! I hope by now you can tell that I'd like to meet people who will not just \"try to meet my requirements\". I hope they will simply** ***share*** **similar preferences. So they can enjoy my writing as much as I hope to enjoy theirs. If you think we have potential? Go ahead and PM me, share what you think we have in common or if that's easier, just list the things we vary at. Hope to hear from you soon!**",

            "selftext": "Hello there. I would love to have a story we can make together with the both of us constantly making ideas or character plots. I'd love for us to have development for our characters. I always wanted to do this idea but I was too afraid of rejection because it doesn't seem too exciting. \n\n\n**Basis of Plot-** I had an idea of a adult and child who travel the land together. Slowly they begin to adapt into a parent and child dynamic. I would rather be the adult here, and inside we can discuss plot points of the how, and where. Another concept would be two brothers or two sisters by this I don't mean by blood entirely but we can have them be adoptive brothers or just warming up to one another as they go on about surviving. Sisters works as well! If you haven't noticed yet I love the impending theme of family. \n\n\n**Requirements-** Quite frankly, I'm not too picky of a person. I do have one rule above all. Please try to understand that I am busy at times but when I am, I always let you know what's happening and when I will be back. Secondly, I love when someone can match with me with a novella style of writing. I prefer quality over quantity but, two paragraphs at the very least would settle with me. Like I mentioned above as well, I would like us *both* to come up with ideas as writers for certain arcs, and ideas on a enemy or whatever surprise you like to toss. It won't be all you, because I love to brainstorm things as well. Just **don't** speak for my character that's a big annoyance for me. Lastly, I'd like to mention how I don't use discord I don't have it and kik the word count is too little. I usually use Google Docs or we can use Reddit. \n\n\nI am passionate for lore and writing. I give it my all! So I hope you try to add in some effort as well. It can keep us going a long way. I promise I'm not uptight or serious I'm pretty laid-back as you get to know me. If you wish for the ooc chat to be only limited to RP Discussion than I am totally fine with that. It is also your choice if you wish to have a character sheet or not. I have a character that I wish to use but has been created already. I'd only tamper with the sheet and modernize him a little.\n\n\nYou can choose whichever race you'd like and the backstory of your choice. All I ask is that we communicate because it will get us quite far. I hope I don't let any of you down. Oh yeah, and the darker the RP the better. (Not really, I just love a Dark RP.)\n\n\nI will not answer Reddit Comments. Message me Directly and be sure to include which dynamic you what our characters as, your RP platform you would like, and whether or not Dark RP bothers you any. I can leave it out if it makes you uncomfortable! Make sure to tell me about yourself as well. Just make sure you made an attempt to try to read all of this.",

            "selftext": "Hello to all of you lovely lurkers and fellow roleplay subreddit subscribers! I\u2019m back again with another post because I\u2019m currently looking for some new partners! Autumn is upon us and the days are growing colder. It is officially the best time for curling up with a cup of hot coffee and writing a good story.\n\nBefore I explain some of the ideas I have in mind, let me elaborate a little bit on myself. I\u2019m a 22 year old female who enjoys playing both genders and in most cases can write multiple characters as well. I prefer to write MxF stories but will consider other pairings if the story warrants it. The only thing I\u2019m not flexible on is literacy. I write in 3rd person, past tense, and expect my partners to enjoy adhering to the same. As far as length goes, I average anywhere from 4-6 paragraphs but am capable of doing much more when the situation warrants it. These \u201crequirements\u201d are just to ensure we are as compatible as possible.\n\nI am perfectly fine with NSFW content of all natures as long as it is actually fits into the situation. If you\u2019re looking for someone who writes pure smut, we probably won\u2019t work well together. \n\nWith my boring yet obligatory introduction out of the way, let me get into some of the prompts I have in mind:\n\n  - **Witches, Warlocks, &amp; Psychics, oh my! :** With Halloween approaching, I\u2019ve really been craving something that plays off the idea of witches and warlocks in modern times. I\u2019m also interested in anything involving clairvoyants, ghosts, specters, or anything else in that genre that you can imagine! An example pairing for this would be the tradition X-Files dynamic, a believer and a skeptic. (Except in this case, the believer may have abilities of their own.) I would also be interested in almost any horror prompt you can think of, just shoot. \n\n  - **Historical:** After recently re-watching The Hateful 8, my interest in Westerns has been reignited! I\u2019m not looking for anything canon but if you have any ideas ranging from the pure golden age \u201cWild Wild West\u201d to the 1920s, I\u2019m your gal. I also have a looooong idea of my own that I\u2019m not going to type out here, so inquire further if that sounds up your alley!\n\n  -**Slice of Life (With a Twist)**: Though it is typically not my thing, I\u2019ve been craving something along the lines of a typical slice of life romance with a variant to keep it interesting. Are you a killer and I\u2019m a victim you\u2019ve been stalking? Are we a pair of detectives investigating aforementioned killer? Are you a cult leader and I one of your newest followers? Am I the mysterious new girl in town with a dark secret? Are we in an arranged marriage? Any of the scenarios I described could be reversed or alternated on. **(Seriously, cult roleplays are a craving!)**\n\n  - **Renaissance Misadventures:** I don\u2019t have an exact prompt fleshed out for this but I\u2019ve always had an interest in the Italian Renaissance. Assassins, philosophers, soldiers, and cultural revolution; there\u2019s just so many options. A maestro and prodigy dynamic comes to mind.\n\n**Fandoms:** I\u2019m not looking to follow any canon to a T right now but if you\u2019re looking for a fandom role-play or just want to get a better idea of the themes I\u2019m best at writing, I figured I would list a few more things below:\n  - Red Dead Redemption\n  - The Witcher\n  - A Song of Ice and Fire\n  - Days Gone (I love apocalypse tropes)\n  - The Twilight Zone (short stories, anyone?)\n  - Labyrinth\n  - Annihilation (UFO contact sights, research scientists, and black ops) \n  - Tanis/Archive 81/The Black Tapes\n  - Silent Hill\n  - Many, many more that I\u2019m sure I\u2019m leaving out!\n\n\nWoooo, that was a long one! I tried to sum everything up as short as I could but I have a lot of ideas right now and it\u2019s hard not to ramble. If there\u2019s anything I forgot to add that you think would be of interest, don\u2019t hesitate to send me an orange envelope! The worst I can do is say no or suggest some changes, right? I\u2019m also available on Discord and Google Docs.\n\nCiao!",

            "selftext": "Hi there! My name is Bailey and I\u2019m in need of some new partners, as I am always trying to expand. I use kik, discord, or reddit for my roleplay. As for what I\u2019m looking for, I\u2019m not clear on what I\u2019m looking for plot-wise, but I can tell you this: \n\nI love romance, and it\u2019s a definite must, whether it\u2019s FxF or MxF, and I always play female. I\u2019m into drama, action, dark themes, supernatural, slice of life, horror, adventure, and pretty much all of the above. My imagination has troubles when it comes to fantasy and magic, though. \n\nI\u2019m pretty much willing to do any genre or plots that you may have, and if neither of us have a fleshed out idea it\u2019s always fun to create one together and continue creating together as we go along! \n\nLet me also mention this: I\u2019m not looking for a sex-based roleplay, but enjoy including it into the story as it fits, with an appropriate build. \n\nMy preference for style is 1st person, but I can do 3rd as well. I don\u2019t care about post length, and think a paragraph is just fine. I cannot find 2+ paragraphs fun, as I feel like it hinders the partners\u2019 abilities to move the story along. Although, when starting a new roleplay I can definitely see where length is necessary. It\u2019s just easier to bounce off of replies when they\u2019re shorter, especially with dialogue. \n\nIf you have any prompts, plots, or ideas you\u2019d like to discuss or roleplay, send me a message so we can get to creating something together. I hope you took time to read this, I tried to keep it short, so if you have any further comments/questions, message me! Thanks, Bailey.",

Ghosts and ghouls of every age, you are invited to spend Halloween night frolicking in the wooded area on the outskirts of Aurora Springs. Behind a mask or some face paint...it's uncertain what that individual's motives are. Are they here to cause mischief or to bless the night with treats of their own? Arrive at the indicated spot on the map provided with your invitation and follow the guiding path that will lead you to the party site...with luck.   \n   \nSound like something you're interested in? Wonderful! Let me tell you a bit about Aurora Springs then!\n\n Aurora Springs is the name of a hidden town located somewhere in the Rocky Mountain area. In this beautiful landscape, men and women have found a place to call their own. A home, a place to work or even study, made friends or...met someone who is much more than just that. Now...not everyone in this town is human. You'd be surprised who...or what creatures you find wandering around the streets of Aurora.  \n\n\n**We are a slice of life roleplay community filled with talented writers that has been around for a year now. A chill, welcoming 18+ scene. As in, all members are and must be 18 years or older to roleplay here. Why? Well, because we don't want a bunch of immature children bouncing off the walls here!**  \nTo join and learn more, click the link below!  \n [https://discord.gg/2Wvz25R](https://discord.gg/2Wvz25R)",

A bit about me, and we can discuss more out of character, is that I\u2019m over the age of thirty, from the East Coast of the United States, and employed in a steady, but slow, full-time job. You\u2019ll find that I\u2019m most available during the day, and \u2026 I think that\u2019s all I want to share here \u2026 for now.\n\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019m looking for in a roleplay.\n\n**Deep, Meaningful Character Development.** I do not want our characters to be without flaw. One of my favorite parts of roleplaying is watching characters we love grow into the people we want them to be \u2026 or in all seriousness, watching them grow into the people that they want to be. Let\u2019s be honest, when a roleplay is going well, the characters practically write themselves.\n\n**Deep, Meaningful World Development.** I want our world to feel vibrant and alive. I know this isn\u2019t necessarily worthy of a paragraph, but this is extremely important to me. I love, love, love world development and love building the intricacies of the world. As an example, does magic exist? If it does, what are its limits? Etc.\n\nHere are a few other things that are important to me, that don\u2019t require a full paragraph.\n\n* I require that all of my partners be over the age of 18.\n* Bonus points if you want \u2026\n   * Slow-burn romance.\n   * Reference imagery.\n   * Out of character friendship.\n* I **do not** limit myself to theme / setting as I feel **Deep, Meaningful Character Development** and **Deep, Meaning World Development** can happen in any story, but ...\n* I **do not** roleplay fandoms, although I am okay with pulling inspiration.\n\nIf any of this sounds interesting to you, let me know and let's connect on Discord!",

It\u2019s just nice to interact with someone as if you\u2019re having a real conversation instead of trying to react for everyone. I think it brings out the true emotions. \n\nThe title pretty much says the basicness of it. It\u2019s set in the Mayans M.C. universe with the main characters being an OC female and Angel Reyes as they main male. If there is a secondary set of characters you as my partner would like to explore I am completely open to it. \n\nAs for the plot I don\u2019t have one set in stone. I\u2019m hoping someone out there is ready to have a deep discussion of where we\u2019d like this to go. At some point I can only assume some general Mayans shenanigans will come into play and I hope you\u2019re up to that. \n\nIf you have any questions please feel free to message me. To begin with this will be reddit based until we see that we\u2019re going to click. After that we can discuss a platform to move to. \n\nThank you for your tome. Have a wonderful day!",

            "selftext": "Roleplay Theme; So I\u2019ve been bored, and I wanted to try a theme where my character resurrects a stranger by accident, and somehow falls in love with them. Here is one of the scenarios that fit this Theme, that I typed up kinda quickly.\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nTL;DR : A girl with magic attends a strangers funeral just to see her crush, and instead, accidentally resurrects the corpse of said stranger. (If you do not agree with this prompt specifically but like the concept, then I have many ideas! Just feel free to ask)\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\nBasically, my character \u201cDakota\u201d is a girl, nearing her 20th birthday, and has found out that any time she thinks too much or feels a certain emotion, strange things happen, that she can\u2019t stop nor begin on command. \n\nOver winter break, she hears that a funeral will be hosted for someone she doesn\u2019t know, a person named (Your character). (They can be around 18-50) However the only reason she will attend will be to see her long time crush, Cole. So she attends, and attempts to talk with Cole. And that flukes, so she sits in the back out of respect. She might as well not leave, right? During the funeral, she gets light headed, and blacks out multiple times. Many things happen throughout her weird episode, which is due to her trying super hard to sustain her magic in public to the point where it\u2019s crippling her vital functions.\n\nAfterwards, around a few minutes after the ceremony, she finds herself alone in the large church, peering at the coffin. (The coffin can be open or closed, that is up to you!) She sees that many people have left flowers, so she takes out the white Camellia she has planned to put near the coffin. She looks over to the many different flowers, and decides to put the flower on the body (a sign of direct care for someone\u2019s death where she\u2019s from), since she already feels bad about blacking out during the funeral. Suddenly, she feels a buzz pulsate through her, a warm glow emit from the hand that clutched the flower and she drops it back onto the body, and closing the coffin.\n\nFrightened of anyone seeing her slight freak out, she attempts to scurry off, before the doors of the church lock, and the coffin begins to shake...\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\n\nHello! I\u2019m Ava, a junior in college, and a 5 month roleplayer! Currently, I\u2019m finally getting some downtime, and need a fun way to spend it. \n\nI will accept any gender, any, to take up this role. Any questions are welcome, and so is potential smut. However, you must be 18+, Details will only be given if you\u2019re interested in including smut.\n\n\u2022 Your character can have magic, just no god modding. It\u2019s not a must however. \n\n\u2022 OOC chat is very welcome! Just don\u2019t make it super frequent. Like an OOC chat every 6 replies or so. I want to be good friends with the person I\u2019m role playing with, not super super personal.\n\n\u2022 You can add OC\u2019s to the roleplay, and even play as Cole. Just make sure the story does not revolve around them.\n\n\u2022 Please be able to understand that I may not give you immediate responses. They will be within 24 hours. And if not, two days. Sometimes my schedule will be super cramped. Same for you! If you have a tight schedule, that\u2019s fine! Just warn me, and if you or I feel that there has been too much time taken away, then either could quit at any time without argument, just a warning so that it isn\u2019t ghosting.\n\n\u2022 I will not change any aspect of my character\u2019s gender or appearance. I would say the same for her magic, but that can be tampered with. Not completely taken away or changed. Her personality can also be tampered with, but no 180 changes. It needs to be similar to her original personality in some way.\n\n\u2022 I will only roleplay on Reddit or Discord. The comments of the post don\u2019t count either. It must be private in messages on Discord or Reddit.\n\n\u2022 Anything you wanna ask me? Go ahead! I\u2019m open to all ideas, just stick to this posts theme. Which is summoning someone from the dead by accident!",

            "selftext": "Hey there, thank you for taking a moment to read my request for role-playing partners!\n\n**A bit about me.**\n\nI am in my early 30\u2019s and have been role-playing on and off for fourteen years. Recently, I have had a few partners disappear (which happens) or lose interest (which also happens) and would love to find one or two more long-term partners to role-play with on a regular basis. \n\nIn regards to genre, I prefer Low Fantasy and Slice of Life, with a slow burn romantic twist. Even so, I may be up for anything if the plot is right. On that note, I do love and long for proper world building and character development. *If you are not up for spending any amount of time on that, and would rather jump head-first into the story, I may not be the right partner for you.*\n\nA few small notes of importance:\n\n* I only role-play on Discord.\n* I only role-play in third person.\n* I live within the ET time zone and am most available during the day.\n\n**A bit about you.**\n\nI am not picky when it comes to my partners, but I do ask that you have a love for role-playing and a sense of literacy. In my experience, role-plays aren\u2019t very fun unless both parties are wholly invested in the story. My favorite moments are when the characters seem to come alive and take over writing the story. \n\nOne last note, as I do enjoy including romance in my role-plays, I do make it a rule that my partners be at least 18 years old. This does not mean that smut or NSFW content has to exist.\n\n**A bit about us.**\n\nHere is what I expect ... I will be honest with you, and you will be honest with me.\n\nA few examples:\n\n* If either of us are not feeling each other as a partner, we will let the other know.\n* If either of us are not feeling the plot, we will let the other know.\n* If either of us are going to be gone for an extended period of time, or take a personal day, we will let the other know.\n\n\\~\\~\\~\n\nIf you are interested in seeing if we\u2019re compatible, hit me up with an orange envelope (private message **not** private chat). To prove that you\u2019ve read the post in its entirety, please include your favorite dad joke and your Discord username.",

            "selftext": "Hey all!\n\nI've always been drawn to a realistic-fiction type of roleplay but I've had some trouble finding roleplays that aren't entirely based on romance. I'm in the mood to have a roleplay that can stimulate me philosophically through characters and stories that allow for introspection and reflection on life. If you could imagine a roleplay story of Sartre's 'The Age of Reason' or any Murakami story, that'd kind of be the vibe I'm in search of! \n\nI draw a lot of my inspiration through music, and I came across this jazz lo-fi Youtube video that had a dimly lit diner as its thumbnail, and it got me in the mood for a moody type of roleplay involving characters who are strangers and happen to meet one day and talk about their lives - from the mundane to the more intimate subjects. I have no set direction for where I would want the story or roleplay to go, but I would prefer a partner who is a creative and literate writer that can express emotions, thoughts, and sentiments through their character(s) using the \"show don't tell\" kind of technique. It would also help to have a partner who can separate themselves from their character, and create/build character(s) with unique backgrounds and philosophies. \n\nA little about me... I've been roleplaying since 2012 and writing since 2007. I'm very expressive in my roleplay and although I prefer to write in third-person (and would prefer a partner who writes in third-person as well!), I'm able to convey the character's personalities and thoughts in a digestible and well-flowed manner. I like to emphasize the thought process of my characters, and try not to rely on just visual descriptions to make longer texts. My posts vary in length, but they are usually a few paragraphs. I normally use Discord as my method of roleplaying, with Google docs for side information such as character analyses or background information on the world/universe the roleplay is set in. \n\nI'm looking for a roleplaying and writing partner to the fullest extent of what defines a \"partner\" to be. I would appreciate a fellow writer who would enjoy collaborating on building not just a roleplay but a story together, through our character(s) and our writing. I would feel more comfortable having a RP partner who is 20+, and one who is open to mature and realistic themes. I've been on the roleplay scene for awhile, so I would also appreciate someone who is aware of the cliche character tropes that are often used in character creation in order to avoid typical/overused themes and characters. I don't mind my RP partner's gender, just as long as you are imaginative and can create and play any kind of character.\n\nI'd prefer an open-ended story with liberty for us to set the direction as we go. To start things off, here are some ideas I have in mind for the beginning scene of the roleplay (though, these are just ideas and I wouldn't want to limit the RP/story to just this!): \n\n* It's a rainy Christmas evening nearing midnight. Two characters happen to find themselves in a cafe to wait out the rain. Perhaps one is a customer and the other is the attending barista, or perhaps both are customers, it's up to us! The two start up a conversation while waiting out the rain.\n* All flights are delayed at an international airport due to a sudden thunderstorm. Two people start up a conversation in the boarding area while waiting for their planes. Are they taking the same plane or have separate flights? Up to us!\n* A new boarder(s) arrives in a hostel in a South East Asian country. The current guests welcome them and they form a friendship over traveling, and maybe they end up traveling together (maybe we could play multiple characters in this scenario)\n\nThat's all from me folks. If you happen to have any interest, PM me a little introduction and what caught your eye the most about this! Have a nice day all :) \n\n\\- T",

I am male and 19 years old and I would prefer you to be in the same age range.\n\nI have done many roleplays in the last few years and I am in mood for another one. I really enjoy fantasy or scifi themes, which happen in another world and I like a nice story with romance as the main genre. I prefer if some action or survival in the story, so we have to fight or maybe solve a mistery. I have a plot idea in mind but I am open to new ones, so if you are interested tell me what you have in mind. Usually I write around 10 lines per reply and I use kik or discord for roleplaying. I'm fine with smut, as long as it isn't the main thing in the roleplay. I put some effort in my roleplays and I reply a few times throughout the day, I hope you do too!\n\nIf you are interested, PM me with your kik or discord :) please don't use reddit chat, because I can't see that on mobile.",

            "selftext": "**Ozman Paranormal Group**\n\nThe Ozman Paranormal Group was founded in October of 1974 by Walter Theodore Ozman after he conducted his own paranormal investigation surrounding the untimely death of his wife, Barbara.  Having successfully placed her spirit to rest, Walter decided to dedicate his life and abundance of wealth to helping those in need of paranormal cleansing.  Walter has learned and experienced much over the last thirty-five years, but as old age sets in, he has decided to hang up his hat and pass the baton down to his assistant, Elliot Hammel.  It is now up to Elliot to put together his own team of investigators to fill their little office space in Denver, Colorado, and continue his predecessor\u2019s work.  Will you be the one to apply for a job?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**About the Roleplay**\n\nOzman Paranormal Group was created with the intention to be a small, tight knit group of about six (6) members total.  It will host a healthy mix of paranormal, adventure, slice of life, drama, and long-term story progression with plenty of room for character growth and relationship development.  The roleplay encourages writers to help drive the story forward, come up with their own \u201cepisodes\u201d (or plots/scenes/chapters) and be active in discord.  The goal is to make the roleplay function like a chapter book, or television series.  There will be days where the characters are gone for weeks at a time ghost hunting (locally or overseas) and solving mysteries.  Other days, they\u2019ll be celebrating the holidays with one another, or going about their daily lives before the dangers of big adventures.  There will be conflict, scares, laughs, romance and heartbreak.  All it needs is you to help guide it with your fellow writers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Writing Venue =** Google Docs (but Discord can be discussed as an option.)\n\n**Chatting Venue =** Discord\n\n*Both will be used collaboratively.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Requirements**\n\n* Writers must be literate (i.e. able to use proper grammar, punctuation, capitalization and spellcheck.)\n* Writers must be experienced in the third person, past tense, writing format.\n* Writers must be capable of writing para-novella.  No, not every post needs to be 3,000 words, but you must be able to do so if/when the time calls for it, such as for starters and scene set ups.  Typically, posts should be \u201cas long as they need to be.\u201d\n* Writers must able to recap their fellow writer\u2019s previous posts, provide internal monologue, include dialogue, and know the basic rules of roleplay (no god-modding, no controlling other writer characters, etc.)\n* Writers must be comfortable with using Google Docs as the main writing venue, with Discord being used as the main social hub for plot/brainstorming, as well as other fun chatter.\n* Due to the mature nature of the roleplay, writers must be 21+ in order to apply.\n* Writers must be comfortable with NSFW themes, such as drugs, sex, violence, and language.\n* Writers must be willing to participate long-term.  Please do not apply if you plan on ghosting (pun intended.)  Make sure you read everything here to make sure this is the right group for you.\n* Writers must help make the roleplay fun, but also semi-realistic.  Characters should not be doing things just for the sake of doing them.  Reasons and motives should be thought about beforehand.  If you're not sure what those could be, ask your group members for brainstorming help before writing it prematurely.\n* Writers must be comfortable with playing \\\\\\*\\\\\\*one main character\\\\\\*\\\\\\*, with the option of writing their own supporting characters (or NPCs that only you control.)  Supporting characters/NPC\u2019s are characters (or animals) that occasionally surround your character, such as family members, friends, enemies, pets, and/or entities.\n* As we are all adults here, I fully anticipate that we\u2019ll all have jobs and lives outside of roleplay that need tending to.  However, writers \\\\\\*\\\\\\*must\\\\\\*\\\\\\* be able to post once every other day on \\\\\\*average\\\\\\*.  Obviously there may be two or three days where posting is impossible due to life.  If that ever becomes the case, please let your fellow group members know.  Don\u2019t just disappear.\n* This is not, and will not ever be, a rapid-fire posting group.  While speedy posts and lines of pure dialogue are welcome on occasion, rapid fire replies will never be expected of you, nor should you expect it of your fellow writers.\n* In addition to helping with plots, writers must be friendly, cooperative, and open to other proposed ideas.  The better goal, however, would be for everyone to compromise and find a happy medium that everyone agrees on.\n* Writers must use live action face claims for their character(s), preferably ones with a decent amount of pictures and GIFs that suit the RPG theme/genre.  Main characters must also be between the ages of 21 - 35.  Supporting characters can be any age.\n* Further details will be provided once you message me expressing interest.  (Do not use the messenger app.  Please send a PM.)  This process is to help guarantee that you will be writing with writers of equal quality.\n* If you are selected for the group, you will promptly be invited to join the Discord server.  However, please be patient while I continue to seek out additional writers.  I am willing to wait weeks\u2014\\*months\\*, even\u2014if it means finding worthwhile writers.\n* Finally, Ozman Paranormal Group will be starting from the ground up, which means you and your fellow writers will have a say in some of the world building and paranormal \u201cguidelines\u201d, so to speak, such as what\u2019s real and not real when it comes to ghosts, demons and creatures, as well as how to vanquish them, fight them, or lay them to rest.\n\nIf you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask.  I look forward to hearing from you!",

I\u2019m Rebecca, 25, and what I have for you today is something quite unique: I have created a fantasy world and I am looking to GM for anyone ready for an adventure in it! For those who don\u2019t know what a GM is, to put it simply, you will be RP\u2019ing as the main character and I will RP as the \u2018world\u2019 around you. This means that the world at a starting point is set in stone, but as you traverse, interact and create a story, it of course changes, depending on your actions.\nThen, onto the world itself. I want to keep my cards close to my chest a bit as I think it\u2019s more fun if you go in blind and explore and discover what can be found there organically through the story, but I want to share a few important details. The world is essentially a big continent called Arkanea and is inhabited 100% by women. Depending on where the various communities, kingdoms and cities lie however, these women differ greatly, although almost all of them could probably still best be described as human. So no orcs, goblins, etc., although non-humanoid (fantasy) creatures still exist. The technology-level of the world is Medieval, so swords, bow and arrow and horseback riding, but things like architecture and other cultural elements of certain places may also be inspired by other eras of humanity\u2019s past. Don\u2019t expect anyone in skinny jeans though.\nNow as to what I want and expect from your character, there actually isn\u2019t much set-in-stone. All I ask of your character is to be female, because of the world (you yourself don\u2019t have to be), and with an interest in exploring and traversing the world, a world you do not know much about yet. Why that is however is up to you. If you want to look for love, be my guest. Want to be the greatest knight in the land? Go ahead. You can be a mercenary in it for the money or a helpful medic or explorer doing good deeds, it\u2019s up to you!\n\nNow, finally, some last other pointers as to what I\u2019m looking for:\n\n- I don\u2019t care about how long your messages are. Quality &gt; quantity in my book. If you can put everything you need to say in one sentence, be my guest.\n\n- When playing with a GM, I think it\u2019s very important that the both of us have the same image of what things or people look like when playing. This is why I heavily encourage the use of reference pictures when RP\u2019ing. I use them for any relevant character when GM\u2019ing myself and real pictures that is, so make sure you\u2019re comfortable with that.\n\n- I\u2019m pretty much limitless, so anything is fair game in these RPs\n\n- I exclusively RP on Kik, so make sure you mention your username when you PM me\n\nHope to hear from you soon!",

            "selftext": "Hey! I'm an experienced role player whose looking to play with the theme of arranged marriage. I like the idea of two people going into an arranged marriage looking for the best, but also having to balance the fact they do not know each other at all, and the fact that they have to do this for duty.\n\nI'm interested in exploring it in several different ways, perhaps something historical, dealing with royalty and cultural issues as well as the pressure to have perfection in court as they're getting to know each other and dealing with all of that. The worries and intrigue of two recently at war countries brokering peace through marriage and those two young people having to deal with their own issues regarding the other country while trying to provide an example of peace.\n\nI also like the idea of looking at it from a more modern viewpoint, of two children of the elite who in order to keep their trust funds have to marry to cement a business deal, a way of merging companies that doesn't have as much oversight. Two modern people dealing with the fact that they thought the power they had through family wealth was absolute finding out how tied they are to their family as well and having to grow up and become a part of that, or figure out what else they want to do.\n\nI'm also interested in seeing it in the Harry Potter Universe, I would love to play against Draco Malfoy in an arranged marriage with an OC of mine from a pureblood wizarding family that's more muggle friendly and they've been arranged to help the business but also to help rehabilitate the Malfoy's image and the two have to deal with all of that, and being able to kind of explore the pureblood world after the war and as everything is settling down.\n\nI've been roleplaying for a long time (Over 10 years) and love playing original characters, I'm also down to do doubling, if you have a character you'd love to play in a situation like this. I do really like having a female OC that I play but am open to playing another character against a character for my partner! I only really play on discord, and work weird hours but do try and respond when I can!! I also understand that most of us have lives outside of Roleplay! Please PM me if you're interested in talking out some plot ideas!",

I'm open to O.C content for either, or we can do cannon characters.  It does not matter to me whether you role play in 1st or 3rd person I do a hybrid of both typically and I am not picky. I do prefer long detailed responses however, please over 2 sentences is not hard.  I want these to include smut and romance, but that cannot be the main focus. Please put your favorite color in your response so know you have read this far at least. They can and will include violence in them, but the amount and severity are very negotiable. I prefer Kik or Discord for RP, and when you message me I will give you my usernames. Also be over 18 as these will feature adult themes. If you're reading this I am still looking. \n\n\nRDR2- The west is, and always will he wild. Join me on an adventure of wild west shinanaghans, romance and an immersive world build.\n\nGOT- This will be how season 8 should have been. We will scrap what we dont like and start over!",

            "selftext": "Hlan, the great trading city that sat on the coast of the Twilight Sea, was nearly in sight and it was as more frightening then anyone could have imagined...\n\nThe journey to Hlan had been an interesting one, and one that not many people experienced in their life. Hlan was the furthest west that most maps recorded, and some people say it sat at the edge of the world. Aliya had set out from the Jiziran Free States, which were a collection of culturally and linguistically similar nations on the southern most part of the continent of Almania. From there she sailed west aboard a merchant ship, and passed by many of the more exotic and interesting places of the world. But where most people would have stopped Aliya kept sailing west, and things only became more and more strange. \n\nAs their vessel approached the Twilight Sea the waters became a swirling mass of black and purple threatening to hypnotize even the most strong willed of individuals. The captain advised Aliya not too stare too long into the waters lest she wanted the Sleepers to turn her mad and hurl herself into the suffocating waters below. Needless to say Aliya kept her distance from the edge of the boat from that point on. Despite the terrifying nature of the Twilight Sea the waters were as calm as a rocking chair, and the soothing sound of the gentle waves threatened to put her to sleep. The captain said that the Sleepers did this on purpose so they could subjugate entire crews into unconsciousness, and then climb aboard their ships to steal their people away to underwater prisons. All along the joinery Aliya dared not ask who, or what these Sleepers were, but they surely couldn\u2019t have been real.\n\nHlan rose like a series of great black monoliths out of the thick green jungles that surrounded the city. It sprawled so massively along the entire coastline that one wasn\u2019t even able to see where the city began, and where it ended. But the jungle had overtaken much of the city, and now only a few enclaves here and there served as settlements and trading ports for the few brave souls who dared to live here. Hlan\u2019s architecture was jagged, foreign, and alien to anything Aliya had ever seen before. Non-Euclidean geometry served as the basis for most of the city, with only a few buildings resembling structures that she recognized, but those buildings seemed new in comparison to the ancient constructs surrounding them. Aliya stood on the edge of her boat, nearly trembling from the sight of it all, but she kept as much composure as she could. The port was the most lively part of the city, and there actually were a fair amount of boats coming to and fro the great black granite docks of Hlan. Some were simple merchant ships, and others looked like fully functioning war galleons, but even with all these ships much of the port remained empty waiting for boats that would never come. Aliya fixed her cloak, and finally was able to break her gaze from the alien city that stood before her.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nHey everyone. My names Danny and I\u2019ve been on the lookout for a new partner or two for a while now. I know lots of people are busy nowadays, but hopefully we can find sometime to develop a really fun and interesting story that satisfies any cravings we might have!\n\nA little about me. I\u2019m a 22 year old girl from the East Coast United States and I\u2019m about to start my last year of college. I\u2019ve been roleplaying for quite a while now, and I think I\u2019ve gotten pretty good over the years. Most of my experience came from internet chat rooms and playing dungeons and dragons!\n\nI roleplay in the third person, typically write in a paragraph format, and enjoy lots of descriptors of settings, emotions and everything. I like it when I can really sort of picture the scene in my head and maybe also feel what the characters are feeling.\n\nI enjoy mostly any kind of roleplay. I mostly do medieval fantasy, and although I still think it\u2019s my favorite genre by far, it can get a bit stale after some time. So I\u2019m really looking to do any other sort of roleplay that you may have in mind as long as it meets all the requirements I laid out. But after saying that I have been craving a more darker/gothic medieval fantasy roleplay. I like NSFW themes, actions and settings as long as it\u2019s not the absolute focus of the whole roleplay.\n\nThat\u2019s about everything, hopefully I hear from you and we can work something out. I\u2019m usually on Discord, but if that\u2019s a problem I\u2019m totally willing to move to a different place! Thanks!",

I like thinking up a fun story we can both get into, and building a good character (and NPCs, etcetera.) to go with it. \n\nPlease be 18+, as I\u2019m an adult, and adult themes may take place. (They don\u2019t have to, but it\u2019s not off limits.) \n\nI only write in third person. I write multiple paragraphs. Usually averaging 2-4 but honestly it varies on what\u2019s going on, I can do more. I think good spelling and grammar is awesome. Although, let\u2019s face it, mistakes definitely happen! I just want to understand things well, and have fun. I\u2019m pretty descriptive and love getting immersed in the story. \n\nI\u2019m not new to RP, kinda new to Reddit, sorta new to Discord. But I\u2019ve been RPing for about seven years or so. In my experience it would be best to have a partner who is patient. I can do a back and forth mostly during weekdays, during the day. I\u2019m usually not up all night. (EST.) But sometimes it varies. I\u2019ll reply when I can. \n\nMy strongest suite is high fantasy/medieval genre. I\u2019m open to low fantasy/medieval, and post apocalyptic as well in a slice of life setting. Weaker points would be Sci-Fi and things like that. World building is okay, to a degree, as long as it isn\u2019t overly complicated. Lol And I don\u2019t really do fandoms, but I could try? I\u2019m not into a lot of that stuff, so it\u2019s kinda hard for me when I\u2019m so unfamiliar, I guess. \n\nFeel free to message me. We\u2019ll see how it goes and move on from there. Thank you.",

Some may have been born with them while others gained the potential in their older years, yet there are those that say that were shot or stabbed with a unique arrow by robed men in order to gain their stands, but regardless of their origin, all of these Stand users would being to meet and collide with one another through fate. The influence of this user has had great pull on many stand users as many are recruited to work for them, or killed if defying them. Years later in 1986, the mysterious Stand user \"Over Heaven\" announces a large inconceivable bounty of immortality, riches, and vast power under their rule should they retrieve the rumored 'Stand Arrow' used to create Stand users. While many have searched for it in their name, others have had other intentions of keeping the arrow for themselves, creating armies of Stand users at their will or even to bribe the mysterious Over Heaven. Regardless of this, those in the underground or Stand user world have begun to search for the legendary arrow, clashing with one another in attempts to finally cease it, for this is a journey that will take place... Around The World.

You can make up to 5 various characters, and explore wherever and whenever you like around the world! I am owner and main host, and I have only 1 active Staff member.

Sure, it was a cartoon series in the '80s. However, the 2002 series set up the potential for a serious world that on the level of Lord of the Rings. Furthermore, the movie was a bit cheesy. \n\nI love bad guys (lol). I am interested in role-playing/writing a story focusing on Skeletor &amp; Evil-Lyn. Yet, it's a bit of re-imagination with Evil-Lyn and a bit of storytelling that departs from \"canon\" or anything from the He-Man and the MOTU mythos. However, I'd love to have a story that has them as this power couple, well after Keldor becomes Skeletor. In other words, a romance tale. Set when they're established behind Snake Mountain. \n\nMy Evil-Lyn is a bit re-imagined and I think she would be a nice departure from how she has been depicted in other mediums. I think we can brainstorm a costume design for her too. Yet, I wanted to show you what I'm imagining here.\n\nI\u2019m trying to see if I can head somewhere to a place someone would be willing to help me with this.",

Looking for OC x OC  specifically, but I have a soft spot for Shepard x Ashley, Shepard x Liara, Shepard x Tali, Shepard x Miranda and Ryder x Vetra, then also Ryder x Peebee, but if you're not a fan of Andromeda, then we don't have to delve into that particular continuation.\n\nPlease be literate and grammatically correct as always, though I can forgive the odd typo, since we're all subject to them! Not too fussed with post length, I can match my partner, though please be st least a paragraph, and no one liners, please!\n\nHope to hear from you soon!\n\nP,S.

I have a huge passion for writing and literature overall and writing has been my biggest creative outlet. I consider myself to be literate and I can handle most writing styles and lengths (I tend to do 3-6 paragraphs depending on the post) Though, I don\u2019t have too much expectations for what skills my partners have I expect at least a little experience and for you to be confident with writing yourself. \n\nApart from writing, I have a large love for romance. Weather it be Cheesy, classic and even more dark or graphic (though i like a mix of them all the most.) I love many different pairings and relationships and I would love to explore some. I will list some pairings I enjoy below, but if you already have a pairing you want to explore or if you already have an idea set up I would like to see that too!\n\nPairings I enjoy; \n- Doctor / Nurse or Patient\n- Teacher / Student\n- Soldier / Nurse \n- Android / Human (I would be open to doing something within the Detroit Become Human story or something similar.)   \n\nI am open to doing fandoms if I have knowledge of it and it\u2019s something we both enjoy. So don\u2019t be scared to ask! \n\nHope to hear from some of you soon!",

            "selftext": "M/F\n\nLooking for a female partner for a marvel rp. I have an oc, however I don\u2019t mind who you play. My character himself is quite dark but that doesn\u2019t mean the rp has to be. I would like to keep details of my OC a secret until the rp itself as it would have more impact in writing, however if you do want to know then will tell you without complaint. \n\nThis oc does not lend himself well to nsfw content due to his physical Make up, however if romance does blossom between characters then I\u2019m all for it. In terms of response length I'm relaxed as long as I have something to continue the story with. However I would prefer if you could write at least a paragraph as I prefer to write at least one paragraph per response and usually will be longer than that. OOC discussion generally as well as about the rp is something I care about, I love a good twist in the story but if there is a detail you wish to discuss then I'm happy to talk. \n\nPlease feel free to dm me about this and we can talk further about this rp. Thanks!",

            "selftext": "\nSome of you may recognize this as the plotline to Fallout: DUST. I had been getting back into the Fallout series, but I would really like to take a much darker, and I mean /darker/ spin to the story. DUST is an alternate timeline to Fallout New Vegas with a lot of dark content, a bleak atmosphere and many touchy topics that I think could make a great story. We can discuss it more in private but I am open to doing a story based on the Prelude to The Fall, the soldier of the civil war leading up to the outbreak or even the Aftermath where there are those trying to find a way to salvation! If you think you'd be interested in spinning a story of survival and waning hope then feel free to send me a message with whichever platform you prefer.  \n\n\n*Battle of Hoover Doom II*  \nTwenties years prior to the present day DUST, The Courier alongside the NCR take their final stand at the Hoover Dam. Essentially driving them back across the Colorado River and maintaining the Hoover Dam for the NCR. However, shortly after the end of the war, Courier Six attempted to seize control of the Mojave through use of the Securitrons under the NCRs noses. The battle between Courier Six and the NCR was brief before the NCR finally got the upperhand and forced the Courier into hiding, branding him a domestic terrorist and occupying the Vegas Strip by force. Removing the families from power and putting New Vegas under NCR jurisdiction. This move was seen very unfavorably by many in the Vegas area, The Kings pushing for insurrection within Freeside and the Strip leading to a civil war where many began to turn on the NCR as an oppressive occupier.  \n\n\n*The Vegas Civil War*\n\nThe Courier had become a figurehead of revolution to many people in and out of the Vegas area. The Kings starting a violent insurrection which forced the NCR to bring the Mojave under Martial Law. Curfews came into effect, heavy patrols were put out on the streets due to high threats of snipers and ambushes now under The King's influence. The NCR turned the Lucky 38 Casino into the base of operations for the new task force assigned with suppressing the insurrection, although under the eyes of any including their own chain of command operatives within the NCR discovered the location of the Sierra Madre. Turning Mr. House's old tomb into a brand new laboratory, the NCR brought their best scientists to begin retrieving samples of \"The Cloud\" and the bio-material of the Ghost People to see if they could reverse engineer it into bio-weapons and other experimental technology to bring back to California and turn the tide of the war. The war was seeing little progress on either end for the past five years, though Vegas Residents were disappearing regularly now and being last spotted being taken prisoner within the Lucky 38 for unknown reasons. A radio broadcast from California soon reached the task force, warning of a sandstorm approaching The Mojave and an evacuation being recommended for all NCR citizens.  It wasn't until their was an sudden breach within the Lucky 38, the Cloud samples had been released and formed a second storm within The Strip that was quickly overtaking the area. Due to the experimentation from the NCR Scientists the Second Cloud was far more horrid than the original and had begun turning much of The Vegas Strip and Freeside inhospitable.  \n\n\n*The Fall*\n\nTerror and chaos as the Cloud Began engulfing The Strip. The NCR began executing citizens without discrimination due to how many were exposed and turning into twisted creatures of The Cloud. Those who could were escorted through the Monorail for evacuation. The Kings rebellion had their last gun fight against the NCR, before being driven down to the sewers of Freeside to save those they could from the coming Cloud. Radio broadcasts urging anyone still alive to flee underground where they'd be promised shelter and supplies, the rest were doomed to death after the NCR locked down all gates within The Strip and Freeside. Had they not made it into the old casinos they were forced to succumb to the Cloud.  \n\n\n*The Dust Storm*\n\nMost NCR and Rebel Operatives didn't even get the broadcast when the Cloud broke out and evacuation came into effect, the Dust Storm saturated with radiation swept across The Mojave and devastated the lands. Those who didn't flee to immediate shelter or had proper equipment were killed or turned into Ghouls quickly, some operatives of the NCR on the outside managed to lead a convoy into Zion Valley. Though they went dark soon after with their fate being unknown, the last message sent out being reports of Spores sprouting along the valley.  \n\n\n*The End*  \nJust as Ulysses predicted, the Divide cracked and the Tunnelers moved to the West. The Cloud and Storm blot out the sun forever, allowing them to travel on surface and devour much of the human and animal population. With most food being scarce and those settlements still being hospital under the control by unknown forces or remnants of the NCR unable to evacuate, many turned to murder and cannibalism were they unable to store enough food. The NCR still within New Vegas have issued a shoot on sight for any survivors still found in the area, and signs of evac have not been seen. All that remains are clues as to some people who may still be operating within New Vegas, maps to potential escape routes and the Broadcast from the King's Rebellion.",

I like my stories to have romance between the characters, even if they probably start off as enemies in some way or another. Characters with antagonistic origins that evolve into something more is a delight to unravel. \n\nIf you have any ideas or any stories you want to play out, please feel free to message me!

My name's James, and I'm looking for someone literate who's willing to respond with a least one paragraph per response.\n\nI live in the U.K., so I may have a differing time zone to most of you. Time zones aren't an issue for me personally, as I'm quite used to them, but I know they can be an issue for others. I also have college on Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays (weird, I know), so I'll usually be replying late those days, if it makes a difference.\n\nI personally like realism in my roleplays, as I'm fascinated by biology and how the human body reacts under certain circumstances. This doesn't necessarily mean we can only do realistic roleplays such as slice of life, as I imagine fantasy or sci-fi would certainly be made very interesting by incorporating realism. Action could also be made much more fun by this, especially researching how the body reacts to different injuries, as well as just how resilient the human body can be. \n\nThe realism aspect would also mean potentially needing to add a weight and height description to your character profile, as this may drastically change what your character would be realistically capable of. Personally, I find said limitations can make the roleplay more fun! Finding creative ways to get around the limitations, potentially adding more dramatic scenes with the addition of infected wounds, etc. \n\nIf anyone has any ideas they'd like to discuss, feel free to PM me! I don't bite! I hope I can have some fun experiences with you guys!",

It didn\u2019t take long for it to quickly spread to the whole county, then the state, finally the country. It\u2019s mostly been contained to north america but without news from the outside I\u2019ve had no way to know. It\u2019s only been 7 months but by now the whole country is infested with either the undead or the multiple gangs that have sprung up. I\u2019ve been running low on food and water so I think this brief history of this year will be one of my last transmissions. For now though, I\u2019ve been Cassidy Crystal, signing off.\u201d With this radio station 1.14 goes cold for the day.\n\nHey everyone, not sure how good that starter is but my rp idea is a group zombie apocalypse rp. There\u2019s a few rules but it\u2019s pretty laid back and just starting out so as long as we get some active members this can be great. Also I'm trying to keep this fairly small for now. Oh and i guess i should mention, nsfw content is allowed but it won\u2019t be the main focus. Looking forward to hearing from you all.",

            "selftext": "**A small warning to start out** \\- My roleplay takes place a few years after the series finale of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic. My roleplay starter contains a lot of spoilers of what happened. So if you haven't finished the series yet and wish to avoid spoilers, I suggest finishing the series finale before coming up to ask me. Thank you, have a nice day.\n\n**Also** \\- I am including the spoiler tag because the rp itself contains spoilers. Again, just for those not wanting to be spoiled.\n\n==================\n\nHello everyone! I'm new here, just joined an hour or so earlier and I'm already looking for a roleplay partner. And I bring forth a long, somewhat complex roleplay. Let me explain what I'm looking for, and give some requirements to those who are interested:\n\n1. You will have to roleplay as multiple characters during certain points, but not for the whole rp.\n2. This rp is very story-driven. Don't worry, I don't require long essays for each reply. 1-2 sentences minimum, but the sentences can't be short. \n3. There will be small portions where I take control for a bit. This is due to the fact that small portions will mainly focus on the characters I roleplay as. They won't be long, just some short dialogue exchanges.\n4. There will be fighting in this. Please don't be OP with the characters you play as.\n5. I will be assigning you characters. And they will be canon characters. I hope you don't mind.\n\n==================\n\nBefore going further, I must tell everyone that I am a male roleplayer, but I will be roleplaying as a female character. I hope that doesn't weird anyone out.\n\nI will be giving tags to my rp, then after I will give a short summary of where the story takes us without spoiling anything from the finale.\n\n\\[Tags\\]\n\n* Mlp (obviously)\n* Darkness\n* Corruption\n* Adventure\n* Action\n\n\\[Short Summary\\]\n\nThe story follows a young, natural-born alicorn mare who's life is as simple as it gets. She never learned to use magic or learned how to fly, nor has she found her cutie mark. But that hasn't kept her from living a nice life. Having moved to Canterlot from Manehatten, she found a job working as a furniture salesmare. Soon her wings and horn attract the attention of those in power, who bring her in to teach her how to use magic and to fly. She becomes quickly stressed as she is thrusted into unfamiliar territory, her simple life becoming more like chaos than anything else. When she finally hits her breaking point, her negative emotions attract a creature of darkness who sees her as an opportunity... And she allows it.\n\n==================\n\nI hope that was good enough! If anyone is interested, please pm me for my Discord username and number so we can get to roleplaying.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you and have a nice day.",

I roleplay on discord only, Reddit messages are just inconvenient. I'm fine roleplaying with males and females I only do 1x1 roleplays though. I'm a semi-literate to literate roleplayer, I like the details that can make it easier to imagine the setting and scene. I play mostly as female roles since that's what I'm good at, I also write in the third person. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor genres, I like romance, action, drama, fantasy, adventure, mythology, sci-fi, slice of life. I would love to try horror, mystery, thriller. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm okay with fandom roleplays but I normally like the idea to be just set in the world of the fandom. Mostly because I don't wanna act out of character. But keep in mind I might not know/like a certain fandom. I won't be rude about it as long as you understand that and don't blow up on me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut fandoms I'm apart of is Diabolik Lovers, Subnautica, Starbound, Rimworld, Fallout (the game series), Skyrim, My Time At Portia, Amnesia (the anime), most studio ghibli movies, Fable (the game series),  Stardew Valley. Just to name a few so you get an idea about stuff that I'm interested in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyhow, I would love to hear from you! Message me if you believe we would make suitable partners.

If you are looking for pure smut than please understand I'm not doing that. I'm not against it if it comes naturally in a story but I won't do a roleplay based around smut.

I also enjoy people who are descriptive in what they say. Obviously not word extending essay style description. But, i will also take advice, as long as it's not just straight up saying im bad at writing. I know I'm not the best writer but i try. I try to write as much as i can per reply. I also usually am free so i can rp most the time. Pm me if you want to. Thanks for reading.\n\nPeace.",

            "selftext": "I literally couldn't think of a better title than that, I swear.\n\n\nThat aside, Hello! I'm back, today looking for less of a prompt, and more of a...general search? I have no idea. Before I get into the nitty gritty, allow me to say a bit about myself. I'm a 20-something male with plenty of writing experience, about 6ish years or so. I'm the kind of guy who (proudly) sprouts absurd and out there ideas, literally just on a whim or the slightest bit of inspiration. Seriously. Sometimes I can get a little crazy. My post length is anywhere between 1-3 paragraphs, but I came definitely get more out if I'm feeling inspired.  I'm also, for whom it might concern, in the central timezone of the United States. That being said, I have a horrid sleep schedule, so I'll usually be up pretty late into the night.\n\n\nWith that out of the way, let me say what I'm looking for. I am (unsurprisingly) looking for a female partner to nerd out with, 18+ of course, just in case we *do* go down a NSFW road at some point (It's welcome, but I'd like to not to be the focus of anything). **I will not, under any circumstances, write with someone under the age of 18**. I'm not comfortable with it, and I'm sorry if someone out there disagrees with this. Additionally, I'm looking for someone that I can call my friend. All proper and business is boring. I like to freak out with my writing partners. Come up with dumb plotlines or AUs. If you're looking for something strictly professional, I'm probably not your guy.\n\n\n\nFinally, we get down to what I'm *really* gonna be vague on. As you might've guessed by the title, I'm looking for something fantasy related. What specifically, you might ask? I have no clue. I'm a sucker for romance plots, with an epic adventure hanging above our characters' head. Be it slaying gods, or sealing away an ancient evil, I can't get enough of it. I love all sorts of different fantasy races, too. Elves? Oh yeah. Demons? Sure! Any kind of Yokai? *my god, that'll press my buttons in juuust the right way*. That being said, anyone that brings an idea with **Kitsune** as a major emphasis will make me *very* happy. Anyway. If you have any existing ideas, please, throw them at me! I love reading through plots n ideas. Want to create something new? We can chat for a bit, and see what we both like.\n\n\nI'm rambling now, aren't I? I think I've gone on for long enough. If I've caught your eye, please, shoot me a message, and I'll get to you ASAP. I get a lot of messages, so I'm sorry if I don't get to you right away. Some messages also slip through the cracks, or don't follow a certain obvious rule, so sorry on that regard as well. Just be sure to include your favorite color in your title, so I know you got down this far. I won't respond without it, because I don't enjoy it when people don't read my post. Like I said, I'm usually around into the late hours of the night, so you'll likely catch me. Thanks for reading!\n\n\n(Oh, by the way, don't send me a message only saying \"hey I think we can work something out\" or the like. Tell me about yourself, have some energy. Those kind of intros give me life)",

I am a graduate student and I work, so I don\u2019t have a lot of free time for a lot of partners.\u00a0\n\nRules (kind of?):\n\n18+: Please please please, be over the age of 18. I work in education. While we may not end up writing anything NSFW, should it lean that way I want to know that I won\u2019t lose my job. I will check your history and if anything seems fishy, I won\u2019t rp with you. Please don\u2019t lie to me.\u00a0\n\nI don\u2019t like having to write hugely long replies. I do more than one liners, but usually only a small paragraph unless the scene calls for more. If you want to go all out and write a huge reply, go for it. I won\u2019t try and match your length though. And you don\u2019t have to match mine if I end up writing something long. As long as it\u2019s more than a one liner, we\u2019re good.\u00a0\n\nI can\u2019t reply a lot and I don\u2019t reply quickly. Sometimes I am available to focus solely on the roleplay for a while, but not usually. Typically I give a reply a day.\u00a0\n\nI am EST in the US. I\u2019m usually awake from 9am-12am, but some days I have to get up at 6am. My replies will probably usually come before noon.\u00a0\n\nYou can write whatever gender you want from men, women, to non-binary, to an alien with some mysterious and other gender, do what you want. I will probably write a woman unless the storyline we come up with perfectly lines up with a male character I already have.\u00a0\n\nPlease have at least moderate writing skills. If you end up writing like a man who has never even seen a woman or a 14 year old who just discovered fan fiction, I\u2019m not going to want to roleplay with you.\u00a0\n\n\nAs far as plot goes, I really want to write something where I\u2019m writing a human and you are writing something Not Human. If you want that to be a vampire, a witch, an alien, a demon, an elf whatever. I really a romance, but it doesn\u2019t have to be a healthy relationship. If you are interested, please message me with your age, what idea sparked your interest, and a little writing sample. If I don\u2019t get all three of those things, I won\u2019t reply, so please make sure you send all that.\u00a0",

I've been rping for years and am a bit of a writer besides so I'm looking for people who can put up a few paragraphs usually 3-4 is a pretty good standard and I'm only really looking for people who will rp on Discord. It's just so much more convenient than anything else I've used.\n\nShe-Ra: This one is a little strange so bear with me. I have not actually watched much of the show, I fell in love with Catra and Adora from the first few episodes, fan-art, and fanfics. So I'd love to rp that pairing preferably not a major AU like college roomates or something, I like the friends to enemies to lovers dynamic they have and the morally complicated relationship they have involving the Horde and the Rebellion. Plus Etheria has a lot of interesting things to work with like First One ruins and magic. So I'd like to RP in setting but other than that I'm open to working out a plot between us.\n\nRWBY: I'm open to more pairings for this one though Weiss, Penny, and Yang are probably my favorite characters to include and I will not do anything involving any of the men. I've fallen out with the show in later seasons but I still love the characters and the setting. Something involving the Grimm would be my preference for major plot points, not Salem and the later villains. I'm open for most things though so feel free to message me.\n\nPlease send me a message if you're interested and not reddit direct messages. I'm not on Reddit on my PC most of the time and the direct messenger doesn't notify me on my phone.",

Let me tell a little about myself first before I say what I'm looking for exactly. \n\nI'm 24. I've been roleplaying for 10 years on and off. I'm also a novel writer (unpublished) I have problems keeping me from writing novels so I roleplay. Plus I love it. I normally roleplay in the fantasy or supernatural genre (i.e vampires, werewolves, witches, elves, dragons, stuff like that) I love reading fandom roleplays but I've never really been able to get into them. I also normally do a mix of drama, action and romance. Though Id be up for different types. It all depends. I dont do smut based roleplays. It gets boring..and predictable. \n\nAs for my writing style and rules. I use third person. I require you to be 18+ (as stated above), literate, and openminded as I am. \n\nIf your interested. I'd love to chat with you. I will most likely only take a few partners and I will also probably use discord. Thank you!!",

            "selftext": "Hey, I am heihoi, a woman on my later twenties who has been roleplaying ever since I was like fifteen years old. I am literate and I put a great amount of work and detail into developing the characters, plot and the world, so I want a partner who is into world-building too. I also enjoy writing multiple characters of different age, sex and sexuality so if you only want to write one-on-one romance I might not be the right partner for you. Roleplaying (in my opinion at least) is about giving and taking, so in order for both of us to enjoy what we\u2019re doing I hope to find someone who is also able to and willing to write both men and women in gay and straight relationships. I do not require you to write out explicit scenes, that can be discussed in private but I don\u2019t like it when I am stuck in one role and the partner is in the other. I do put the plot above the smutty stuff, so keep that in mind.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0Still reading? Great, maybe this could work out! I like darker themes in my rps and I have almost no limits as long as the angst and attention is shared evenly between my characters and yours. I don\u2019t want to always write the knight in the shining armor and I don\u2019t expect that from you either. I enjoy personalities that clash, difficult and dramatic relationships (be it romantic or not) and I am not afraid to make my characters flawed. Nothing is more annoying than a character who does no wrong and always has the answers. \n\n\nSo, what I'm looking for?\n\n I don't have anything specific in mind but I like horror, slice of life, pirates, vikings, modern fantasy and crime stuff. If you like any of the same stuff, pm me and let's talk! \n\n\nLast but not least. Since I\u2019m an old fart, I don\u2019t write with anyone under the age of 21. The older you are the better. I also feel a bit uncomfortable writing with men because I\u2019ve had some creepy encounters already in this short amount of time I\u2019ve been getting back into rping. I'm sorry, I don't want to be mean but that's just how it is.",

            "selftext": "Hey there. If you're currently looking for a place to do a Discord RP in, you can join Escapism. We're a slowly growing community that embraces the fun and creative hobby that is Roleplaying. We are just starting out and are in need of members - Roleplayers who are semi-literate or over - and Staff at the time of this post, so help us grow just by joining and getting involved! I'm dedicated to this server's success and open to suggestions made by my members.\n\nIn Escapism, we provide two things:\n\n\u2022 We provide a large playground with a detailed and well-thought out lore: Aurora Borealis. It is the product of an unexplained event called The Merge, which destroyed and merged many different universes onto one gigantic planet. This world consists of several references to games like Warframe and shows like Avatar: The Last Airbender &amp; Legend of Korra and also many other original ideas. Some made by other people. The world gives you almost NO LIMIT to character creation, allowing you to come up with whatever you can come up with or use characters that you've used before in other lores. \n\n\u2022 A Freeform RP with rules in place to prevent it from being cancerous. We call this The Realms of Freeform or RoF. With RoF, you can start pretty much straight away after you join. You don't need character sheets or whatever. You just need to come up with a story and find a partner. We also provide RP Prompts which help you start off a new RP. \n\n----\n\nIn Escapism we provide you with a lot of freedom when it comes to creativity. We don't give you a character sheet, you make your own. Whatever layout works. If it explains your character in the way you want to explain it, then it's perfect. \n\nPLEASE NOTE: We use Google Docs for a majority of our stuff. \n\nJoin using the link below!\n\ud835\udd41\ud835\udd60\ud835\udd5a\ud835\udd5f \u2115\ud835\udd60\ud835\udd68!\nhttps://discord.gg/tpenP4k",

One of our group members is an active role-player and she mentioned that it might handy to have a character generator for role-players and story-tellers. The purpose is to combine both real-life and make-believe statistics to generate characters with abilities and disabilities which creation hasn't been guided by the bias of the user. This approach would enable more versatile and interesting adventures.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo have more than one opinion, we would like to hear your voice as well! It should take less than 1 minute to answer these questions so hopefully you have time to help us to take the correct path. As you might guess, we're not aiming for a commercially feasible product but rather a handy little tool for the hobbyists and enthusiasts who might find it useful. In the end, there's a plan to publish this for everyone to use.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLink to Google Forms survey:\n\n[https://forms.gle/iQCdoFk6MvXog6FL8](https://forms.gle/iQCdoFk6MvXog6FL8)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for your time!",

If you\u2019re not able to enjoy playing them, I\u2019m afraid we aren\u2019t compatible. Sorry.\n\nHeathcliffe Heights is a small, dreary town in upstate New York that was known more for being rainy than it is for literally anything else. It consisted of a small downtown area with multiple shops and a few outdated  places for entertainment, 3 schools, a middle class suburb, a smaller, more upper class neighborhood further up the hill that the town was built around, and a more rural area that had old graveyards, churches, and a lake.\n\nThe DeWinters had just moved into one of the houses on Belial Lane, the row of upper middle to high class houses that looked down on the small town of Heathcliffe Heights. Dante DeWinter looked out of the window of his parent\u2019s black SUV as they pulled into the driveway of their new home. It was a large, Victorian era house mostly surrounded by trees save for the front. His family valued their privacy, so that was a big plus. \u201cIt seems we\u2019ve arrived. The furniture is already here so let\u2019s go ahead and bring our own things up.\u201d Dante\u2019s father, Caine said as he turned off the SUV and got out. Dante let out a small sigh, his breath fogging the glass of the window a little before he got out as well. The fresh fall wind tugged at his denim jacket as he stepped onto the gravel of the driveway. \u201cThis blows. We should\u2019ve stayed in Washington.\u201d Those words, accompanied by a huff came from the other side of the SUV from Circe, Dante\u2019s sister. Four years younger than him and going through the rebellious teen girl phase, she was a handful. \u201cLanguage, Circe. You\u2019ve yet to give the place a chance. Give it time before you jump to judgement.\u201d Smooth words from Minerva, Dante\u2019s mother. \n\nIt took him time to bring all of his things up to his room at the end of the hall on the second floor. It was a decent size with enough space to fit the various things he liked to collect. Though, he could already hear the faint sound of melodramatic music coming from his sister\u2019s room two doors down, Dante was fairly happy with his personal space. He walked over to the one window of the room, sitting down in the windowsill. The view of the town below was perfect, and he could even see Heathcliffe Heights High where he would be attending for his final year of grade school. \u201cUgh..\u201d he wasn\u2019t too happy about that. Especially since he didn\u2019t need to attend school. Why would he need to go to school to gain useless knowledge? Dante had basically eternity to learn things.. He and his family were vampires after all.\n\nHey! I\u2019ve been recently inspired to try a romantic RP with gothic, supernatural elements and I\u2019d like one of you to join me in creating a longterm story with many different themes! This RP is very opened ended as far as plot and direction go! If you have any ideas about anything, I\u2019d love to hear as I\u2019m not looking to carry the entire story on my own. If possible, I\u2019d love to do a Vampire x Human pairing, but you\u2019re not limited to that. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested, message me on Reddit.\n\nI\u2019m more likely to respond if you tell me what your favorite Thanksgiving food is! Hope to see you.",

She's quite a gossip and you are one of the few that let her tell you her slightly paranoid, yet uneventful comments about those that live near.\n\n\"Mr Peterson doesn't recycle, can you believe that?  I've seen him throw whole pieces of plastic right in his trash.\"\n\n\"Mrs Jones has invited that gardner of hers in her home many times when Mr Jones as out of the house.  Not to mention her children have been pulling apples from my tree and leaving cores in my front yard.\"\n\nIts many days like this.  Coffee and gossip fills your moments when you aren't busy with your own choice in careers.  \n\nBut she tells one story that catches your attention.\n\n\"I've been seeing the new man's basement light on very late at night.  I thought he left it on, but I saw him walking around it one night through one of his small windows.   He was on his phone and looking very upset.  He came up from it and went to his large black SUV.  His head kept turning like he was checking to see if anyone was watching him.  He pulled a very large box from it and....and he took it inside, but not until I saw a gun hidden in his waist band.\"\n\nWas she sure of what she saw? what's the deal with the new neighbor?  Do you snoop to find out or keep your distance like your nosey neighbor? Are you curious or concerned?\n\n\n\nIf this sounds like something you'd like to play with, fire off a message or chat.

That was until they came to us in the year, 1985. After that humans and Aliens worked with one another to help launch the future earlier than expected. \n\nThe year is now, 2100, and the galaxy is in the middle of a Cold War. The Commonwealth of Constellations (CC) are ready have been hinting for war if the The Ebon Federation (EB) is ready for it. The Ebon Federation has been sending threats and daring The CC to try and make the first move. Lives are at stake with galactic immigration is at a all time high and with space pirates on the loose it\u2019s unlikely that some of these colonies will ever reach their destination. Not only that but history is in danger of being rewritten, and lives will be uprooted. Both are corrupt federations who don\u2019t care about the people involved, they just want the money and the competition destroyed in the process. \n\nSome planets are going on lockdown meaning nobody but government officials can go in and out the planet, people are fighting for their rights to leave for a better future but instead are being locked up and killed. The galaxy is in the middle of a Cold War. And people are fearing for their lives.\n\nBut your not a part on either sides, instead you don\u2019t want a war. Your want peace, freedom, your want the galaxy to go back the way it way years before. The ShadowStar Republic is willing to step in a stop a galaxy war before it even happens, you want to expose the true colors of The CC and The EB to the world and put an end to their monstrous ways.\n\nWould you help to save the galaxy?\n\nIf you are interested shoot me a pm, I\u2019ll give you my discord.

            "selftext": "Hello!   I'm Doe and I'm looking for partners that are at least 21+ as that's  my  age range. I write multiple paragraphs/novella style (200-500+  words). I  love to write detailed descriptions and delve into a  character\u2019s  head/emotions as well as surroundings. I compare it to  writing a novel  together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI  understand if the scene  doesn\u2019t have alot going on and therefore  requires less. I adore having  long, thoughtful replies where we truly  immerse ourselves in the world.  I'm hoping to find a partner whose as  enthusiastic about the plot and  writing as I am. When I get invested in  a story, it\u2019s 100% dedication.  Getting a reply is the highlight of my  day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm   a big fan of romance and using face claims. I\u2019m the type to make   pinterest boards, spam you with gifs, headcanons, and send you songs   that remind me of our characters and/or ship.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast  but not least I only do MxF (with myself in the female role and you in  the male). I don\u2019t double, but I\u2019m more than happy to write side  characters of either gender to help move the story along.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd  highly prefer \\\\\\*\\\\\\*female authors writing male characters\\\\\\*\\\\\\* as I've had  too many bad encounters with male writers and at this point I'm  uncomfortable with it. Sorry guys!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDesperately Searching For:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\\\\\* 21+ partners\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\\\\\*  For you to have an excellent grasp of grammar, punctuation, spelling,  and capitalization. Both in character and \\\\\\*\\\\\\*out of character.\\\\\\*\\\\\\*  (Literate to advanced writers only, please. I'm not looking for newbies  or those who English isn't their first language).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\\\\\*  The  more description, the better! I'm looking for someone can write as  much  as me (2 to 4 paragraphs or more) and really bring the story to  life. I  lose interest if I'm the only one that's invested/enthusiastic  or  coming up with plot ideas. Quality writing makes my heart happy, as  does  world building together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\\\\\*  The  use of real life face claims and joining me in the wonderful world  of  ship/character development isn't a requirement but I'd sure be  delighted  if we were on the same page in this regard. (I won't use  anime faces,  only art if you're uncomfortable with real life)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\\\\\* I'm looking for the long term here, and I hope you will be too. I've had stories going for months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf  you've made it this far, thank you! You won't be disappointed in  writing with me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOriginal Genres:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\\\\\* Mafia/Crime\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\\\\\* Post Apocalyptic/Dystopia\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\\\\\* Supernatural/Modern Fantasy\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\\\\\* Southern/Mid-Western/Urban Gothic\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\\\\\* Modern Mythology/Fairytale Retellings\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\\\\\* Sci-fi\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\\\\\* Cyberpunk/Retro-Futuristic\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\\\\\* Superpowers/Gifted\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll  my characters will be adults and I require my partners to do the same.  For plot and more genre ideas, please message me \\\\\\^\\\\\\^ I prefer to write  over email but use discord for chatting and writing, along with google  docs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease   be detailed when you message me, let me know why you chose to contact   me. Seeing \"hey do you wanna rp?\" is a guaranteed way to turn me off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLook forward to hearing from you!",

            "selftext": "This RP is a plot I came up with that can be added to and modified in many ways once the group is formed. It can also be a RP that works 1 on 1, but I thought it'd be fun to do as a group. \n\nThe general plot is, a group of friends who could easily be popular at school if they chose to, but they don't want to be part of the school's hierarchy of rich kids and popularity contests. They choose to spend time with each other rather than with the rich kids they go to school with. \n\nCharacters- Names can be changed, as can minor details, and face claims can be added if the person playing the character chooses to add one. \n\n\u2022Yara James- Yara's dad is the principal of their school. She's liberal and very active in politics, especially local politics. She's bisexual, has an older brother who is away at college, as well as four younger siblings- quadruplets, whom she often babysits to earn an allowance. Her parents would've given her money without her having to work for it, but she insisted on earning it herself. She's a Christian, but very open minded and accepting of all people. Her dream is to make a career in writing and journalism, which she's already starting to do using sites like Wattpad, as well as her own personal blog. Her long time boyfriend, Zach is also a member of the friend group. \n\n\u2022Zachary \"Zach\" Adams- Zach lives with his mother and sister. They don't have much, but are able to keep their home after their father's death, due to their grandparents assisting them financially and with house payment. His best friend is his younger sister, Leyton, who is also close friends with Yara and her family. \n\n\u2022Leyton Adams- Leyton is a year younger than Zach. She loves to okay video games and hosts a podcast online that is relatively popular. She has a boyfriend, who was her best friend for years before they began dating. \n\n\u2022Elton Rhodes- Elton comes from a rich and snobbish family, but he is nothing like them. He's very kind and smart, also quite shy. He's been dating Leyton since middle school and is certain he'll marry her someday. Despite being painfully shy, he appears on Leyton's podcast often, and is well liked by hee followers. \n\n\u2022Rose Ortiz- Rose moved to town halfway through freshman year. Her parents are both very unique individuals who travel around the country often as part of a cult-like group they're involved in. Rose wants nothing to do with it, but fears telling her parents that. \n\n\u2022Sampson \"Sam\" Nichols- Sam is a smart, creative, and funny guy. He's rich, but lives humbly. He's pansexual, but closeted due to his family's homophobia. He came out to his friends when he was young, but likely won't come out to his family any time soon. He has a major crush on Rose at the moment, but is afraid to admit it. He stands for animal rights and is very active in protests and campaigns for his cause. His younger brother is autistic, and he's very protective of him. His brother, Tommy, hangs out with the group often, but usually prefers being alone due to shyness.\n\n-Roleplay Plot &amp; Rules-\nPlot- It's the summer before college, and most everyone has avoided talking about the idea of leaving for college. The first time it is discussed among any of them is when Leyton discovers she's pregnant, which terrifies her. The first people she tells are Rose and Yara, who are both very supportive. She then tells Elton, who, despite Leyton's fears, is excited about being a father. They both are happy, and eventually tell their group of friends before the thought of college even crosses their minds. This leads them to fear more, once they realize they'll have to deal with parenting, along with college once the Summer ands, and the baby is born. \n\nThe plot described above will be acted out in the roleplay, that's just the prompt. Again this can also work as a one on one roleplay, I just think it'd be very fun as a group. The group will likely be on Discord, but possibly text. Not Kik since that's being shut down soon.

            "selftext": "(It's very important to me that anyone interested read everything before messaging me. Thanks!)\n\n**About Me**\n\nAnyway! Hi, I'm Aterose and currently looking for a long term roleplay partner, though that much is obvious. I\u2019m a nineteen-year-old (twenty in a few months if that counts for anything) female living in the EST timezone. I have about 8-9 years of writing experience and consider myself pretty literate.\n\n**What I\u2019m Searching For**\n\n* Literacy. I prefer to roleplay with someone who can write at least two to three paragraphs minimum. The two of us should be going well over Discord's 2000 character limit.\n* Willing to chat OOC. I find it important to have a friendship with my partners as well as discussing future plots for our roleplay.\n* Must play both male and female characters.\n* Third-person only \n* Romance. Our roleplay won't revolve around romance but more so our plot. If our characters are hitting it off though I'm all for it.\n* Patience. I work 4-5 days a week so don\u2019t ask me when I\u2019m going to reply next, I can\u2019t stress this enough. \n\n**What I Will Not Do** \n\n* Smut (I prefer to fade to black)\n* Modern\n* Historic\n* Canon characters (From you or me) \n* Fandoms. Unless I have seen/read/played the fandom and the plot is good enough. This is a big maybe though. Roleplays inspired by fandoms is fine. \n\n**What I\u2019m Interested In**\n\n* Sandbox! I\u2019m all for sandbox. It leaves a ton of room to do whatever we want. I almost always do dystopian future settings and possibly some fantasy thrown in there.\n* I have an idea that I've been dying to do. It's inspired by Stephenie Meyer's \"The Host\". My character would be an alien that had just inhabited the body of your childhood friend (I would like this character to be male). This results in him being taken. I was thinking that your character belongs to a group of survivors that live below the city. These people find their converted loved ones and try to revert the alien inside them to get them back. The twist is the aliens I voluntarily took the hosts. If you're interested in this (which I'm really hoping you are) then I can give more details in DMs. \n* Another idea I have is less detailed but we can figure it out along the way. The government has fallen due to a force we can discuss. There was chaos, death, and destruction. A large town/small city decided to come together and form their own government, only they couldn't come to an agreement as well so they split the city in half. Our characters are on opposite sides. We can decide what their goal is, whether that be putting an end to the dispute or something else. \n* Other than that I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m interested in right now, I\u2019ve been branching out due to partners having some pretty amazing ideas so I guess I\u2019ll just continue with that. Just throw whatever ideas you got at me and we can figure something out!\n\nIf you're interested or just have questions shoot me a message with your ideas and a little bit of information about yourself. I will not respond to chat requests or \"Still looking?\". Also, if you've read everything add your favorite color to your message. Hope to hear from you soon!",

            "selftext": "First of all, a bit about me. I am an experienced, mature RPer who has a number of years of experience in different formats, including face-to-face, email, forums and the like. Primarily, I am interested in character interaction and development, especially through storytelling, conversation and relationship building. I like to see well developed, well thought out and believable characters. I prefer exotic or unusual settings, primarily science fiction, cyberpunk or post-apocalyptic. \u201cReal world/slice of life\u201d scenarios aren\u2019t that interesting to me; if it's something like a military or espionage setting, maybe, but not something 'mundane'. With that being said, I\u2019m open to ideas if they\u2019re original or creative or a little unusual.\n\nI generally like well-written, well thought out posts, and definitely prefer quality over quantity. I don\u2019t want to read a novel with each post, but I don\u2019t want to see one-line-wonders. Similarly, I am a stickler for grammar and spelling and punctuation, although I am prone to the odd bout of ferocious typos myself. However, as long as the intent is there, then I\u2019m happy.\n\nMy interests lie in mutual storytelling and creativity, rather than playing along to somebody else\u2019s story or the like. I control my character, I decide what\u2019s going on with them, I create their background and so on. I ask for my partners to respect that, as I will do the same for them. Likewise, I will never launch a major story element or a plot twist or the like without okaying it with a partner, as I would expect them to do the same for me. If I do something a partner doesn't want, then I'll gladly change it, but I ask that they will do the same for me.\n\nI\u2019m flexible as to settings and backgrounds. I am currently looking for **Sci-Fi**, **Cyberpunk** and **Post-Apocalyptic** RP in original settings. I am also interested in fandom RPs based on **Star Wars**, **Battletech/Mechwarrior, Shadowrun** and **Fallout**, but only using OCs. I am **only** looking for one-on-one RP, not groups or Player/GM experiences.",

I know I would like there to be some sort of romantic element, which often includes smut which I dont mind but don't want it to be the center of the story. I was thinking something like two Tenno exploring ruins and fighting in whatever their main chosen warframe is. Im fine with story bending and would love to craft a story! A few things I like in a roleplay is a emphasis on communication and making sure were both getting what we want out of the roleplay! Im on the East Coast, and enjoy a few posts a day often around 2 paragraphs. I do enjoy dark themes and such so 18+ please, and so on. So if anything of this sounds interesting Message me on here and we can talk some stuff over before moving to Discord! :D  \n\n\nAlso a few things to add! Im not asking that you still be playing warframe or anything but I would like you to have gotten far enough to be somewhat familiar with the basic lore. The story is something we can craft together, the basic plot i have is two tenno with there main warframes do jobs and stuff in the galaxy.",

I got the big A(nxiety) and the slightly smaller D(epression), and writing tends to be my easiest way to escape, since I very much live myself into the character(s) I play, imagining how they\u2019d act in the situation and trying to make them seem as realistic as possible(so, no sudden character changes/big leaps, but rather longer-term change happening slowly). Most of my characters are trans so you kinda gotta be ok with that for this to happen!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow that introductions are out of the way, here\u2019s what I\u2019m looking for! :)\n\nI only rp on Discord as it\u2019s the easiest platform for me to use for this kind of thing(Reddit messaging hates me), I mostly do MxM pairings(cis or straight, idc), but have done a few with gender non-conforming characters too, and quite enjoyed it! \n\nI\u2019m looking for either a fantasy, sci-fi, or \u201crealistic\u201d roleplay, preferably with some romance thrown in at some point, but it doesn\u2019t have to be the main focus of the roleplay(I\u2019m also ok with 18+ themes, as long as my partner is also over 18.). I don\u2019t have any specific plots in mind, as I prefer discussing and brainstorming with a partner to end up with something we\u2019ll both enjoy, but I tend to lean towards plots that include drama such as: running from someone/something(government, criminals, family, a terrible unknown danger\u2026), strangers who get thrown together and have to decide if they can really trust each other or if they need to run before it\u2019s too late, and similar things. I love plots that have 1 big end-goal, then multiple smaller goals or \u201cside-tracks\u201d along the way(ex. Big goal: getting away from an oppressive government. Small goal: getting out of the big city, changing their identities. Side-tracks: character Y gets badly injured at one point and Character X needs to get help without alerting guards of their location, A loses something of sentimental value and runs back for it, leaving B lost in an area they don\u2019t know\u2026)\n\nAs for my partner. I\u2019d prefer someone over 18, and my absolute lowest limit is 16 as I don\u2019t feel too comfortable roleplaying with someone very much younger than me. I\u2019d prefer someone whom is happy to share ideas, brainstorm, and just generally chat about the plot to drive it forwards when needed. I\u2019d love someone who\u2019d be able to chat outside the rp as well so it wouldn\u2019t feel so much like a stranger on the other side of the screen(Not saying we\u2019d have to be bffs, but I\u2019d like to be able to share some real-life stuff, and know my partner\u2019s name/location/favourite things)\n\nPlease message me if you\u2019re interested :)",

I've been around for a while now but I'm looking for something new and interesting to do with somebody.\n\nTypically when I roleplay, I have a generic story idea ready, usually with a certain endgame in mind, and the plots are typically quite lengthy. This isn't a roleplay that will be finished in a week. For this RP, I want to take a bit of inspiration from the Hunger Games series and have our characters face off in a magic battle royale! Our characters will be magic-users from different dimensions (this allows us to use any magic systems we want), fighting each other in a magical environment. Depending on the circumstances, we could team up or be rivals pitted against each other until the very end. My character will be a prince of a magic kingdom, stripped from his home to be forced into playing the game, but has nothing to do with who you have to play.   \n\n\nAlso, romance is never necessarily the focus in my stories, but I have absolutely no problem exploring any themes/motifs you want to. Your gender, or your character's, don't really matter to me, either. Just please be literate and have a fun character that doesn't come with hella restrictions and weird applications to their powers. I just wanna be wizards, man. Don't come to me with some weird stuff like, \"I was thinking my character could draw power from the Moon Goddess, a giant dragon lady who grants him the power to turn his foot into a rocket launcher. Also, he has spirit wings made out of celestial energy and he can breathe blue magma, which allows him to freeze and melt anything simultaneously.\"   \n\n\n***I. Just. Want. To. Be. Wizards.***  \n\n\nI would prefer that your character be an experience magic-user, as my character is, and because I'm tired of being the one to always push the story forward because of significant power discrepancies. I don't really see why people give their characters a million limitations when the whole point of RP is creating a fun and creative story. The only restriction I'll place on your character is that I ask that you play anyone but an elf (for reasons I can disclose if you ask). I also ask that you comply with the few things I do ask of you.\n\n**Must**:\n\n\\- Have Discord.\n\n\\- Type in detailed, grammatically-correct sentences. Don't even bother DMing me if you aren't literate-advanced literate.\n\n\\- Type in 3rd person.\n\n\\- Be flexible with the RP. Remember, this will take place in a fantasy world that has already been fleshed out. We won't be doing much to add to the already-existing lore.\n\n\\- Be able to communicate on a consistent basis. If you're too busy to send in a reply every day, that's totally fine. I just want to be able to know what's up if that's the case.\n\n\\- Read all the rules I send before we start, and communicate any you may have with me.\n\n\\- Already have a pic/multiple pics you want to use for your character when you message me (preferably dressed in magical wizard-witchy fantasy garbs for consistency's sake); must not be realistically drawn, as I drew my OC myself. I will only wait an hour or two for you to create your character. Don't make me wait - come with that already prepared.\n\nIf this doesn't interest you, I'm also down to do a generic wizard school RP, where my character is a foreign exchange student from his homeland. That way, I wouldn't really have to change my character around much and you could still make any type of magical character you wanted. If you're down, I'm excited to see what we can write together. Just PM me your Discord user and we can get started!",

Anyways, to get the formalities out of the way, I'm looking for players that are over 18 due to the likelihood and presence of NSFW content.  Just ask that you give me something to work with for posts, and with that out of the way, let's get started!\n\nAs the title would say, I'm looking for some lovely ladies to help scratch a Star Wars itch I've been stuck with and I have two plots.  The first plot is set in the time of The Old Republic, specifically during the Galatic Cold War that is the setting for the Star Ward Old Republic MMO.  Specifically, I'm looking for us to take a ride on the Dark Side and would love if you could be the Sith Master to my apprentice.  I got a few ideas for how we can go, but a little about my character is that he discovered that he was powerful in the Force and was sent to the academy on Korriban, where while struggling against having the deck severely stacked against him, he impresses your Lord and she takes him as his apprentice.\n\nThe second plot that I had would be set in the new trilogy, with you playing as Rey while I use a bounty hunter OC I've been working in.  I actually like how naive and innocent Rey is, and would love to explore how she rubs off on a cynical and snarky bounty hunter.\n\nAt any rate, I hope to hear from you all soon!",

Thanks for checking out my post, first of all I would like to say I roleplay on discord and I am free most of the time so I can reply pretty quickly and I expect the same, while I understand life can happen I expect a warning or a heads up before disappearing. I hate ghosting, so if you are going to ghost don\u2019t even bother messaging.\n\nWhen it comes to Roleplaying, I do it in thirdperson and I wrote at least a paragraph and a detailed responses and I expect the same. I understand sometimes it needs to be quicker I would be happy if you tried to keep it detailed and good. Quality over quantity though. I expect you to sometimes roleplay npc\u2019s as well, I will too of course. \n\nAs for the plot, I like dark themes and drama, I can tell you more about them if you want to know more about it. But basically I have some plot Ideas in mind, whichever you would prefer I am happy to discuss.\n\nThe Roleplay Ideas:\n\u2022 Girl in a band.\n\u2022 Veterinarian girl and a patient. \n\u2022 Two young teens ran away together after a crime ans have to disguise and act like siblings.\n\nThanks for reading this far, just to make sure you\u2019ve read all of the post  put your favourite colour on the title of your dm. (also don\u2019t respond to the post or send a chat, JUST DM!)\n\nThanks, Take Care~",
