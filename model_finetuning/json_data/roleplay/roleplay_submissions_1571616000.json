I have had the same experience a few times. \n\n**Now that this is said, here's my offer:**\n\n\\- I am an avid roleplayer, literate, and write in novella style.\n\n\\- I am 18+ and frequently post\n\n\\- I will be willing to write in any genre\n\n\\- I can bring some of my own ideas to the table (however, this is about YOU.)\n\nLet's say you have a really good RP revolving around a medieval princess and a criminal, but your roleplay partner abandoned it/ ghosted you. I can fill in that space (you just let me know what's happening/ where you left off) and I will do my best to recreate this world with you.\n\nThis is NOT an ad for NEW roleplays where we world-build together. This is for abandoned roleplays where YOUR (and your previous partners) ideas are being discussed and remodeled to fit the new/continued RP.\n\nAll I am looking for is your abandoned idea and what character you want me to RP, and I will do my best to fill that void. Preferably, I would like you to send me your previous RP (if it's on discord, add me to the server; if on google docs, share it with me.. etc, just so I can know how the RP started/ where it ended).\n\nThanks for taking your time to read this, and I can't wait for your responses :)",

I'd hate for all that work to go to waste, so send me your plots and let's try to breathe some new life into your idea!\n\nHonestly, my least favorite part of roleplaying is conceptualizing. Sometimes the thought of completely building a plot from the ground up is exhausting, so bring me YOUR ideas and we'll run with it. If you want me to play a specific character that you had in mind, I will, if you want me to fit one of my own into your world, I can do that as well.\n\nI mostly prefer fantasy and/or medieval plots, but if you've got an interesting slice of life plot, send them over! I also love darker themes, horror elements and so much more, though I'm not really big on fandoms. \n\nA little about me, I'm 26, female from the states. I've been roleplaying on and off for 11ish years now. Discord is my preferred platform for roleplaying and I'm completely fine with adult themes, so you'll have to be 18+. \n\nI look forward to hearing from you. Let's resurrect some roleplays!",

Therefore, we're looking for semi-lit/literate roleplayers who enjoy high fantasy settings and wanna meet a bunch of new people! If you are interested, slide into my DMs and I'll send you an invite:)\n\n  \nA few things about the server:  The Legend of Rhothen is a high fantasy server set in medieval times, with a twist of magic.  The story begins in the heart of the kingdom, the Rhothian Capital city, where people of all races and backgrounds coexist. A safe haven for the hunted, a playground for the hunters.  The lore is simple and gives players the creative freedom to either mold their character from it, or mold it to fit their character. Power-playing is okay by us, as long as you can prove you are a fair power player who doesn't exploit their power. There's no limitations to races/species. We are LGBT+ friendly (most of us are hella gay). And, we like to write. So if you like to write too, come say hello! :)",

            "selftext": "Hi,  recently I've been wanting to RP something that was more wholesome. I  want to write about an abandoned kid who gets adopted by someone in  various settings. The RP would be a mix of slice of life and  adventure/action. Specifically, what I would like to do is a fantasy  medieval world where demons are hated, for well, being demons. However,  all the other races believe demons are born evil. Yet, however, it is a  learned trait, and your character, whether it be a princess, a warrior, a  merchant, or just a poor peasant, finds a child, clearly a demon,  wounded, hurt, and scared.\n\nI'm  100% okay for trying to come up with other various scenarios for this.  I'd prefer for daughter and mother, but father daughter is perfectly  okay. Nevertheless, if you are interested in this, please PM me. I use  Discord.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBring any prompts however, cuz I really just wanna have a wholesome, heartwarming RP with a kid. Thank you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What to expect from me;**\n\n* Multi Paragraph Posting\n* Decently Open Schedule (EST Timezone)\n* Somewhat frequent posting, my muse goes and comes\n* A huge nerd that you can talk to about anything.\n* And hopefully a friend.\n\n**What to expect from you;**\n\n* Truthfully,     I want anyone and everyone who is even remotely interested to reach    out  to me. I love meeting new people, learning different styles, and    just  seeing the ideas that people put out on the table. All I would    wish from  you is matching my posts and to be a friendly person!",

My true creative passion is to build my own worlds, with vast histories, rich ecologies, and functioning economies, and then letting others explore them, allowing the obstacles they provide me to enrich the settings I've made. Together, we'll build a new story in my world, post by post, with your character as the protagonist. Due to the ever-shifting sands of the wasteland that is the real world, it's been some time since I've been able to do this and so I have lost contact with all of my former creative partners. I'm here to find new ones.\n\n\u200b\n\nI feel no need to over-complicate or embellish the rest of this post. I'll have no issue setting to rest the doubts of even the most demanding role-play partners, so here's what I'm looking for and here's what I have to offer.\n\n**Requirements**\n\n*Any age is fine, but 18+ is preferred. All of my content is tailored to each partner's wishes, and I've no issue factoring in physical or mental maturity.\n*You should be comfortable with writing multiple paragraphs with each post. There won't always be a need for that much content in a post, and that's fine, but it should be the norm.\n*Bring an OC or be prepared to build one that fits whichever setting you'll be playing within. Even in my rare fandom role-plays, I much prefer my role-play partners to play as an OC.\n**Current Genres**\n\n*Fantasy - Low/Dark/Epic\n*Historical - Classical/Medieval/19th *Century/20th Century/Alternate History\n*Sci-Fi - Hard/Soft/Space Opera/Cyberpunk/Steampunk/Post-Apocalyptic/Zombie/Superhero\n*Crime\n*Supernatural\n**Contact**\n\nSo, if you're interested, just send me a message or start a chat with me. Tell me about yourself, the genres and themes you'd like, as well as any possible OCs you might already have or would like to build. You can ask me any questions and we'll sort out the details there.",

            "selftext": "Hello, I have posted here a few times in the past and have found one or two great partners each time. As goofy as it sounds, I didn't think roleplay could be as fun as some of these people help me make it. Well because I am always wanting more and everyone isn't always as available as myself, I am seeking a few more writing partners.\n\nI like to write just about anything. The settings I have the most experience with are Fantasy type, so if you want someone who thinks they can do that well then I am your man. For me, that means if you have another type of setting that really calls to you please don't hesitate. I want to learn and improve all the time! \n\nA little bit about myself: I am 19 and male and I only play male characters as my main character; however, I am always willing to play just about anyone as a side character. I am a student who currently has a lot of free time and really devotes myself to this. On average my posts rank at 2-3 paragraphs, but I don't write filler. I don't like to have a minimum post length either. \n\n What I am searching for in a partner is pretty simple.\n\n1. Someone creative. This is my advertisement, yes. This is a partnership and just like any relationship one person giving 100% just is not going to work.\n2. Someone interesting. I would like to casually write to one another between messages. We do not have to be best friends or even learn one another's names, but I want to know I am writing with someone interesting or frankly I won't be invested.\n3. Someone who cares. People make mistakes all the time, and that's okay. I am looking for someone who is okay with me making mistakes but also types as though she cares. I don't like setting a minimum length requirement because it isn't always necessary or handy but I do like enough content that I can build upon every response.\n\nIf you're still interested after that wall of text please send me a message. I would love to give writing with you a shot.",

            "selftext": " \n\nGood evening and thank you for stopping by. As the title stated I am looking for some literate roleplayers to start up some scenes with. I have been roleplaying for a decade by this point and I always love a good story. Yet I find myself lacking when it comes to the number of people I can do a good roleplay with. So I thought I might cast myself out into the wide expanse of reddit to see if I might find some diamonds amidst the rough.\n\nTo start with, I will say that all characters should be 18+. Roleplays do not need to be explicit but if it naturally progresses to that it can be enjoyable. I ask that you be able to post at least a paragraph. I don't expect multi-paragraph posts for simple things like conversations and such but I do like good details to bounce off of. And lastly, be able to have fun with it. Do not force yourself to do anything you don't want to do or don't like just for the sake of it.\n\nNow as for some ideas I have a number of them... to start with I will just write out some non-OC pairings that I have had thoughts about roleplaying, and after that some original ideas I have for OCs. I prefer to play as Male characters paired with a female character, but can also do a female on female.\n\n1. Spider-Man x Spider-Gwen\n2. Venom x Spider-Gwen\n3. Iron Man x Your Choice\n4. X-Men OCs\n5. RWBY OCs/Non\n6. My Hero Aca. OCs/Non\n7. Fire Emblem OCs/Non\n8. Princess Peach x Bowser\n9. Mass Effect OCs/Non\n10. Garrus x Tali \\[Mass Effect\\]\n11. Star Wars OCs\n12. Gundam OCs/Non\n\nOriginal ideas: (small snippets of larger prompts)\n\n1. A new digital age is just around the corner with advancements in VR technology allowing for full immersion drives into the virtual worlds of your choosing. VRcades are becoming more popular as the costs of VR capsules skyrocket, with people instead renting time from the VRcades to dive into their virtual fantasies under special time compression. This setting has multiple possible story points.\n2. In the span of two weeks the world had gone from a fertile land to a graveyard. Almost all life simply shriveling up and dying off. Those who survived were the ones to discover the leylines, the last remnants of the mystic energy that had been sustaining life on this world. Now what fertile lands that exist along the leylines are dedicated to farms, with cities built st the crossing of leylines. Yet this dystopian future is one of dark cruelty as the separation of classes keeps the people apart in this steampunk/fantasy world.\n3. Not everyone is cut out to be a super hero. In fact, it almost seems like the people who are most likely to spontaneously activate their latent powers are those who have been pushed to the edge. What would happen to a world where only those who have been pushed to the breaking point develop super powers? The beaten, the downtrodden, the forgotten? If the city of Kiven is any example...humanity is in for a rough time.\n4. Demons walk among us. Living in the hearts of your closest friends...maybe even members of your family. They are indistinguishable from other humans...and they may not even realize their true nature themselves. Not until they turn. It is up to the Inquisitors to try and find and root out these demons, and when it is too late...then it is their jobs to put the lost souls to rest, and may God have mercy on their soul...\n\nIn truth I could go on and on listing ideas. If you want to hear more ideas or hear more about anything I have listed, send me a message. I look forward to hearing from you.",

First of all, you\u2019ve gotta be okay playing both male and female characters. We are writers here! You should feel comfortable doing both. I am comfortable being men, women, LGBT, anything as long as it fits the storyline. \n\n2. I like character heavy roleplaying. So that means anything of up to 2-8 main characters per roleplay plus NPC\u2019s as well (background characters we both control). It\u2019s so much fun having some variety! \n\n3. Be creative, put some effort in. Let\u2019s brainstorm a roleplay together! Let\u2019s come up with stuff to keep it interesting. And if you\u2019re fed up or bored let me know so we can work out a way to keep it going, or we give up and try something new. \n\n4. I expect some level of literacy. But I\u2019m not going to insult you. As long as you know basic sentence structure and grammar I think we will be fine. \n\nI am happy to roleplay on any medium, I\u2019ve done it via email, skype , or google docs, I\u2019m happy to do it via Reddit or Discord as well. Let me know what\u2019s easiest for you. \n\nMy current idea that\u2019s floating in my head is a Deserted Island type roleplay. Survivors of a plane crash. But to be honest I\u2019m open to most things! Fantasy, reality, based on a tv or movie (as long as I\u2019ve seen it) so just let me know what\u2019s in your head and we can work together. \n\nHope to hear from you!",

            "selftext": "\nAlfred's foot caught on a gnarled root as he made his way towards the cabin in the clearing, causing him to tumble forward, arms flailing like a windmill caught in a hurricane. Half of his supplies came tumbling out of the little leather sack he carried with him, spilling all over the brush and making a dreadful racket. Sheepishly, he glanced around the clearing, terrified the witch might have already caught sight of him and judged him a fool. He relaxed somewhat when he realized that he appeared to be alone. He straightened his rough linen tunic and scrabbled over the rocks and dirt without an ounce of grace and hastily shoved the items back where they belonged, save a piece of hard cheese that had acquired several layers of decaying leaves in the chaos. He tossed it aside with a sigh, and focused on the small cottage in the clearing.\n\nIt looked like any other cottage, although a close observer might note that the plants were of an odd and indiscernible nature. If Alfred had been a trained botanist, he would have realized he was unable to recognize a single one. But being neither particularly observant nor particularly fond of agriculture (perhaps the only thing duller than oviculture in his estimation), Alfred didn't pick up on this at all. He did notice that the bees buzzing about the flowers seemed larger and more purple than any he had seen before, but one had to expect some oddness at a witch's hut. He trekked across the little clearing, past several small gardens and a quaint little pond, until he reached the door. Alfred took a deep breath.\n\nThis moment was a long time coming. He was five years old when he first expressed that he wanted to be a witch. And why not? There was hardly anything more interesting to do in the village, or even in the world than study magic. Boys should be wizards, he was told, but no wizards came within a hundred miles of his home, and even if they had, everyone knew only the well off could afford to study \\*real\\* wizardry. If he couldn't be a wizard, why shouldn't he be a witch? The teasing had been so relentless that he never mentioned it again. But the idea continued to burn in his mind, every time he found himself staring into the blank eyes of a filthy sheep.\n\nNow he was of age, old enough to be taken on legally as an apprentice anywhere he chose, without his parents' permission. So far, nobody had expressed much interest in him. He was, to be frank, not a particularly attractive candidate for any profession, at least not at first glance. He was a bit short for his age, yet still somehow managed to seem as though his arms and legs were a bit too long for his body. When he stood up, he seemed to be momentarily made entirely of knees. He was often taciturn and blunt when he did speak, which people mistook for stupidity. Nobody had shown any interest in him when his father took him to the tradesman's fair at the beginning of the summer. Now, as the autumn leaves began to fall, most positions were filled, and it seemed like he would by default end up apprenticed to his father, becoming another shepherd in a long line of shepherds.\n\nAlfred shuddered at the thought. He reached up and pulled off his wide-brimmed peasant hat, took a deep breathe, and knocked on the witch's door.\n\n==========================\n\nLooking for someone to play out this scenario as the witch, open to your ideas! I don't demand any particular length or style, but i'm most comfortable writing in 3rd person, about 2-4 paragraphs at a time. Hope to hear from you!",

After meeting a guy that went through the same situation i reinvented myself as a cool jock type and transferred to your school. \n\nCriminal enterprise: Your mom and my mom were bestfriends. She helped pay for you mom's medicine when she was sick. When your mom finally passed you came to live with us. When you get here you realize we're one of the country's most successful crime families. \n\nSingle parent: This is one is pretty straight forward. We can discuss different options in PM.\n\nUnexpected pregnancy: We met at a party and got drunk and hooked up. We didn't talk afterwards until you called me telling me your pregnant. \n\nSmall town living: you were always a good respectable person. You always saw the good in people but sometimes that wasn't necessarily a good thing. You dated a guy that seemed fine to everyone except behind closed doors he was extremely abusive. When you came home one day with a broken nose and a black eye your parents knew they needed to do something. They decided to send you to live with your aunt to hopefully hide you from him.\u00a0 You were relieved to be away from hom finally. When you get to your aunt's farm you see me working out in the fields. \n\nSuperpower: Ever since i was 5 i knew i was different but no one ever told me why. I came from a long line of shapeshifters unfortunately that's usually what got them killed. Both my dad and uncle were shifters but they mysteriously died when i was 5. My mother started to see the signs of me becoming one the animal print started to show on my body and she knew she couldn't go through with it. When i was 6 she turned me over to foster care and disappeared. Now I'm 22 and using my gift for more personal gain. Rather it be changing into a horse betting on myself at the local track or a championship caliber race dog. You've been passed a file on me to try and bring me in to try and stop a criminal mastermind from trying the world into chaos. \n\nReconnect: I've been bestfriends with your older brother since we were in kindergarten. We're both sophomores in college and play football for the school. You and me always had a connection but never acted on it. Now it's your brother's wedding and we meet up when you see my smoking out by my truck.",

I am so tired- I feel like I'm on Tinder or something, don't just swipe at first glance please.\n\n**Please read the ad.** Yes, I do have a couple of requirements and that is to avoid unnecessary steps. Please make sure that 1) you meet the request and 2) that you're actually up for writing with me. Do not send me a message and say you're up for whatever, or you just want to get started now without virtually any clue what the request is about nor are you even willing to share some ideas. Please. Please. Please. Why is it so hard to get people to read the full ad? **The full ad.** \n\nAgain, the search continues. \n\n**Requests:**\n\n* I'm looking for someone ***literate and*** ***around my age range-late 20s to 30s***  and enjoys roleplay just much as I do- whether rapid fire or novella. hope you understand, I just want us to relate more OOC.\n* I do prefer an average of 3 paragraphs per post and I only roleplay on ***Discord***.\n* I also prefer writing in the ***third person and past tense***\\- and so should you. Also, no animations or cartoons for character faces- I work with either descriptions or actual faces. I hope you understand.\n* I only play heterosexual females though. I also prefer a 65-35 story-smut ratio. (Story &gt; Smut). Yes, I do like writing mature themes, but lets focus on the story more; I think it makes for a ***richer writing experience***. I also make (either brief or detailed) character profiles and you should be able to as well. Please refrain from referring to our characters as if they were us- that makes me very uncomfortable. They are characters we wish to play. I am not roleplaying for the purpose of projection. \n* And yes, I do adore romance. Writing romance is fun and ***I want to actually explore it*** with and write more than just the usual. I can do fluff, I can do dark- but I want a riveting, passionate, can't explain type of romance where my partner and I can find ourselves seemingly glued to our keyboards almost every day. That is what I'm looking for- and I hope you are as well.\n* I want for my words to once again have passion. I like to dive deep into every human emotion and blur those lines. Imagine, just imagine, the ***stories*** we would tell.\n\n**I can write in a variety of settings and either of these work for me.**\n\n* Marvel|DC (Comics/ X-Men/MCU/DCEU) \\[Canons x Canons / OC x OC\\] \n* Modern Slice of Life (City, University, Political, Medical, Wrestling, Crime etc.)\n* Supernatural/Horror (Original or Fandom)\n\nPlease tell me you read this and that you're out there.",

I have tried my hand at male characters once or twice. I don't know if I'm good at the male characters, but I never heard any complaints. \n\n**Age**: Old enough to remember when the Berlin Wall fell\n\n**Seeking**: What am I not looking for? I could probably fill up the profile with rants about the things I don't want to see in a partner, but I won't.\n\n* Someone who isn't going to waste my time after we've spent time plotting\n* Someone who isn't going to spent a week or two writing with me then disappear without notice\n* Someone who likes to plot\n* Someone who is witty\n* Someone who can help the story along and even be evil with me (because sometimes I feel evil and want to torment my characters).\n\n**Frequency**: I try for once a day, but it depends on my schedule. Weekends are eh..Sundays are usually okay. Holidays can be questionable. Please keep this in mind: I am currently dealing with an autoimmune disease that flares when it is most inopportune, so there may be some delay in responses. I do my best to warn, but the flares happen when I least expect it. \n\n**Medium**: Email. I don't use IM programs as I'm not at my computer all the time. It gives me a chance to post a well thought out reply too. \n\n**Writing Style**: 3rd person, paragraph style.\n\n**Timezone**: Central Time Zone\n\nRoleplay Background: 10+ years playing mostly via email, AOL and on Yahoo groups before they changed.\n\n**Original Universes Y/N**: Definitely Original Universes. Not into fandoms\n\n**Themes of Interest**:   Sci-fi, Post-Apocalyptic, Dystopian\n\n**Theme Blacklist and/or limits**: I roleplay to get away from life for a little bit, not revisit it. Limits can be discussed if we choose to write together. \n\n**Misc**: I know the question will come up so I'll just put it here - yes, I will write smut. However, I'd prefer a 50/50 story and smut. I don't fade to black. Yes, I do double.\n\nI'm looking for someone who is 18+ for obvious reasons. I have my limits, and can share them with you. I'm friendly, I don't bite (hard). Just PM me here to talk and we can take it from there if we mesh well. \n\nI didn't think I'd have to add this part, but...If I haven't heard from you within a week (7 days or more), I will assume that you have lost interest. I'm not sure how to put this other than, drop me a line if you have lost interest.

Here's a fun list. \n\u2606fantasy adventure. Let's go slay dragons, hunt demons, run dungeons and have an all out fun time. Let's make a name for ourselves or die trying. \n\u2606Post Apocalyptic. Think Mad Max meets Fall Out, or even Horizon: Zero Dawn, or Nier Automata. Let's adventure through the ruins of worlds and discover things, fight enemy tribes and save the world. \n\u2606Vampires. Let's have some fun. It can be dark and gruesome, with lots of gore and vampire hunters, or light and humorous. I don't mind. \n\u2606Greek Mythology. I love all things Greek mythology. Let's have some fun and write stuff based on it. Are the gods living on earth? Are they working in a school for demigods? Let's find out. \n\u2606Demon Slayer. Let's play in the world of Demon Slayer. Will they be new slayers? A pillar and a demon teamed up? Let's find out. \n\u2606Danmachi. Let's choose a familia and venture through the dungeon. Time to level up and find our way. \n\u2606Parasyte. Perhaps our characters both ended up living with a Parasyte? Does one help the other? Are they enemies? Who knows \n\u2606Vinland Saga. Let's be Vikings. Travel around, pillage, go to war. Are we on the right side? Are we on the wrong side? Who knows. \n\nSo, what am I hoping for? \n\u2606you be 18+. I'm uncomfortable writing with anyone underage. \n\u2606please be regularly active. I love writing as much as possible. \n\u2606please be literate. I love long, detailed responses. \n\u2606be okay with talking ooc. I love talking outside of writing. \n\u2606be aware that I do play a lot of video games with my boyfriend. \n\nIf you're interested, send me a DM. \n\n~Sylv",

            "selftext": "\n*Arne sat on the dais in the front of the crowded hall and listened as the English priest prattled on. Despite the chilly autumn air, he sat shirtless, though dozens of silver rings covered his massive arms and swirling tattoos patterned his chest. The Viking Chief watched as the scrawny man raised the burning incense and asked God to bless this treaty, to bring peace, and to deliver the pagans into his Grace. When he was about to launch into another scripture reading, Arne held up is hand and said, in a firm voice, \u201cThat is enough, father. How is that you have only one God and yet you speak to him constantly? Do you not worry of being bothersome to him?\u201d The priest\u2019s face turned red and he opened his mouth to reply, but Arne\u2019s hand went to the hilt of his massive sword, turning it so the metal glistened in the afternoon sun. Instead the priest gave a sigh, and motioned for another clergyman to bring forth the treaty. \u201cHis Lordship Orfred will now sign the\u2026agreement.\u201d*\n\n*The eyes of the room turned to Orfred, the grizzled old Englishking. His face was pale enough to make him look ill, but his sickness was from the thought of the deal he was making. He was signing over the rights to all the lands of the north save for a modest portion of his own estate and the few monasteries in the oceanside cliffs. But what choice did he have? The Vikings had bested him at every turn, with three years of constant raids and pillaging, with famine and misery becoming the norm. And it was all because of Arne, that bear of a man who not only never seemed to falter in battle but also had the shrewdness and intelligence to keep his fractious tribes organized. Orfred\u2019s only choice was to capitulate now and pray for a miracle rather than continue toward total destruction. Hopefully he had already sown the seeds for such a miracle. Hopefully. He spat and stood, taking the quill from the priest.*\n\n*But before he could sign, the doors at the end of the hall burst open. Six wild looking Vikings pushed through the guards and made their way to the front. Tugged behind them were three men and one young woman bound in a line to a single rope. The woman was dressed like a peasant and kept her head low. \u201cJarl, we found a group of them soldiers heading south. They had a bunch of documents like that,\u201d the leader of the group said, pointing to the treaty. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t read it but we got the answers out of one of them quick enough. They were hoping to find allies to the south and were offering the same lands they are giving you now.\u201d Angry shouts erupted from the assembled Vikings, with men starting to shove each other for the chance to take Orfred\u2019s head. The king for his part turned to the Jarl, saying \u201cThis is not news\u2026this was before we agreed to negotiate between us. You cannot blame us for our previous actions during the war\u2026I have agreed to all of your demands and...\u201d*\n\n*Suddenly the young woman shouted, \u201cNo! Father\u2026you can\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry\u2026I know you told me to stay hidden but I can\u2019t and you can\u2019t and and\u2026\u201d she trailed off. There was a shocked stillness in the room. Arne turned to Orfred. \u201cYou never told me you had a daughter,\u201d he said, in a cool voice. \u201cPriest! You who knows all the prayers, you know how to make a marriage blessing too, yes?\u201d He drew his sword and cut the rope, freeing the girl from the other prisoners but leaving her still bound. He pulled her to the front of the room. \u201cWe will be married now, and then the king will proceed with signing the treaty.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cNo! That wasn\u2019t the deal!\u201d The old man seemed on the verge of tears. Arne raised an eyebrow at him, then turned to face the girl. His lips curled into a sly smile. \u201cThe deal has been altered\u201d.*\n\nHello! I\u2019m a female, but for this RP I\u2019ll be playing Arne. I\u2019m looking for a partner to play the English King\u2019s daughter. I\u2019m looking for a literate partner who is 18+, and who can write 1-2, or more paragraphs in third person. I understand that at some point in the Roleplay, the length of responses he slightly shorter due to dialogue.\n\nIf you are interested,  message me and I\u2019ll give you my discord.",

            "selftext": " \n\nHey everyone, my name is Annie and I've been a fan of Marvel for quite some time! I'm pretty familiar with comics (I've read quite a bit), but I base most of my characters off of whatever show/movie they're in. I've been roleplaying for about 8 years now, and writing is one of my passions! Now, let's get down to business. :)\n\nSome characters I play (and who I would be looking for to ship them with):\n\nWanda Maximoff (Vision preferably, Steve Rogers, Stephen Strange, Clint Barton, Carol Danvers, Bucky Barnes, and maybe a couple others. I main her so she\u2019s usually my go to and preferred).\n\nNatasha Romanoff (Steve Rogers and Clint Barton). \n\nKaren Page (Frank Castle). \n\nI'm a pretty simple woman, but I do have some rules:\n\n1. NO OCs! Please only contact me if you want to play a CANON character and please adhere to how the character acts and speaks. I don't want someone who plays Vision to act like a normal man. He's a robot, he's gonna be a little awkward!\n2. Please have correct grammar, punctuation, etc. and be willing to write more than one or two sentences, depending on what is happening. I'm fine with shorter responses, but only if there is a good amount of detail in it!\n3. I like to do pretty NSFW stuff, so please be a little bit older and mature. If you're not comfortable with that but still want to rp, please just tell me! I'll be fine without NSFW material.\n4. Please keep everything in 3rd person pov. Nothing bothers me more than someone writing in 1st person pov.\n\nIf you want to roleplay with me, please message me and I'll be more than happy to give you my Kik, Discord, Tumblr, email, etc.!\n\nWe can start out as literate or do some \u2018texting\u2019 between our characters, but we can discuss it!\n\nThank you for taking your time out of your day to read this!",

            "selftext": "Hello. I'm looking for a new partner, hopefully someone interested in a roleplay that's a bit of a slow burn. \n\nI usually enjoy well-paced roleplays where the characters we play interact in organic and realistic ways. I play male characters, usually the stoic, masculine kind but I'm versatile and I'm able to play against any type of partner. \n\nI have a few ideas in mind and I'll give a few simple prompts here:\n\n\n* I had an idea recently about someone being sent to a secluded chapel to escape their past or turn their life around. The backstories of the characters are up for discussion, but the crux of the roleplay is that the two protagonists are isolated for the most part. There are some supernatural components that come into play like demons and whatnot but we'll talk about it when the time comes.\n\n* The second idea I had has a bit of a horror theme to it. It involves a lawyer defending a man who is accused of killing his wife. I have a whole narrative for this storyline that involves different branches and endings and whatnot. I could explain the plot if you'd like, but it involves the main characters going to the place where the man's wife disappeared, a secluded mountain town, and trying to find evidence of his innocence.\n\nYou can check my past posts for more ideas but I'm more than willing to listen to any you have in mind. My roleplays usually involve a bit of a darker theme, but I don't mind playing something light-hearted and romantic either. \n\nHit me up if you're interested in setting something up. I'm free all day.",

Life happens and I totally get that, but if you're the type of person who can get out one response a day at most, this probably isnt for you.\n\n-Good Literacy! Good grammar, spelling and length (say a few paragraphs on average).\n\n-3rd Person.\n\n-Able to develop character and plot naturally and with attention to detail. We roleplayers are writers, so as long as you put effort into the quality of your content, that's enough for me.\n\n-Mature, friendly and negotiable ooc.\n\n-18+.\n\n-FxFxF or MxMxM. Sorry, I'm currently uninterested in doing a mixed polyamorous relationship roleplay. So when you PM me, make sure to list which you're interested in (or if you dont mind either way).\n\nIf I find two people interested who seem suitable (I may ask for an example of your writing), I'll make us a Discord server where we can further plan together, and create a plot, though there's random throwaway titles/tropes to spark inspiration potentially:\n\nFire/Water/Earth\n\nHuman/Vampire/Werewolf",

            "selftext": "Hello there!\n\nI am currently searching for long term RP partners for some interesting RPs.\n\nA little bit about me:\n\nI am a 20 year old female with about 7 or 8 years of experience and even longer writing experience (~9 or 10). \n\nEST time zone\n\nI RP third person and my responses range anywhere from several paragraphs to even a page depending on what is happening in the RP.  (I also do try to match responses, but my responses also tend to be a bit detailed and on the long side)\n\n**Please be able to give me a well thought out reply. Not just a meager paragraph or a few lines with nothing that I can continue off of**\n\nIf for some reason you grow bored or disinterested please do let me know and we can fix it or try something else completely. \n\nI love chatting outside of RP whether it be about our characters, future plot points, coming up with characters in AU\u2019s or just general chat! Although if that\u2019s not your thing then no worries!\n\nI do have a full time job and have responsibilities after so my responses may be dependent. Often times it can get a bit overwhelming so I apologize if my responses get a bit spotty here and there. I get to them when I can.\n\nFor fandom RPs, I can do canon and OC characters (although I am more used to canon), and I can play both males and females. I also love to RP multiple characters. (more plot devices and interaction that way) \n\nCharacter interaction, development, and world building is a must! I love building things to it\u2019s full potential. \n\nAlso, I do quite enjoy looking at characters from different angles even if that means switching between character POV in the RP, but if you\u2019re more of a one or two character interaction type of person that\u2019s fine, but I certainly don\u2019t mind playing side characters or extras to bring the world to life.\n\nSome games I have played: (I am perfectly fine to play against an OC for any of these!) \n\nI will put asterisks next to ones I am inspired for or that I know the most about.\n\n\nDetroit: Become Human *** \n\u2014I can play any of the canon characters but at the moment I am most interested in a Gavin and RK900, and I could settle for anything with Hank and Connor even including an OC if you preferred as well. I also have several plots in mind for this one.\n\nFinal Fantasy (4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10-2, 13, 13-2, 13-3, 15 and Kingsglaive, Dissidia, Crisis Core) \n\u2014I can play any of the canon characters from these as well! **\n\nTales (Berseria, Xillia, and Graces f) \n\nLegend of Zelda (MM, TP, WW, SS, BOTW) **\n\u2014Canon or OC\n\u2014I do have a plot in mind for something BOTW\n\nTelltales The Walking Dead \n\u2014I do have a plot for this one\n\nThe Last of Us (or similar universe)\n\nNier Automata \n\nSpider-Man (PS4 2018)\n\n\nShows/movies:\n\nMarvel\n\u2014most movies including Spiderverse and also daredevil, not so much comics \n\nSherlock * \n\u2014Canon\n\nMiraculous LB *\n\u2014Canon or OC \n\nRWBY \n\u2014Canon or OC \n\nSword Art Online Arc 1 &amp; 2 (more the universe)\n\nSword Art Online Season 2 (more the universe)\n\nStranger Things ***\n\u2014I do have a plot for this one\n\nAngel Beats *\n\nDarker than Black \n\nOHSHC\n\nIT *\n\nCarnival Row ***\n\u2014&gt; Canon or OCs in the same general universe\n\nHobbs and Shaw **\n\u2014&gt; I\u2019d like to play Hattie or Deckard, or perhaps OCs in the same general setting of MI6, spies etc etc etc. \n\n**Not a complete list of fandoms**\n\n\n\nOriginal ideas I enjoy: (Plot and character ideas depend on your preferences)\n\n\u2014Fantasy (medieval, magical elements, kingdoms, different races, even adding in tech like airships, modern weapons, and exploring more than one and a variety of aspects as well. There\u2019s so much more I could add but it would take forever.)\n\u2014\u2014war themes, royal themes, different aspects of life themes, pirates, bandits, etc etc etc.\n\n\u2014Modern settings and futuristic settings as long as they have some sort of non slice of life or non day to day type aspect. I like action and adventure and excitement in these types of settings. Modern is what I am most searching for in original settings right now. ****\n\n\u2014Supernatural/Fantastical elements\n\n\u2014Romance (MxF and possibly FxF and I DO NOT RP SMUT. More of a fade to black sort of person) I also thoroughly enjoy building it up over time.\n\n\u2014Action/Adventure\n\n\u2014Angst/Drama\n\nFor original plots I\u2019d love to find someone that can build an interesting cast of characters and an equally interesting world with me. Characters that we can both grow to adore and put as much growth into and build different relationships with different dynamics. Worlds with bustling life and lots of different things going on, and a plot that has many twists and turns as we go along! (: \n\nI am sure there are more things I am forgetting. \n\nI would be fine exploring any other sorts of themes/plots genres except Sci-Fi  (depending on the type) and Slice of life (normal themes would need some convincing as I find it difficult to keep it going) as I like some sort of magical or fictional aspect to it. I can be persuaded depending on the plot.\n\nIf you have any other suggestions/ideas/plots/settings as to what you would like to do then please shoot me a PM with a bit about you and your interests and we can discuss! Give me a bit about your interests and preferences! I am open to nearly anything!\n\nIf you need a sample of my writing, please do not be afraid to ask! \n\nMy platforms are Kik, Discord, Skype, Email, Google Docs and Reddit PM",

            "selftext": "I literally couldn't think of a better title than that, I swear.\n\n\nThat aside, Hello! I'm back, today looking for less of a prompt, and more of a...general search? I have no idea. Before I get into the nitty gritty, allow me to say a bit about myself. I'm a 20-something male with plenty of writing experience, about 6ish years or so. I'm the kind of guy who (proudly) sprouts absurd and out there ideas, literally just on a whim or the slightest bit of inspiration. Seriously. Sometimes I can get a little crazy. My post length is anywhere between 1-3 paragraphs, but I came definitely get more out if I'm feeling inspired.  I'm also, for whom it might concern, in the central timezone of the United States. That being said, I have a horrid sleep schedule, so I'll usually be up pretty late into the night.\n\n\nWith that out of the way, let me say what I'm looking for. I am (unsurprisingly) looking for a female partner to nerd out with, 18+ of course, just in case we *do* go down a NSFW road at some point (It's welcome, but I'd like to not to be the focus of anything). **I will not, under any circumstances, write with someone under the age of 18**. I'm not comfortable with it, and I'm sorry if someone out there disagrees with this. Additionally, I'm looking for someone that I can call my friend. All proper and business is boring. I like to freak out with my writing partners. Come up with dumb plotlines or AUs. If you're looking for something strictly professional, I'm probably not your guy.\n\n\n\nFinally, we get down to what I'm *really* gonna be vague on. As you might've guessed by the title, I'm looking for something fantasy related. What specifically, you might ask? I have no clue. I'm a sucker for romance plots, with an epic adventure hanging above our characters' head. Be it slaying gods, or sealing away an ancient evil, I can't get enough of it. I love all sorts of different fantasy races, too. Elves? Oh yeah. Demons? Sure! Any kind of Yokai? *my god, that'll press my buttons in juuust the right way*. That being said, anyone that brings an idea with **Kitsune** as a major emphasis will make me *very* happy. Anyway. If you have any existing ideas, please, throw them at me! I love reading through plots n ideas. Want to create something new? We can chat for a bit, and see what we both like.\n\n\nI'm rambling now, aren't I? I think I've gone on for long enough. If I've caught your eye, please, shoot me a message, and I'll get to you ASAP. I get a lot of messages, so I'm sorry if I don't get to you right away. Some messages also slip through the cracks, or don't follow a certain obvious rule, so sorry on that regard as well. Just be sure to include your favorite color in your title, so I know you got down this far. I won't respond without it, because I don't enjoy it when people don't read my post. Like I said, I'm usually around into the late hours of the night, so you'll likely catch me. Thanks for reading!\n\n\n(Oh, by the way, don't send me a message only saying \"hey I think we can work something out\" or the like. Tell me about yourself, have some energy. Those kind of intros give me life)",

In a nutshell, I'm a veteran of the Yahoo/AIM days of roleplaying. My published work spans a wide range of genres, but recently, I've been feeling a pull back into the world of collaborative writing. There's just something tantalizing about being able to explore unique worlds and scenarios with other like-minded individuals. I'm eager to write and communicate with others who share a similar passion for creating, reading, and producing original content.\n\n**Genres:**\n\nI'm drawn to stories that take an in-depth exploration into character development and character plot arcs. There's something deeply satisfying about following a character's emotional development as a result of interactions with other characters, and/or environmental changes. I'm also drawn to protagonists who challenge the status quo, or that follow unconventional narrative arcs. This can function in a variety of settings, but contemporary fiction, and historical fiction are some of my favorites for this particular approach.\n\n**Basics:**\n\nI'm 29, and gainfully employed. Hopefully you're also someone who understands what it means to balance the \"real world\" with collaborative fiction. I've been roleplaying for several years now (albeit, excluding my recent break), so I'm familiar with expectations for discussion, collaboration, and literary prose.\n\n**Send Me a Message If:**\n\n* You are over 21.\n* You are an advanced/literate writer who enjoys emotional development in characters.\n* You enjoy collaborative mapping of plot arcs.\n* You enjoy the idea of composing a long-term story.",

I\u2019m not interested in one liners or really any posts that don\u2019t require much thought so sorry if you\u2019re looking for that. My main platform is kik and that\u2019s all I use so apologies for that as well. If this sounds like something that interests you then feel free to shoot me a message thanks! (:",

Now that we've got that warning out of the way. I don't particularly have any preference as to who wants to roleplay, guy or girl. My discord ID is: Irene #5410. I respond a lot quicker then, but feel free to also message me on here too. I'll be checking regularly. Here are a few things I also want to add on:\n\n* You've gotta be literate! I normally write 1500+ words, but I'm flexible. 2 paragraphs minimum.\n* Original characters! I don't wanna see characters pulled directly from shows, video games, or anime.\n* We have to use Discord.\n* ***Also!!!*** I can do fandom-based roleplay too. Just message me with your particular fandom, I'll probably be into it. My interests are varied, lol.\n\n*A few plot ideas!* However you can also whip up a few and send them over to me, I love new and unique plots myself:\n\n\\#1: I don't know if it's a little overrated, but soulmates! Essentially, Muse A and Muse B are spiritually connected and are fated to meet. This can be done in several ways, whether it's a red string that connects them both, or if they may not see color until they meet the other muse. There are several kinds of ways to roleplay this particular scenario that I adore but haven't gotten around to. Muse A is probably a bit of a hot-headed person and is hard to get to. Muse B is very loving and has a heart of gold, but also gets their feelings hurt a little too easily.\n\n\\#2: An android and a human. This can go several ways. The android doesn't have any feelings, at least to the human's knowledge, and the human unknowingly makes the android slowly realize they're falling in love with the human. They're conflicted, and don't know what to do about the malfunctions in the programming that they have. The human is a kind-hearted person who accepts people, rather androids, for what they are. They most likely hired the android for an illness that had them bed-ridden for a short time. Eventually the android grew on them, and they kept the robot as it had grown on them.\n\n\\#3: Aaaand, for some reason I'm blanking out. Message me if you have some of your own though!!!",

            "selftext": " Hey folks! I found a number of RPs last time through here and that was awesome! I'm back again searching for a different genre this time. I'm a nonbinary person with a variety of characters of all genders looking for some sci-fi roleplay! I know sci-fi is a generic/broad genre so more specifically I'm interested in transhumanist/cyberpunk themed sci-fi, a la Altered Carbon, Eclipse Phase, etc. but am always open to adding in more elements from other sci-fi settings. I'm also a fan of LANCER (a sci-fi/mech setting), space exploration themes, and more.\n\nI have a couple of characters and ideas. One of my characters is an AI/hologram who spontaneously gained sapience (as far as he knows). He's basically a person missing a physical body, which can lead to optimal angst of course. Sure would suck if the person you wanted to be with physically didn't have a body! He's a hacker by trade (note: I am in no way knowledgeable in that field IRL, so no it's not going to be accurate, it's fiction, apologies in advance - I know some about computers and network security but am definitely not skilled enough to make it accurate lmao) and rents an \"office\" where people can meet his hologram projection if they really want, but really it just has a server room in the basement that houses all his stuff. I also have a character who was a child clone of a famous politician, raised as her daughter, who ran away when she discovered she was a clone, and now works as a mercenary. And am always up for creating more characters! Feel free to tell me about your own characters &amp; ideas when you message me!\n\nIdeally the RP would be story based but can definitely lead to NSFW elements, I just don't want that to be the only facet to the RP. I like long-term RP - to give you an idea, years ago my oldest RP partner and I exchanged like 28,000 emails of RP over the span of like 6 years. Not saying we have to stick around that long if you don't end up feeling it, but PWP doesn't generally get us that far :P\n\nA bit about me, I'm 27 years old, nonbinary, been roleplaying for about 16 years, and prefer 3rd person semi/literate. My intro posts/starters tend to get a little lengthy but 1-2 short paragraphs max is my average length for replies. I'm only seeking partners 18+ (preferably older just given my own age).\n\nFor platform, I prefer to RP on tumblr, but I also have Discord. I may not be totally opposed to other platforms if you had something specific in mind (not Kik/Skype though, I hope to never install Skype again lol - email, Google Docs, websites, etc. are all things I'm open to).",

By sorta, there will be many opportunities to write in a group, but you'll be matched with a main partner.\n\nYou've been given the opportunity to try a matchmaking service which claims to have 99.7% accuracy in partnering you with someone you're very compatible with.\n\nDepending on your character's circumstances, they have either paid a large sum to attend the service, been gifted it by a friend, won a competition or are being paid (a not insignificant but not life changing amount) to be a test subject.\n\nYou send me a description of your character (filling out the sheet I provide below). I will immediately match you with the character I think you'd be most compatible/have the most fun roleplaying with. You won't be informed of this for a week.\n\nFor around two weeks IRL (to allow time for responses) which will be one week in the roleplay, you and the other characters get to enjoy roleplaying and interacting in the grounds of the getaway (and outside of it, if you and another character decide to go for coffee or anything.) You might form bonds, enemies, friendships and romantic interests. All with the looming idea that once the week is up, you'll find out who you should be with in the group (if anyone.)\n\nOnce you're given your match, you then spend a month (not sure how long we'd make this irl) together within a shared apartment dealio to figure out how accurate the system was.\n\nI'll also be playing some side characters, so hey, maybe you end up being way more into that maid or that bartender or the matchmaker than you do the person you're supposed to be with.\n\nFrom there, drama might happen. Maybe you get your heart broken and maybe you break some hearts. Maybe you fall in love and maybe you end up despising the person you should have enjoyed being with. Should be fun, at least!\n\nIf interested, please let me know and fill out the form below. If I get enough interest, you should get an 'email' from the service letting you know your match has been found.\n\n**CHARACTER NAME:**\n\n**GENDER:**\n\n**ORIENTATION:**\n\n**APPEARANCE:**\n\n**PERSONALITY:**\n\n**HOW WOULD THEY DESCRIBE THEMSELVES?:**\n\n**HOW WOULD CLOSE FRIENDS/FAMILY DESCRIBE THEM?:**\n\n**HOW WOULD THEY DESCRIBE THEIR PERFECT MATCH IF ASKED?:**\n\n**BACKGROUND:**\n\n**HOW WOULD THEY END UP PARTICIPATING?**\n\n**WORST THING ABOUT THEM:**\n\n**BEST THING ABOUT THEM:**",

We should develop these more as we talk.\n\n1.) Royalty &amp; Bodyguard\n\nThere has been a betrayal, a kingdom has fallen and the royal family has been almost entirely slaughtered. By mere luck, only a piece of the royal family escaped, and with them, their bodyguard.\n\n2.) Red Riding Hood (esque)\n\nThere is a destination that must be reached, yet it lies through these perilous woods. It is said that a haunted person dwells eternally, some call it a ghost, others say it is a demon, but what is certain is that, from the many people who have come here before, many have disappeared.\n\n3.) Forbidden Magics\n\nA mage is sentenced to death for their practice of black magic, yet they never make it to the gallows. By orders of a noble, maybe even royalty, this mage has been bought out of their death sentence. In secrecy, they are sent to an estate where they are tasked with teaching a spoiled, power-hungry noble the secrets of black magic.\n\nPM me if you're down, and if you have a favorite idea be sure to tell me in your introduction.",

            "selftext": "Hello there!\n\nI'm looking for something specific here. I would love to find someone to start a long-term roleplay with. I'm just talking about a slice-of-life thing, nothing crazy or bizarre or out there. We can absolutely work out the details and develop the scenario together; are we a newly-married couple, moving into our first real house? Are we a couple in college who have been dating for a few months and we've just moved in together for the first time? Maybe we've been together for a few years, and we start with the night we decide we want to try for a child? Or maybe we just start from our first date and get to know each other for real, going through all those other firsts in their own time! I'm up for any one of these, or, if you have a different idea, just say so! We can work together to figure out what we like.\n\nAs for the tone, I'd love for this to be simple, domestic, and intimate. But to me, those softer, quieter moments of developing a relationship are the context that gives the relationship meaning. I want to discuss interests before we start! I do want to discuss the idea of cheating/affairs! But of course, we can definitely discuss this stuff before we start; I want to make sure this is just as enjoyable for you as it is for me.\n\nA few other technical notes: I play in first person present tense, so I hope that's okay. I'm also definitely looking for someone who is detailed and descriptive, preferably writing in between 1-3 paragraphs (though of course some responses require a lot of writing and some not so much, we can feel all that out, I'm not a stickler).\n\nIn short, I'm looking for a simple, sweet, intimate slice-of-life roleplay with someone who's looking for something similar; something regular and consistent where we can both unwind together and build the scenario together over time. If you're interested in that, let me know! Hope to hear from you soon :)",

I'm interested in a slow-burn roleplay these days, something that takes a while for our characters to come around to each other, perhaps not even liking one another for the beginning of the plot.\n\nI don't have many requirements for my partners. I'm free to roleplay fairly often and get quite invested in good ones. I just prefer that if you're not feeling it, you let me know so I can stop looking forward to responses. \n\nI prefer to write in first person but third works as well. When it comes to length of posts, I usually contribute 1-5 paragraphs. Maybe more if it's appropriate for whatever reason that might be.\n\nI roleplay anything from modern, historical, science fiction, and both low and high fantasy. I'm open to discussing any plots or ideas you have in mind but I'll provide a few to give you an idea of the types of storylines I like playing around with:\n\n* Farm Life - A successful farmer struggles to relate to his new love interest whose more progressive values go against his quiet lifestyle. \n\n* Crime Drama - This is a theme that can have several iterations but lately I've been thinking about playing a corrupt police officer of some kind against a more sympathetic partner. Maybe something like my character uses yours for information while simultaneously keeping her at her position in life for his own benefit.\n\n* No plot really for the last idea, but I was thinking of doing a roleplay where a husband and wife attempt to mend their marriage after an affair. Open to talking about this one if anyone is interested.\n\n\nI'm pretty versatile so be sure to message me if you're interested in working something out together. I'm free most of the time so hit me up whenever.",

You just look a little\u2026 anxious,\u201d she huffed at Shosh\u2019s heavy lidded, bloodshot eyes. \n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cOh God, don\u2019t worry about me. I\u2019m totally fine. *Please.* I just felt like moving around a little bit,\u201d Shosh explained very deliberately and slowly, taking deep, measured breaths as she looked around the lively party. It was full of people she didn\u2019t know, and for the first time in 5 years, she didn\u2019t have Bobby at her side, helping her through whatever crisis situation she had found herself in again. She was alone, and\u2026 \u201cActually, I don\u2019t know dude. Maybe I\u2019m not fine. Do I seem weird? Am I acting weird?

Pretty\u2026 pretty quick. Nobody minds, though! I just wanted to check on you.

I\u2019m just gonna stop walking and hang out. Right here, I guess,\u201d she tried her best to casually lean against the wall, a little ways away from several groups of people all situated around the large living space, talking and dancing, mixing drinks and picking at the spread that was set out along the kitchen island. \n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cI think that\u2019s a great idea. Just relax, maybe have another drink. Maybe eat some real food. That usually helps,\u201d Casey handed the drink back and dug a chapstick out of her pocket. \u201cHere,\u201d she handed it across to her friend who took it quickly and applied it to her lips. \u201cJust don\u2019t think too much about it. Everybody else ate one too, so we\u2019re all in the same boat. Nobody\u2019s looking at you, I promise.\u201d \n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cWhat?\u201d Shosh took a deep breath as a deep wrinkle formed between her brows.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure almost everyone here had a brownie, too. Did you eat a half or a whole?\u201d Casey took the chapstick back and looked around the party for her fiance, Matt. \n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cOh my god, Casey,\u201d she whined with genuine regret, feeling a knot form in her stomach. \u201cI ate like 4 of them,\u201d her voice almost cracked as she quietly, urgently whispered the admission to the blonde in front of her. She hurried to drink down what was left in her cup hoping the familiar sensation of drunkenness would overpower any competing feelings. \u201cThere was no note, no sign. You should have put a little sign next to the tray. Oh my god. They were bite size, I grabbed a handful,\u201d she elaborated on her misstep, her voice cracking as she willed herself not to cry. She was always a prude, and an over-reactor. But weren't *brownies* supposed to have the opposite effect, weren\u2019t they? What was happening. \u201cOh my god, am I\u2026 *overdosing?*\u201d \n&gt; \n&gt; A sudden explosion of sound erupted from the kitchen as several people burst out laughing all in chorus at a fallen dish that had shattered on the ground. \u201cCrap,\u201d Casey huffed before quickly turning her focus back onto her best friend. \u201cLook, you\u2019re not overdosing, that\u2019s hilarious. There\u2019s no such thing, Shosh. You\u2019re gonna be fine, just eat something, and keep drinking, and-\u201d she looked back to the kitchen as someone shouted across at her, asking where the broom and dustpan were. \u201cI gotta go clean that up, just; you\u2019re fine. I\u2019ll be right back,\u201d Casey looked to an approaching figure, a man returning from the bathroom with a drink in hand. She grabbed him and pulled him to her side. \u201cThis is Matt\u2019s friend. He\u2019s gonna wait here with you until I get back, ok? Because I\u2019m sure Matt understands exactly what you\u2019re going through,\u201d Casey assured Shoshanah once more before quickly turning up to Matt. \u201cShe ate a bunch of brownies, maybe for the first time in her life. Don\u2019t let her die,\u201d she huffed. \n&gt; \n&gt; \u201c*WHAT?*\u201d Shoshanah gasped in a quiet panic. \n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cJoking! Be right back,\u201d Casey huffed before pushing Matt\u2019s friend toward the shorter brunette and quickly slipping away to tend to the mess in the kitchen. \n&gt; \n&gt; Shoshanah looked up at the figure before her, who suddenly looked just as out of his depth as she felt. \u201cI don\u2019t usually do this. I\u2019m- I\u2019m a school teacher,\u201d she explained insistently, shamed and panicked. She looked up and down his costume before remembering that she too was dressed in one. \u201cI\u2019m Dorothy,\u201d her voice cracked and her lip quivered. \u201cFrom the Wizard of Oz. I had a Toto, but I can\u2019t find my purse,\u201d she nearly broke into tears, but bravely steeled herself and looked to the man before her for guidance. \n&gt; \n\nShoshanah Horvath just turned 30 years old. She teaches second grade at Herbert Hoover Elementary School. Her boyfriend of five years just broke up with her. And she's never done drugs in her life. Please send help. \n\nLooking for a mature writer who has moderate to high availability, a sense of humor, and an open mind. This is intended to be a light, romantic, funny, slice of life adventure. Hope to hear from you!",

            "selftext": "Hello!   I'm Doe and I'm looking for partners that are at least 21+ as that's  my  age range. I write multiple paragraphs/novella style (200-500+  words). I  love to write detailed descriptions and delve into a  character\u2019s  head/emotions as well as surroundings. I compare it to  writing a novel  together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI  understand if the scene  doesn\u2019t have alot going on and therefore  requires less. I adore having  long, thoughtful replies where we truly  immerse ourselves in the world.  I'm hoping to find a partner whose as  enthusiastic about the plot and  writing as I am. When I get invested in  a story, it\u2019s 100% dedication.  Getting a reply is the highlight of my  day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm   a big fan of romance and using face claims. I\u2019m the type to make   pinterest boards, spam you with gifs, headcanons, and send you songs   that remind me of our characters and/or ship.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast  but not least I only do MxF (with myself in the female role and you in  the male). I don\u2019t double, but I\u2019m more than happy to write side  characters of either gender to help move the story along.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd  highly prefer *female authors writing male characters* as I've had  too many bad encounters with male writers and at this point I'm  uncomfortable with it. Sorry guys!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDesperately Searching For:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\* 21+ partners\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*  For you to have an excellent grasp of grammar, punctuation, spelling,  and capitalization. Both in character and out of character.  (Literate to advanced writers only, please. I'm not looking for newbies  or those who English isn't their first language).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*  The  more description, the better! I'm looking for someone can write as  much  as me (2 to 4 paragraphs or more) and really bring the story to  life. I  lose interest if I'm the only one that's invested/enthusiastic  or  coming up with plot ideas. Quality writing makes my heart happy, as  does  world building together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*  The  use of real life face claims and joining me in the wonderful world  of  ship/character development isn't a requirement but I'd sure be  delighted  if we were on the same page in this regard. (I won't use  anime faces,  only art if you're uncomfortable with real life)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\* I'm looking for the long term here, and I hope you will be too. I've had stories going for months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf  you've made it this far, thank you! You won't be disappointed in  writing with me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOriginal Genres:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\* Mafia/Crime\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\* Post Apocalyptic/Dystopia\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\* Supernatural/Modern Fantasy\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\* Southern/Mid-Western/Urban Gothic\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\* Modern Mythology/Fairytale Retellings\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\* Sci-fi\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\* Cyberpunk/Retro-Futuristic\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\* Superpowers/Gifted\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll  my characters will be adults and I require my partners to do the same.  For plot and more genre ideas, please message me \\^\\^ I prefer to write  over email but use discord for chatting and writing, along with google  docs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease   be detailed when you message me, let me know why you chose to contact   me. Seeing \"hey do you wanna rp?\" is a guaranteed way to turn me off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLook forward to hearing from you!",

            "selftext": "Hey there!  \n\n\nRecently I've gotten sucked back into the Mad Max hype after re-watching Fury Road and reading through the latest DND Adventure \"Descent into Avernus\" and I'm a mess. I think setting up a personalized RP set within the general world of Mad Max would be a really cool premise!  \n\n\nGenerally, when basing RPs in already established worlds, I like to create a setting that isn't really connected to the canon at all except for a few places (like Gastown) or something. I do this not only because I lack an extensive knowledge of the Mad Max world but I also like my partner and I to brainstorm ideas to add to the RP in order to make it more personalized and unique to our tastes! I'm also just a huge fan of worldbuilding and going over different ideas with my partner.  \n\n\nAt the moment I don't have an exact plot in mind, but I am more than happy to hear any ideas you might have or brainstorm with each other to settle on an idea that we'd both like!  \n\n\nSome of the ideas that I want to include with the story so far are:   \n\n\n\\- Coming up with factions that our characters can freely interact with in whatever way we choose. Would we side with a specific faction and end up working for them? Will we try and work for all of them? Go to war with all of them? Ally with one and try to climb the social ladder until we eventually dethrone the current leader and create a power vacuum for us to fill? It's up to us!  \n\\- Upgrade-able equipment and vehicles that we can upgrade through our actions within the narrative  \n\\- I really like the idea of the \"base of operations\" mechanic in games that allow you a place to return to and upgrade to fit your personal tastes in unique ways. Will we try to help this little camp or will we simply neglect it an abandon it?    \n\\- And whatever else we wanna include!  \n\n\nWhat I look for in a partner:\n\nNaturally, I expect my partners to be 18+ not only because of the inherently gritty world Mad Max is based in, but also because I tend to like having a decent amount of NSFW elements and themes present within the RP as long as it doesn't become the main focus. I understand that's not everyone's cup of tea, and that's fine! I personally just like to include it  \nOther than that, I also would like people that are of a semi-lit or lit in terms of their writing. I hate saying it that way, but I personally writing about an average or 2-3 (sometimes more) paragraphs and it always sucks to be replied to with one-liners  \n\n\nSomeone who is patient for their partner to reply. I'm a college student and sometimes the workload makes it so that I won't be on some days as a result of the lack of motivation or sheer lack of time. I always try to reply as soon as I can, but there are some days where I might just go silent. Just try and be understanding that I may not be available 24/7 even though I would love to be!  \n\n\nSomeone who is willing to worldbuild and engage in conversation outside of the RP! I always love talking to my partners and getting a better understanding of what they want from the RP as well as what they might be interested in doing down the line with the story. Not only that, but I also l love getting to know the people I'm writing with! Sure, we may be writing about fictional characters in an entirely different fictional world, but that shouldn't mean we have to avoid talking with each other  \n\n\nThat's about it! If you're interested, feel free to shoot a PM my way. I'll respond as soon as I can!",

            "selftext": "Not so deep down I have a very soft spot for traditional fairy tales. The *drama, romance* and just plain whimsy of them is so much fun to me! So today I thought I\u2019d look for partners who were interested in roleplaying out one. However rather than just play the story straight, I want to throw a twist onto it. This could be anything; change of setting, change of time period, gender swapping, change of romantic interest, redeemable villain, supernatural elements\u2026 etc. \n\nI will admit I\u2019m drawing a lot of inspiration from Disney movies when it comes to fairy tales, but I am quite open to stories that stretch beyond that. So if this interests you **send me a PM with the fairy tale you\u2019d like to play, as well as the twist you want to put on it, and we\u2019ll discuss it!** Or if you have *multiple ideas* send those too and we can narrow it down! \n\nHere\u2019s some more info to give you a better idea of me and what I\u2019m looking for: \n\n**About Me**\n\nI\u2019m over 25, female, and very literate. I don\u2019t expect you to match me. I enjoy writing, and sometimes if I\u2019m really into a story I can get carried away and write a lot. Some people seem to get put off by this. I hate ghosting, so I will always do my best not to do that to you. I\u2019d appreciate if you weren\u2019t interested in the rp anymore that you just tell me so instead of disappearing. *I always play females*; I can play males if they\u2019re side characters, but not my main PC. I don\u2019t mind if you play a M or F character. I prefer to write in 3rd person past tense. I don\u2019t mind including NSFW rp into the story only so long as it isn\u2019t the main focus. Sometimes I get busy, and can only reply once a day or two days. I\u2019ll let you know if I\u2019m going to be away longer. I play over Discord or email. \n\n**About You** \n\nBe over 18. Write more than 1 line. Write dialogue, contribute to the plot, write feelings, express emotions. Be willing to commit to something long term. If you\u2019ve read this far and you\u2019re still interested, include in your message to me how long the longest RP you ever wrote in was. I don\u2019t mind if you like to chat OOC or not. Be patient. Tell me if you need to go away for a few days or can\u2019t reply for awhile for whatever reason. It\u2019s fine. Life comes first. Don\u2019t be a ghost though, because they suck. \n\n**So\u2026**\n\nIf you\u2019re still interested after reading all of that, send me a DM! Let me know what your ideas are or what you\u2019re generally drawn to if you don\u2019t have a specific idea.\n\nThanks! X \n\n**If this post is still up, I\u2019m still looking for partners.**",

Haha. That being said, I'm not going to roleplay with someone who only gives me about three lines or text for a response. I very often hit the 2000 character limit on Discord, so keep that in mind if you're looking for a reference on how much I write. I can cross the 2000 character limits, once, twice, even three times for a response depending on what I have to go off of. Yes, I understand that sometimes the characters are just talking so the responses won't be as long, but I would expect them to pick up length as we moved on to other scenes instead of staying at dialogue length.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNO TEXT TALK\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHope to talk to you soon! (And please leave your Discord tag in your message! It'll make it easy on me since I just can't hold good conversations on Reddit. XD) I'm in eastern time! If that matters. XD",

I have no idea. Before I get into the nitty gritty, allow me to say a bit about myself. I'm a 20-something male with plenty of writing experience, about 6ish years or so. I'm the kind of guy who (proudly) sprouts absurd and out there ideas, literally just on a whim or the slightest bit of inspiration. Seriously. Sometimes I can get a little crazy. My post length is anywhere between 1-3 paragraphs, but I came definitely get more out if I'm feeling inspired.  I'm also, for whom it might concern, in the central timezone of the United States. That being said, I have a horrid sleep schedule, so I'll usually be up pretty late into the night.\n\n\nWith that out of the way, let me say what I'm looking for. I am (unsurprisingly) looking for a female partner to nerd out with, 18+ of course, just in case we *do* go down a NSFW road at some point (It's welcome, but I'd like to not to be the focus of anything). **I will not, under any circumstances, write with someone under the age of 18**. I'm not comfortable with it, and I'm sorry if someone out there disagrees with this. Additionally, I'm looking for someone that I can call my friend. All proper and business is boring. I like to freak out with my writing partners. Come up with dumb plotlines or AUs. If you're looking for something strictly professional, I'm probably not your guy.\n\n\n\nFinally, we get down to what I'm *really* gonna be vague on. As you might've guessed by the title, I'm looking for something fantasy related. What specifically, you might ask? I have no clue. I'm a sucker for romance plots, with an epic adventure hanging above our characters' head. Be it slaying gods, or sealing away an ancient evil, I can't get enough of it. I love all sorts of different fantasy races, too. Elves? Oh yeah. Demons? Sure! Any kind of Yokai? *my god, that'll press my buttons in juuust the right way*. That being said, anyone that brings an idea with **Kitsune** as a major emphasis will make me *very* happy. Anyway. If you have any existing ideas, please, throw them at me! I love reading through plots n ideas. Want to create something new? We can chat for a bit, and see what we both like.\n\n\nI'm rambling now, aren't I? I think I've gone on for long enough. If I've caught your eye, please, shoot me a message, and I'll get to you ASAP. I get a lot of messages, so I'm sorry if I don't get to you right away. Some messages also slip through the cracks, or don't follow a certain obvious rule, so sorry on that regard as well. Just be sure to include your favorite color in your title, so I know you got down this far. I won't respond without it, because I don't enjoy it when people don't read my post. Like I said, I'm usually around into the late hours of the night, so you'll likely catch me. Thanks for reading!\n\n\n(Oh, by the way, don't send me a message only saying \"hey I think we can work something out\" or the like. Tell me about yourself, have some energy.

Aka, expect inconsistency and likely only writing on the weekends, though this is hardly a rule as much as a suggestion of expectation.)  \n\n\nHiya.\n\nAs that blurb above, my main interest is in someone who holds to the same aesthetic and technical detail as I myself do, whether that be in use of prose and grammar or more relating to the world and the nations within it. To clarify, I enjoy a particular amount of detail when it comes to a universe: with the strong distaste I have for dry as marrow 'Dungeons and Dragons' worlds, I much rather prefer that the worlds be living and breathing things with the nations caked in history and culture and vibrant personalities that exist to give it blood and feel like an actual civilization that could exist realistically. They aren't just their self-contained little identities either: each identity and society would have evolved together and thus have drastically influenced each other's development, developing hatreds and sibling-like bonds between each other where, regardless of which, the necessity of (not exactly) state takes priority and ultimately all are looking out for themselves. Preferably, this would all take place within the scope of medieval favormongering politics: eight-hundreds to, at most, the fifteenth century in terms of technology. To be clear - I don't do AUs. Don't present me with your alternate history worlds that are edits to our own reality. I only do fantasy worlds, no alternative Earth material.\n\nFantastical races and supernatural/magical elements are a-okay with me as far as I'm concerned as, in my opinion, they give a chance for the world to put a spin on more conventional and realistic cultures and methods of administration by introducing non-human psychologies and biologies, making something alien and foreign for the MC to interact with (as well as other nations present.) This is, theoretically, including Tolkien-esq races such as dwarves, elves, orcs, all that, but, forewarning, that I have little to no respect for people who essentially just rebrand Tolkien's themes and ideas for races and paste them into their own, disrespecting him by so poorly conveying his meaning, and themselves for being a lighthearted plagiarist.\n\nQuite alright with the nitty and gritty. I dig a morbid universe that's dark and dreary and depressing as that essentially is the entire existence of the vast majority of the human population up until the industrial revolution which is a distance concept from now.\n\nWhere we write is of little consequence to me, but I do have a fondness for OC chatter on Discord, but it's not a requirement whatsoever. I personally discourage writing on Discord for the very obvious reasons of a text limit and it generally just being clunky with its formatting, but will acquiesce if requested.\n\nI play a number of OCs, many of which aren't women and all with their own diverse interests and opinions on things: bear in mind that I will choose a character that molds and fits into the world, not the other way around. I highly suggest not opening me with the question, 'Tell me about your character' before I know anything about the world and the content within it. I won't know until you share about yourself and the stories you're good at weaving and what the world you have to offer will, itself, have to offer.\n\nThat's about the length of it. Cheers, darlings.",

            "selftext": "Yeah yeah yeah.. Undertale was made in 2015 and not many people are into the fandom because of the toxicity and so I left the fandom for a while which was like, two years. Now I was watching some old videos of Undertale for the Nostalgia and I got back into it. Wow.\n\nSo now I want to do an Undertale Roleplay. I know pretty much everything about Undertale it is an amazing game and now let's get into the requirements..! \n\nYou have to at least be Semi-lit, Please do not use asterisks, and please use quotations whenever you're character is talking. Some little errors or mistakes are fine! I do not care what your age is, as long as you meet (some of) my requirements I do not care how old you are.\n\nYou do not have to be available 24/7 my only issue is that if you don't respond in like a month or so I will leave. Unless you have a reason.\n\nI do not do 18+ roleplays, I won't do it because this is Undertale. I don't like smut with this fandom. Sure, lewd things are fine here and there but you cannot cross the line. \n\nAs for characters I can do mostly everyone from Undertale, so if you have a specific character in mind you want to be, sure go ahead! I also like ship roleplay's so that's fine also!\n\nAs for social media platforms, I have Google hangouts or we can do it here on Reddit. But if you would want me to get Kik or Discord I can. I just don't have the app, I deleted it for storage reasons but I can download it again if needed.\n\nPM me if you're interested, thank you for reading and have a good day!",

I\u2019ve made a few posts before but I\u2019m still trying to wrap my head around reddit and this community lol. \n\nWhat I\u2019m looking for is someone who likes to do slice of life/modern romance with dark themes wether that be drugs, violence, mental health, etc. I like to have detailed story lines that I work on with my partner to create throughout the entire rp- coming up with twists and drama together in ooc to always be adding something to our rp. \n\nI\u2019m 18 and will only roleplay with people 18+ as I simply don\u2019t feel comfortable with anyone younger, sorry! I like to include nsfw themes and can discuss this further through pm though if that\u2019s what you\u2019re interested in. \n\nWhat I\u2019m looking for: \n\nYou\u2019re able to brain storm and come up with ideas with me (for 6 years I\u2019ve had one partner and it\u2019s always fallen to me to come up with ideas and I\u2019m tired off being the only one lol) \n\nYou\u2019re able to play a main character as well as others that we can incorporate. (I\u2019m always okay to share the role of extra characters) \n\nYou\u2019re able to write more than just a couple of sentences. I\u2019m not expecting a novel but I do like a few paragraphs. \n\nI like the write in 1st and 3rd person. Mixing them together lol. You don\u2019t have to do this but I will be so I hope that won\u2019t be a problem. ^^ \n\nIf anyone is interested please pm me with some ideas we could bounce around together.",

            "selftext": "The year is 1723, two of the largest samurai clans are stuck in a stalemate in a ruthless war for territory. The land is in complete turmoil, just living normally is dangerous, spies and assassins are everywhere and raids are almost inevitable. Your character is the Emperor/Epress of one of the fighting clans while Yashiro is a samurai that has just entered the capital city asking for a job in guarding the Emperor/Empress. \n\nNot much is known about him, he is quite mysterious although he seems somewhat skilled at first sight. How will the relationship between your character and Yashiro go? Will it be a rivalry? Will it be friendly or even romantic? It\u2019s all up to you...\n\nBasically, I\u2019m looking for an RP set in an alternate universe where there is a large war between clans. My character has shown up to defend yours, and their relationship is up to you. I\u2019d prefer for my partner to be at least semi-lit, reply a good amount per day, reply length isn\u2019t that much to me but I\u2019d like you to have a minimum of 2 lines. Novel-size replies are a no-no for me, I believe that it just starts to get a bit waffly. My ideal rely size is a small to medium size paragraph. I\u2019d also like you to be over 18 since not only do I like to go into smut but also there\u2019s going to be combat in this. Thanks a lot for reading, PM me for any questions answered and my discord details!",

            "selftext": "I am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+\n\nI am looking for a rp partner. I'm open to many different styles whether it be fantasy, or realistic. I have a few ideas in mind but would love to discuss potential ideas. As always come with some ideas and we can get something going.\n\nYour suggestion or ideas: If you have any changes to a particular scenario please share I'm open to suggestions. If you have a totally different idea or ideas please share aswell I'd love to hear.\n\nBusiness as usual: You're the CEO of a company in my town. I'm the president of the local motorcycle club and you come to me with a proposal. If i help you thin out the competition you'll help me with whatever i need.\n\nUnusual partners: You're an agent of the FBI and one day you get an assignment to capture a known criminal that no one can capture. You start trying to think of who can help you and you decide on me. I'm a retired car thief that's been in hiding ever since you almost took me down.\n\nZombie apocalypse: Don't have a scene for this but would love to create one together. \n\nDragon rider: You come from long line of dragon hunters. One day while on a hunting trip your father and his men a storm knocks you off the ship and into the ocean. You awake in a mysterious land inhabited entirely by dragons. While exploring the new place you stumble upon my cabin.\n\nBartender: I walked in on my girlfriend and bestfriend together in bed. We'd been dating for 5 years so this was a major blow. I leave and immediately go straight to the bar to drown out my sorrows. I sit at the bar and see you asking you for a drink.\n\nBig party small town: So the basic idea for my rp is your from the city and while passing through a small town in Tennessee you and the boy with you (could be son or little brother no preference.) You stop at the local store and see me and a few people putting flyers up for the annual \"redneck rave.\" You ask what it is and after i explain it your son or brother begs you to go and we pick up from there.\n\nSocial media: We're both big on social media from different aspects. One of us invites the other onto their podcast and we talk eventually getting to know each other and become friends and maybe more.\n\nYoutuber house: You're the owner and CEO of an esports team. You've had a team house for a abour a year and are ready to expand. You decide to have a content house you do your research and invite me to join and be the first streamer/content creator to live in the house with you. Eventually you'll invite others to join.\n\nWhere you come from: We grew up in the same small town in Georgia and were best friends. You moved to California when your dad got an amazing job and you've been living the wealthy life ever since. One day when you come home from shopping with your other rich friends your mom and dad tell you're all going back to Georgia for an extended visit and you couldn't be more upset. \n\nThe new guy: I wasn't the most popular guy at my old school and everyone picked on me. I embarrassed myself one day to the point of needing to get out. After meeting a guy that went through the same situation i reinvented myself as a cool jock type and transferred to your school. \n\nCriminal enterprise: Your mom and my mom were bestfriends. She helped pay for you mom's medicine when she was sick. When your mom finally passed you came to live with us. When you get here you realize we're one of the country's most successful crime families. \n\nSingle parent: This is one is pretty straight forward. We can discuss different options in PM.\n\nUnexpected pregnancy: We met at a party and got drunk and hooked up. We didn't talk afterwards until you called me telling me your pregnant. \n\nSmall town living: you were always a good respectable person. You always saw the good in people but sometimes that wasn't necessarily a good thing. You dated a guy that seemed fine to everyone except behind closed doors he was extremely abusive. When you came home one day with a broken nose and a black eye your parents knew they needed to do something. They decided to send you to live with your aunt to hopefully hide you from him.\u00a0 You were relieved to be away from hom finally. When you get to your aunt's farm you see me working out in the fields. \n\nSuperpower: Ever since i was 5 i knew i was different but no one ever told me why. I came from a long line of shapeshifters unfortunately that's usually what got them killed. Both my dad and uncle were shifters but they mysteriously died when i was 5. My mother started to see the signs of me becoming one the animal print started to show on my body and she knew she couldn't go through with it. When i was 6 she turned me over to foster care and disappeared. Now I'm 22 and using my gift for more personal gain. Rather it be changing into a horse betting on myself at the local track or a championship caliber race dog. You've been passed a file on me to try and bring me in to try and stop a criminal mastermind from trying the world into chaos. \n\nReconnect: I've been bestfriends with your older brother since we were in kindergarten. We're both sophomores in college and play football for the school. You and me always had a connection but never acted on it. Now it's your brother's wedding and we meet up when you see my smoking out by my truck.",

I roleplay on discord only, Reddit messages are just inconvenient. I'm fine roleplaying with males and females I only do 1x1 roleplays though. I'm a semi-literate to literate roleplayer, I like the details that can make it easier to imagine the setting and scene. I play mostly as female roles since that's what I'm good at, I also write in the third person. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor genres, I like romance, action, drama, fantasy, adventure, mythology, sci-fi, slice of life. I would love to try horror, mystery, thriller. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm okay with fandom roleplays but I normally like the idea to be just set in the world of the fandom. Mostly because I don't wanna act out of character. But keep in mind I might not know/like a certain fandom. I won't be rude about it as long as you understand that and don't blow up on me. Currently, I would only accept one or two fandoms roleplays since I already have a few going on. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut fandoms I'm apart of is Diabolik Lovers, Subnautica, Starbound, Rimworld, Fallout (the game series), Skyrim, My Time At Portia, Amnesia (the anime), most studio ghibli movies, Fable (the game series),  Stardew Valley. Just to name a few so you get an idea about stuff that I'm interested in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyhow, I would love to hear from you! Message me if you believe we would make suitable partners. Please send me 123 if you read this far down. This is just my way of weeding out people who automatically send a message before reading or skimming the post. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHave a good day!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.s. If you are looking for pure smut than please understand I'm not doing that. I'm not against it if it comes naturally in a story but I won't do a roleplay based around smut. Also, I have a few ideas for plots if you wanna ask me about them.",

            "selftext": "Just looking for someone who has similar tastes as me when it comes to RP. I\u2019m wanting something long-term. Not looking for a GM, and I\u2019m not a GM, more something we brainstorm together and just have fun doing. I like thinking up a fun story we can both get into, and building a good character (and NPCs, etcetera.) to go with it. \n\nPlease be 18+, as I\u2019m an adult.\n\nI only write in third person. I write multiple paragraphs. Usually averaging 2-4 but honestly it varies on what\u2019s going on, I can do more. I think good spelling and grammar is awesome. Although, let\u2019s face it, mistakes definitely happen! I just want to understand things well, and have fun. I\u2019m pretty descriptive and love getting immersed in the story. \n\nI\u2019m not new to RP, kinda new to Reddit, sorta new to Discord. But I\u2019ve been RPing for about seven years or so. In my experience it would be best to have a partner who is patient. I can do a back and forth mostly during weekdays, during the day. I\u2019m usually not up all night. (EST.) But sometimes it varies. I\u2019ll reply when I can. \n\nMy strongest suite is high fantasy/medieval genre. I\u2019m open to low fantasy/medieval, and post apocalyptic as well in a slice of life setting. Weaker points would be Sci-Fi and things like that. I do enjoy romance if the chemistry is right. World building is okay, to a degree, as long as it isn\u2019t overly complicated. Lol And I don\u2019t really do fandoms, but I could try? I\u2019m not into a lot of that stuff, so it\u2019s kinda hard for me when I\u2019m so unfamiliar, I guess. \n\nFeel free to message me. We\u2019ll see how it goes and move on from there.

Why not join in on the fun?\n\n**Why join?**: There are a few SCP roleplays out there, heck GMOD even has a few. We like to pride ourselves in being different as many other roleplays focus on facility roleplay. We broaden our horizons to all aspects of the SCP universe. Want to be an intelligence agent out in the field? Perhaps an undiscovered SCP in hiding. Want to be a part of another group such as the Chaos insurgency, then that is totally doable. Facility roleplay is also acceptable as well but feel free to experiment with different ideas. \n\n**Where do I join?**: We have a [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SCP_Roleplay/) and [discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/DHPQ5ut) you can check out! \n\nAnd don\u2019t forget \\[DATA EXPUNGED\\]!",

But we can totally talk about it! I will do fxf or fxm\n\nI just want fluff upon fluff opon fluff. Waking up to your partner cooking breakfast and yoi wrap your arms around them from behind. Literally anything that is simple!\n\nOne of my favorite rps startes with our chatacters in high school and ended with their children in high school.\n\nI will do 1st or 3rd person, and write about 1-2 paragraphs. \n\nAlso please be between 18-27 because other than that I get weirded out.\n\nI am not looking to become friends, send photos, or anything. THIS IS PURELY ROLEPLAY.\n\nAlso I WILL ONLY RP ON HERE (REDDIT)\n\nThank you!",

PM me for my discord, and I'll send you screenshots of my current rp I'm legitmately dying to do. It doesn't have to be done exactly as since I'm wanting a different reason of blackmail for each rp.\n\nIt'd be somewhere along the line of my character doing something and your character getting revenge or something of the sort.

I know what I like and I hope to find it in who ever responds to this post. This post will remain until I find who I feel fits the status.\n\nI am a sucker for fluff, and real life. This is why I'm looking to build a world with some one based around two individuals who just happen to fall in love. Their story can be based on anything really but the concept will remain the same. It will be based on the small moments of their life and the huge ones. From the first date, to their engagement.\n\nWhat I'm Looking For\n\n* Must be literate,18+ for NSFW purposes,and available once or twice out of the day.\n* I am willing to play with both Female or Male. Either is fine. I'm also willing to play Male if your character is female.\n* I like detailed responses. I normally type up a paragraph or more. I would like the same in return.\n* Must write in third person, If you really push for first person maybe I will bend but it will likely be third person.\n* This is a ROMANCE based role play with added drama and daily struggles. Nothing less, nothing more.\n\nPM me if interested.",

            "selftext": "This is pretty much me not knowing what I want to write but itching to write something. I'm looking for literate partners who write 2+ paragraphs (I get sometimes you just want to write a line of dialogue to keep things moving, that's cool.)\n\nSend me a number between 1 and 36. This decides the basic outline of the plot, based on The Thirty-Six Dramatic Situations. I will have randomised the list so there's no way for you to decide which situation you want, but I thought I'd let you know where I'm getting the list from.\n\nI'll tell you which situation we got. Then, send me either a genre or a song. With the genre or mood/lyrics of the song in mind, we'll each come up with up to 5 ideas for a plot. We'll decide which one we want to go for.\n\nAs for characters, you can come up with your own or we can randomly generate. If we randomly generate, I suggest we take this site (http://writingexercises.co.uk/random-character-traits-generator.php) and give each other two numbers between 1-10. The traits you get on the generator for each number determines the traits of each other's characters.\n\nI'd suggest leaving backstory and appearance up to us but I'm also happy to randomly generate those too.\n\nIf you're interested, please let me know! Hope to hear from you!",

I\u2019m a bit out of practice but I would consider myself a detailed writer, I usually get 1-3 paragraphs depending on the responses I get. My genres are definitely fantasy/supernatural, medieval, and romance. I\u2019m not a huge fan of happiness and fluff though, I really enjoy torturing my characters first. Anything \u201cforbidden\u201d is a plus. As far as 21+, I\u2019m not hugely into smut, but I\u2019d rather be writing with those in my age group. \n\nSo anyway, if that didn\u2019t bore you to death and you\u2019re interested at all please let me know!!

The Kingdom of Vediston prepared for this threat by locking down the kingdom, telling the people that they were at war with a neighboring kingdom, and keeping them from the truth. After that, the Coterie initiative was enacted. This program pulled forgotten children from the streets of Vediston and turned them into highly skilled pairs of warriors over the span of many years. The mission of these Sentinels is simple. The unconditional defense of the kingdom, and to ensure the public remains in the dark about the situation. \n\u256c\u256c\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u256c\u256c\n\u0f3b What do we have to offer? \u0f3a\n\n\u2727 A friendly and welcoming environment for all to enjoy.\n\u2727 A well developed lore with an amazing setting to roleplay in\n\u2727 A variety of self roles to choose from \n\u2727 A wide selection of bots for the community to enjoy\n\u2727 A staff team that is dedicated to making the experience as amazing as possible for the community \n\n\u256c\u256c\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u256c\u256c\nWe hope that you decide to come to check us out.

Specifically Studio Ghibli\u2019s works.\n\nI have a couple ideas for plot.\n\n1. I\u2019m a writer who\u2019s moved into an abandoned house in the forest. There, I find you, an animal-girl maid, spiritually tied to the house. Together we have fun adventures and a romance blossoms.\n\n2. I\u2019m an apprentice in magic, reasonably clever but lacking a tutor. I set out on a pilgrimage looking for a teacher. Soon I find a Witch\u2019s cottage in the forest, I knock on the door and you reluctantly accept me as your student.\n\n3. In this one, I\u2019m an adventurer while you play roughly 2-3 characters who accompany me on my journey. We must find an ingredient for a high magician, but the object is in a far off land. The girls begin to slowly love me, but of course I can only choose one.\n\nThat\u2019s it, I have a couple details more I\u2019d like to discuss in PM but nothing major.\n\nI\u2019m in BST (British) time zone so it would help if you live in Europe and are moderately free. We can arrange schedules.\n\nThat\u2019s it for now, DM me and we can exchange Discord\u2019s.\n\nBye!",

Sure, it was a cartoon series in the '80s. However, the 2002 series set up the potential for a serious world that on the level of Lord of the Rings. Furthermore, the movie was a bit cheesy. \n\nI love bad guys (lol). I am interested in role-playing/writing a story focusing on Skeletor &amp; Evil-Lyn. Yet, it's a bit of re-imagination with Evil-Lyn and a bit of storytelling that departs from \"canon\" or anything from the He-Man and the MOTU mythos. However, I'd love to have a story that has them as this power couple, well after Keldor becomes Skeletor. In other words, a romance tale. Set when they're established behind Snake Mountain. \n\nMy Evil-Lyn is a bit re-imagined and I think she would be a nice departure from how she has been depicted in other mediums. I think we can brainstorm a costume design for her too. Yet, I wanted to show you what I'm imagining here.\n\nI\u2019m trying to see if I can head somewhere to a place someone would be willing to help me with this.",

I don\u2019t remember much of the book other than that this woman named Veronika chose to take her own life. She wasn\u2019t exactly in excruciating emotional pain, but more just empty and saw no point in continuing her meaningless life. She wakes up in a mental hospital and is told she has only a few days left. In that mental hospital Veronika finds herself and her will to live again as she gets to know other inpatients and even falls in love with one. That in a nutshell, don\u2019t shoot me if I got it wrong. \n\n  \n Anyway, I am not looking to copy the whole plot. What\u2019s important is the theme. A person who finds his life so empty he is ready to end it finds another broken human being who struggles with his own mental health issues. Although the plot is rather dark, I\u2019m not looking for just angst. I actually find it to be full of hope as even in the book it is revealed in the end that Veronika was not going to die and the doctor lied to shock her into appreciating what she had. I also enjoy dark humor and I appreciate that in a partner too. We can change the setting btw, it doesn\u2019t have to be a mental hospital. They could meet through mutual friends, at work, in a bar\u2026 basically anywhere as long as we kept the basic idea. \n\n  \n I am fine with writing either character as long as they\u2019re both well developed and realistic. I won\u2019t write with anyone under the age of 21, sorry! Also, I am only looking for a mxm romance right now.",

            "selftext": "This RP is a unique world in which to the south of the main continent lies a treacherous wasteland filled with unnatural and disfigured creatures called the Blackened Lands. No one has found the end of it so many have assumed it to be an endless wasteland of mountains and monsters. Some believe otherwise. The main storyline will be the group attempting to cross the Blasted Lands to find what they believe is on the other side. I don't want to reveal much more as it is not fully fleshed out yet and I believe it would be fun to make the world together. The world is medieval in technology, so bows, swords, shields and such. There is also magic. Magic can be anything you want it to be within the realms of reason so no time travel, no mind reading, and no incredibly overpowered spells that just obliterate everything. Keep it balanced.  \n\n\nI expect this RP to be an adventure/comedy. The storyline will follow the characters as they travel to the blackened lands and then into it. I expect the journey to take a while and there will be plenty of side-quests along the way so don't worry about getting into the thick of it at the very beginning.   \n\n\nThe RP will be on discord (Link below). I'm in US mountain time and I'm generally available from 4 pm. to 11 pm. If not then I will inform you ahead of time. The lore is still fairly liquid so if you have any suggestions let me know.   \n\n\n[https://discord.gg/kb7BePD](https://discord.gg/kb7BePD)",

You know what roleplayers hate but everybody loves around Halloween? Ghosts! So, in spirit of all my ghosts, vampires and all undead, let's revive some dead Roleplays of yours! Sound good? Yeah, I think so too! Here's my list of ideas, interests, limits and so on!\n\nIdeas/Interests:\n- Marvel (OCs)\n- Watchmen, maybe an AU of some kind? (OCxOC or, if you're comfortable, Rorschach (Me)xOC, which I'd prefer!)\n- Fantasy\n- Horror (More as a side thing unless your horror plot is really interesting!)\n- Action (Same as horror)\n- Sci-fi\n\nLimits:\n- I'm fine with underaged characters, but the lowest age I'll go is 14, unless they're a side character (your character's kid, sibling, friend's cousin, you get the gist)\n- No NSFW! I'm not really a big fan of smut/NSFW in Roleplays, sorry if that turns you off (no pun intended) from Roleplaying with me!\n- Not a big fan of furries. This is pretty self explanatory. I don't have any prejudice, in fact I can proudly state two of my close friends are furries, but doing furry RP personally makes me uncomfortable.\n- Repetitive characters aren't fun! Don't do em! When it comes to me, my characters are a slot machine. Male, Female, Transgender, Gender Neutral, etcetera. I don't want you to always make girls every time we do anything with new characters! Same goes for sexuality with my Characters, which brings me to my next thing..\n- Romance is never guaranteed! I like making my characters as their own seperate entity from yours, and therefore am not going to explicitly make them to be a cute couple with ya! If you ask me, I'll always tell you what sexuality my character is (Gay, Straight, Pansexual, Bisexual, etcetera), but even then gender isn't everything. I want things to happen naturally, and not primarily focus on romance! If you wanna be a guy and know my character is lesbian, that's entirely fine with me! If you want to be a girl and try for romance, that's also fine! Just don't have your character fall in love with mine five minutes after they meet, because I certainly won't do that with mine!\n\nOkay, I think that's about it! So, people of Reddit, show me the skeletons in your closet so to speak. Dig up those old roleplays of yours and lets see if we can't raise the dead together, yeah?",

            "selftext": "Hello! I go by Jam, and I\u2019m a longtime RPer that\u2019s still looking for another like-minded creative individual. Over the years I\u2019ve had the pleasure of writing with a plethora of people, in just about every genre imaginable. I\u2019ve cultivated friendships with them outside of writing that\u2019s led to some of the best RP\u2019s that have spanned years. So, when I look for a partner, I\u2019m looking for someone who wants something long-term, enjoys world building, character development, and story development through the RP itself. Hopefully you share those same values.\n\nI\u2019m primarily a novella style poster (Three paragraphs or more), but I also take into account what\u2019s going on in the story, as well as my partner\u2019s style. Quantity is certainly not everything. I do my best to make sure spelling, punctuation, and grammar are absolutely basic (What good is RP if you can\u2019t understand what I\u2019m typing?), so you should as well. I admit though, I have a love/hate relationship with commas. I also prefer google docs. I\u2019m open to Discord, but it\u2019s not really work friendly for me. We can talk about this.\n\nAs the title suggests, I\u2019m looking for RP set in one of the genres mentioned below (I'm open to your ideas as well). Original characters preferred. From there we can begin plotting things like world building, characters, character histories, background, and storytelling. Honestly, I can't state enough that this process is a favorite for me. I want to share the story, not run it. You shouldn\u2019t want to do so either. The flow should be automatic and the equilibrium between push/pull of events by writers should be balanced. I\u2019m an adult (Please be 21+), so please expect mature themes. \n\nAeon Trinity - Cyberpunk to the fullest. Science Fiction with a taste of realism. I have a site made with information to get new writers started.\n\nFallout - It\u2019s Fallout, not much more needs to be said.\n\nStar Wars - It\u2019s Star Wars, not much more needs to be said.\n\nMedieval Fantasy/High Fantasy - Might require a bit of world building, but I have some of that info from past writings if we choose to use it.\n\nModern Gods (Greek) - Something I've been interested in, but never really written.\n\nModern Fantasy - The 5th Age in Tolkien lore? Yes please. Think of the movie Bright on Netflix.\n\nModern Horror - World of Darkness. Vampires, wolves, fae, witches, and more. Oh my.\n\nWW2 - I'm not a history buff, but there's so much writing potential in this era as well.\n\nThis is just a bit of what's on my mind to write. Again, if you have any suggestions, I'll be open to them. So if you made it this far, thanks for reading. Shoot me a line if interested!",

            "selftext": "Hey there, r/roleplay!  I'm hoping to make a few new RP partners to entertain some ideas I have for original and pre-existing settings alike.\n\n**INTRO:** A little bit about me, I go by rat and I've been writing for 12+ years, give or take.  I'm an avid writer/roleplayer, and I have a menagerie of pets (a tegu, crested gecko, ball python, and a very handsome dog).  I currently work Mon-Fri 7AM-3PM PST, so I'm left with a lot of free time in the evenings, and the nature of my work lets me be on my phone pretty often.  I love writing and role playing, and I'm currently wasting my free time with WoW and talking to friends about dumb story ideas.\n\nI have a lot of experience with being a storyteller, and while I'm happy to fill that role, sharing it or having my partner take care of that would also be wonderful.  As for characters I have a plethora of them, and I love designing new ones just as much as I love designing original settings.\n\nThread has been tagged as NSFW just because I'm open to those themes and elements.  I love romance, and I'm okay with writing some salacious scenes, but I don't want either of those to be the main focus of the story, if that's okay with you.\n\n**PREFERENCES:** I prefer playing female characters, and for romantic elements I enjoy FxF and MxF.  I'm okay with writing male characters, and I have written gay male characters but I'm out of my element with them, so if you're interested in MxM you'll have to be patient as I work my way back into that.\n\nI love the Star Wars setting and stories like your typical Dungeons and Dragons campaign (sans dice and character sheets, unless that's really your thing).  Fallout has been a recent itch of mine, and I also like some anime settings like Naruto and My Hero Academia.\n\n**My main itches right now involve Elder Scrolls, Star Wars, and Original Fantasy.  I have a character I'd like to play for all of these settings.**\n\n**STAR WARS:** I'm a huge fan of anything involving Stormtroopers and their appropriate eras.  I love playing smugglers and other criminal-types, or more just the folks who are down on their luck and willing to do whatever it takes to survive in a galaxy constantly dealing with problems.  I would love to find someone willing to run a story for a character of mine in this setting, she's a runaway Jedi Padawan trying to survive during the Rise of the Empire era, mingling with smugglers and other criminal types to just try and get by.\n\n**FALLOUT:** Lately I've been playing Fallout 4 on and off to pass the time.  I have a Synth character I would like to play, who is trying to live in the ruined Commonwealth, or elsewhere if we would like (who's to say she couldn't have traveled?)\n\n**FANTASY:** D&amp;D, Elder Scrolls, LotR, Dragon Age, Warcraft, Witcher, anything fantasy really falls under this (and of course original settings, too).  I have two characters in mind and I'd be happy to double up depending on the needs of the story.  One is a disgraced knight, male, and the other is a fresh spellcasting adventurer, female.\n\n**WESTERN:** Inspired by Red Dead Redemption, I've been hankering to practice my southern drawl just in text form.  I have one character in mind for a potential western tale, but I'd really like to know what you're interested in, too!\n\n**CONTACT:** Feel free to write me a DM here, and share with me your interests and such.  For a speedier response, leave me your Discord username in the DM and I'll add you so we can chat.  I'll get back to you as soon as I can!\n\n*P.S.  Please don't send me a one-liner or just your Discord username.  Try to write at least something to help you stand out or show what your interests are.  Thanks!*",

I like to try and really paint a picture of what is happening.\n\nI have a basic foundation worked out in my mind, but I'm leaving it pretty open so that way my partner doesn't feel like they've been painted into a corner. This could just as easily be an \"equal partners\" situation as it could be a GM/player setup.\n\nDishonored and Skyrim are two of my favorite worlds, and each one offers different avenues of exploration. I'm also pretty flexible when it comes to formatting. We can RP here on Reddit, on Discord, or email/Google docs. Whatever my partner is comfortable with, I'll try my best to accommodate.\n\nHoping to get some orange envelopes!",
