They\u2019re usually just a paragraph as a normal response, but if I\u2019m really into the roleplay, I can write up to two or three. I expect my partners to return the same length or at the very least, have enough to keep the roleplay going. I respond within at least 24 hours and at least one reply per day would be sufficient enough.\n\nAs for genres, I\u2019m mainly into romance, slice of life stories. I\u2019m a cliche person, so if you have any cliche plots, I\u2019d be more than happy to hear them! I also enjoy fantasy and drama, as long as romance is in there.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to roleplay, don\u2019t hesitate to chat with me! My DMs are always open :)",

            "selftext": "The Fantasy Sandbox is a collaborative, medieval-fantasy story writing and world-building game in which all players have an equal input to the story and its effectively crowdsourced setting. This creates a unique, community-designed but cohesive roleplaying world and experience that allows a vast number of different fantasy themes in one place. You can play as any character or race--a king, a knight, an adventurer, a petty criminal, a mastermind villain, a commoner, a wizard or mage, a dragon, a fairy, you name it, provided they are presented in a medieval fantasy theme. Every character has a unique role and contribution to the game. In this freeform roleplaying setup, players create all the civilizations, stories, characters, and world geography within a casual rule set that maintains balance. As a result, interwoven stories emerge. The game world depends on that very emergence and has been developing its identity from a completely blank slate over the course of two years.\n\nThere's no telling who of the many currently active characters you'll meet or where you'll go. Player-designed factions have formed kingdoms, player-written quests drive entire adventures, and politics shape the land.\n\nThis has always been an open community game. If you like to roleplay in medieval-fantasy themes, we invite you to join us in helping maintain our novel continuum alive with new characters, plots, and settings!\n\n[***http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/5/introduction***](http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/5/introduction)  \n[***https://discord.gg/cb5n63C***](https://discord.gg/cb5n63C)",

Sometimes, the hero is a strong warrior, other times, they're a nigh-helpless hobbit. Still, at the end of the day, it's a fantasy world - an escape from reality. I've done RPs in the past where two unsuspecting strangers are brought into a fantasy world beyond their control and have to work through the trials and tribulations associated with it. I've also played it out where the two know each other, along with various incarnations of such an idea.\n\nWhat I'm Looking For:\n\n\\- Long Term\n\n\\- Good writing/grammar\n\n\\- Someone willing to work with me on plotting and characters\n\n\\- At least one post a day \n\nI'm hoping to incorporate romance elements and, if you're okay with it, us having a few party members at our control as well. We can make this as in-depth or shallow (not in a bad way) as we want, in terms of mechanics. I'm willing to do adult content and have a few ideas revolving around that concept, but it's ultimately down to what we decide together. \n\nI try to be courteous and punctual with my responses. Also, if there is anything you end up not liking about the RP or the way it is going, let me know and we can work it out! Hopefully this catches one or two of your attentions.

Maybe a maximum would be in a week\u2019s time.\n\nWith that being said, I will not be able to make everyone happy, especially since there is an influx of people who wish for me to RP with them. I will be choosing those I see best fit with my interests and availability, and I apologize beforehand if I don\u2019t choose to RP with you (I will send you a message back telling you I can\u2019t and will not ghost you. Maybe we can continue talking as friends and get to know each other.)\n\nAgain, thank you for your patience. Hoping to RP with most of you soon!",

It's nice you decided to drop by.\n\nGolden Correction is a roleplay-server acting as a sequel to a High-School Roleplay by the name of Golden Apple Highschool. The previous school was run by Principal D'Avis and, for the most part, was in good hands and shape.\n\nTurns out things weren't as good as they seemed. Neither are D'Avis' intentions. With the school shutting down due to 'health-issues' D'Avis bought a new facility, coming one step closer to fullfilling his needs and basically using his positive reputation as a cover-up for what goes on behind the scenes.\n\nThe building is a former prison, thus still following the standards of that. It was revamped a little on the outside to make it look more inviting, however parents who bring their 'troubled youth' there, are not allowed to go beyond a certain wall.\n\nYes. That's right. This facility is for troubled youth. Most of those young criminals but also mentally unstable youth.\n\nDive in deeper to let a trip of inhumane life unravel right in front of your very eyes.\n\nhttps://discord.gg/u8rux44",

            "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am looking for a literate partner for a gothic fantasy themed roleplay. Our characters would be something akin to monster hunters, members of a shadowy and mysterious group that protects mankind from vampires, werewolves, demons and other creatures. The story would be set in a fantasy world with humanity currently going through an industrial revolution very similar to our own. Railway lines are being constructed, cities are now bustling metropolises lit by gas-lamps and armies use guns and cannon, not swords and shields. The world would have some strong parallels to our own, with fictional nations based loosely on real counterparts. Magic is a force in the world, and while potent, is rather rare amongst humans.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe story would follow with a good deal of adventure and intrigue, as our characters deal with not only the beings that threaten humanity, but also rival groups and institutions that have goals different from their own. There would be a large cast of characters to get to know of both friends and foes, as well as plenty of opportunities for more relaxed drama, such as masquerade balls put on by the nobility, holiday festivals and romantic dinners out about town. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYour character would be in your own hands, and its up to you to decide if she is familiar with the monsters in the story, or has been raised her whole life with hunting them in mind. Did she find herself a young orphan having to dart about city alleys, or was she born into the prestige and luxury of the upper classes? Its up to you! That includes who you want your character to romance, if romance at all, but we will go into more detail before we actually start writing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI roleplay exclusively on discord and can manage about one reply a day, sometimes less, sometimes more. I often write 2-3 paragraphs, and while I dont expect you to match me I would like more than just a few lines from you. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you would like to really impress me, please include a writing sample with your PM. If you have any questions ask in the comments below. That way other people can see my answers. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope to hear from you soon",

Most 'realistic' modern scenes fall under what I would do - college, roommates, band members, brothers-in-arms, drug addict x dealer, anything else you can think of that isn't fantasy based, basically. (These are often just jumping-off-points and the roleplay becomes more slice-of-life from there.)",

I am admittedly a little rusty. I am not as good of a writer as I used to be but I hope whoever decides to join me will be a tad bit accepting of my faults. With your forgiveness I can promise you that I will do my very best to make each post I make as enjoyable as possible. For the plot I had in mind I was hoping to go into a survival post-apoc. I have never done this before and it is a bit out of the norm central theme wise. So, I hope that you would be excited to try this out as me. I was thinking making it around the idea of say Fallout or walking dead. Without the brilliant charm of a team of writers working on story boards (Fallout) or the depression soaked reality of watching your loved ones get killed(The walking dead). I was in fact hoping for something in between with a little bit of smut thrown in should the plot devolve into that lane. If anyone is interested please don't hesitate to send me a message and we will figure out a way to start this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you everyone and have a good night.",

These characters would be ones who are more frequently denied due to the subject of mental illness, physical disability, or even sexuality or gender! \n\nI'm not knocking the people who don't want to RP with certain characters and I also recognize that sometimes it has nothing to do with the subjects mentioned above but more due to a poorly written OC and has nothing to do with the disabilities, personalities (or lack thereof) or identities. Either way choices are choices for a reason and you shouldn't feel pressured to rp with a character or person you dislike. \n\nHowever, in this RP I am looking for exceptionally written but rarely used characters! Characters with a personality behind their mental or physical illness and/or identity. Send me a message detailing as much as you want about the character or characters you would wanna RP. From there we can discuss and move onto discord if all goes well!\n\nI really look forward to seeing and rping with your OCs that never got their chance to shine.

My little corner of the vast, beautiful world of roleplaying that just makes me tick.\n\nAnd that is\u2026 character driven slice of life plots, with romance being a must.\n\nCharacter development is what I live for! The way characters can drive a story, their inner thoughts, and what makes them, well them - it\u2019s my absolute favorite. I just love watching a character unfold in a plot. Getting to know them. Watching them grow and develop. So I am not looking for a specific prompt, but someone who is as excited about exploring characters as I am.\n\nWe can of course build a plot or a world for the characters to live in. Or, we can just toss two characters together and see how the plot builds based on their backstories, lives, personalities, etc.\n\nI have a few starting ideas, but I am very open to other ideas! If you have a craving, come at me! Suggest it! I may love it! I also may be open to adding elements of crime, fantasy or science fiction. Cause I mean. That\u2019s just fun sometimes.\n\nOKAY! So to get to the point, somewhat, here are a few rules. \n\n\u2022 21+ only (25+ preferred) please. As I get older I find that writing with people closer to my own age helps in the collaborative writing process.\n\n\u2022 3rd person. Past tense. Paragraph format. Discord or email.\n\n\u2022 3+ paragraphs minimum per post, unless we agree to do quick dialogue snippets. I commonly do more than the 2,000 character limit on Discord.\n\n\u2022 Understanding of real life obligations. Some weeks I can reply multiple times a day, sometimes once or twice a week, it will depend. I will always let you know if I will be away for more than a day or two. Ghosting is, in opinion, the worst issue plaguing the roleplay community right now. So I promise never to just disappear.\n\n\u2022 Doubling, or male characters. I love to double, and when I do I will play a female and a male character. But if we are not doubling, I do want to play the female character.\n\n\u2022 MxF dynamics. But if there are platonic relationships in the story, any orientation is welcome for those characters, it is just in a romantic pairing MxF is my preference.\n\n\u2022 Literacy. While I am not going to get out my thesaurus and word count ... I adore long, detailed posts with intricacies. I love reading a post that I can tell has been thought out and edited. I am happy as a clam if you put in effort and excitement. Of course, I also love shorter back and forth posts for dialogue or certain scenes. It all depends. If you give me something to interact with, activity and interest, I will be a happy lil' lady.\n\n\u2022 Long-term. Please! Let us dive into a story and get lost. Have our fingers itching to get that ding of an email or Discord message. It's like a crush. And it's great - or I am crazy, who knows.\n\n\u2022 Short-term. I am also open to shorter stories as well! Maybe the two characters don\u2019t click, or one of us is not feeling it, or maybe a story finds its perfect ending quicker than we intend. That is fine! Let\u2019s communicate. Talk to each other. Be honest. End the story and create something new!\n\n\u2022 Be excited about OOC chatting, plotting, planning, sharing images, and asking little \u201cwhat if\u201d questions about our story. If those little writing additives do not excite you, I will probably annoy you. I might be old these days, but I do still have the excitement level of a small child sometimes.\n\n\u2022 Be upfront about any limits or desires that you might have. I have a few limits myself, but not many, and I am looking to include adult content in my stories. So I always want to make sure we are on the same page, traveling down the same path with ideas.\n\n\u2022 Please introduce yourself in your PM to me. At least a little! While I will do my best to reply to everyone who sends me a message, I will be much more excited and happy to get a story going if you do not simply write \u201cwanna rp?\u201d and press send. Please include your email or Discord handle in your PM, just so I know you perused everything in my post and so we can get going on a great story :)\n\nThat is really it! Have more questions? Need more specifics on genres, limits, samples of my writing \u2013 all that jazz, feel free to ask!\n\nI hope to hear from you!!!",

            "selftext": "Riley Turner loved three things in this world. Her job, a cup of hot coffee, and her son Owen. When Owen's father stumbled out of her life years ago, claiming a kid was too much, Riley had thought it was the end of the world. But landing her dream job as a caomic book illustrator meant she could work from home and spend even more time with her son. Sure her dating pool was limited but she had swarn off men when Isaac walked out of the door. Meeting Owen's new teacher just might have her chabging into a bikini. \n\nApoligize for the incredibly cheesy prompt. The last few days I've been sick with a cold and the one thing that always makes me feel better are cheesy romance novels. So I'm looking for someone to help recreate that. We dont have to go with the prompt above but something equally cliche would be nice. \n\nA bit about me, I'm a 21 year old woman from the west coast. I've been roleplaying about 11 years now and rarely produce less then a paragraph, 2 tends to be my average. Now I will never win a spelling bee so i dont expect perfection from a partner, I do expect effort though. Beacause of the subject matter, I'm looking for someone 18+. After all romance nivels tend to get inappropriate at times. \n\nIf your interested please send me a message. I can write over reddit but I heavily prefer Discord. So reach out and we can start brainstorming.",

I have 3+ years of roleplay experience, so I am definitely capable of a variety of styles and genres to roleplay in, though most of my roleplays are slice-of-life romance roleplays, MxM to be precise, though I love fantasy as well. I am not comfortable doing a romance roleplay with a female character, though if you yourself are female and you wish to roleplay as male, that is completely fine.\n\nI love to talk outside of the roleplay as well and I have to be blunt about it; I have an eccentric personality, my favourite type of humour can be viewed as offensive by some, if you are incapable of handling offensive jokes or comments you are not the person I am looking for. You are hereby warned. Now then, for the roleplay, I have set up some basic rules that you must be able to oblige as well as some facts about what type of roleplays I do. \n\nAT LEAST 5 full sentences per response\n\nI don\u2019t do fandoms \n\nSmut is always a plus, but it has to come naturally! \n\nThird-person\n\nPast tense\n\nGrammatically correct\n\nAt least one response per day (Unless you are busy of course, don\u2019t force yourself!)\n\nBe committed to Roleplay! If you know that you are often incapable of roleplaying for longer periods of time (more than one week) then we are not a match. \n\nI really hope that I have piqued your interest and you are willing to roleplay with me. I use discord as my roleplaying platform, so you will have to give me your discord username through PM if you wish to roleplay with me, and say 'Pillowfight' first, so I know that you read this entire message.

            "selftext": "Just looking for someone who has similar tastes as me when it comes to RP. I\u2019m wanting something long-term. Not looking for a GM, and I\u2019m not a GM, more something we brainstorm together and just have fun doing. I like thinking up a fun story we can both get into, and building a good character (and NPCs, etcetera.) to go with it. \n\nPlease be 18+, as I\u2019m an adult.\n\nI only write in third person. I write multiple paragraphs. Usually averaging 2-4 but honestly it varies on what\u2019s going on, I can do more. I think good spelling and grammar is awesome. Although, let\u2019s face it, mistakes definitely happen! I just want to understand things well, and have fun. I\u2019m pretty descriptive and love getting immersed in the story. \n\nI\u2019m not new to RP, kinda new to Reddit, sorta new to Discord. But I\u2019ve been RPing for about seven years or so. In my experience it would be best to have a partner who is patient. I can do a back and forth mostly during weekdays, during the day. I\u2019m usually not up all night. (EST.) But sometimes it varies. I\u2019ll reply when I can. \n\nMy strongest suite is high fantasy/medieval genre. I\u2019m open to low fantasy/medieval, and post apocalyptic as well in a slice of life setting. Weaker points would be Sci-Fi and things like that. I do enjoy romance if the chemistry is right. World building is okay, to a degree, as long as it isn\u2019t overly complicated. Lol And I don\u2019t really do fandoms, but I could try? I\u2019m not into a lot of that stuff, so it\u2019s kinda hard for me when I\u2019m so unfamiliar, I guess. \n\nFeel free to message me. We\u2019ll see how it goes and move on from there. Thank you.",

Something that follows our two main characters in their lives, with the addition of minor characters now and then to richen the story. Definitely slow build to establish relationships, behaviors, characteristics, etc. and to develop a style between us!\n\nI am strictly looking for \u201cslice of life\u201d, romance-based, day to day/day in a life sort of stories, so nothing sci-fi, medieval, or ship-based (sorry!). NSFW scenes are more than welcome in the RP, but I do strongly prefer that they are slow-builds and do not become the main focus of the RP :) I do use first-person when writing, so I hope that\u2019s not an issue.\n\nI have a few ideas in mind, and some abandoned ones that I would love to recreate, if that sounds interesting, but I am also open to any and all ideas! I\u2019m kind of in an idea rut, so DM or chat me with some pitches!\n\nI am really looking for a partner who can commit (for the most part - I know life happens and if I ever can\u2019t chat as much, I\u2019ll be sure to let you know and hope you can do the same!) to a long-term RP that gets at least a little further each day. I do prefer longer paragraphs/detail in the RPs, but I also know that sometimes a sentence is all it needs. Also, the occasional chat outside the RP would be nice as I like to make friends as well!\n\nI know that\u2019s a lot to take in, so thank you for reading this far! If any of this sounds interesting to you, feel free to DM or chat me, and we can talk more about what we're both interested in and see if it works out! If I don't respond right away, it's most likely because my message notifications for reddit get messed up sometimes, so sorry in advance!",

            "selftext": "The year was 1974 and Fred Jackson was driving with his daughter on their way home from a hunting trip. It was a stormy ride, but they were quite comfortable in their brand new ford pickup. The storm was unusual, lightning flashed in a circular pattern above the truck and Fred got out to check the horses in the trailer. As Fred got back in the truck, light engulfed the vehicle and then everything went dark. Fred woke up to his daughter curled up against him, the scenery was different, the road had wagon and hoof prints from horses instead of tire marks. A fat man in colonial dress topped the hill and came into view. With a terrified expression, the man turned and galloped his horse away.\n\nSeveral years later, Fred had set up a home for himself and his daughter. The year was 1778 and the American Revolution was in full force. He had served in the marines in Vietnam, and was a patriotic man, but he stayed home to care for the small farm he created. He began to court a woman named Eliza, a beautiful widow a few years younger than him. His daughter had her eyes on a young soldier garrisoned nearby at an American camp named Martin. \n\nHe kept the truck hidden from the world, trying to live a life normal to the times, but when the dragoons show up, will he have to reveal who he is to save the ones he loves?\n\nThis is the starting scenario of the rp. Hoping to find someone who will play Eliza or Martin, or both. I will play as Fred or his daughter as the  main character and the rest will be lesser characters. \n\nI prefer around a paragraph of writing to keep it detailed, you\u2019re more than welcome to write more if you wish, but I ask you to please stay at or above the minimum.\n\nI can rp in first or third, minor characters will be done in third person regardless.\n\nMessage me for my discord and ask any questions you had",

            "selftext": "Hey, I'm a 22 year old female from the UK. I have had a plotline in my head that ive been itching to write solo for weeks now, but whenever I sit down in an attempt to write the first chapter, nothing. I think I'm just so used to writing with another person and adore my partners creativity so much that now I can't write alone! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy idea for this RP is a forbidden romance blossoming between two young women, one of which is betrothed to the others ill-tempered, abusive brother. They are both members of two large, influential families who are involved in questionable activities. I've written down some more details. Please keep in mind that first names/last names and even the plotline is not set in stone. I'd love to brainstorm with my future partner and see what suits us both :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Sable Street is a story about two young women who are forced to navigate through a corrupt existence in a city which just so happens to be run by their families, the Lockwoods and the Mountfords, both distinguished names in present day politics.*\n\n*Childhood companions, Roz Lockwood and Clara Mountford were as thick as thieves. It is fair to say that the two were dragged through their adolescent years by the scruffs of their necks in an attempt to groom them in a way their families saw fit. During this time the girls bonded closely over their adventurous spirits and their shared struggles in adjusting to a course which had been laid out for them with no input of their own.* \n\n*The pair lost contact in their teenage years, encouraged sternly by their parents to focus on their own obligations. Clara was led down a pathway decorated with the alluring flashing lights of showbiz and was taught how to flirt with the cameras, whereas Roz was forced to toughen up and get her hands dirty with blood, sweat and tears, forced to navigate her way through her fathers vast criminal enterprises whilst live up to his expectations.*\n\n*When it is revealed that Clara and Harrison, the eldest Lockwood brother, are expected to marry, emotions run high. Both women are simply aching with excitement at the thought of a reunion, yet Roz can't shake an underlying fear for Claras safety at the hands her brother who has displayed signs of dangerous sociopathic tendencies ever since they were children.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wrote this up pretty hastily so please excuse any grammatical errors. Nothing is set in stone and id love to find a partner who wants to help me build an exciting world around these two sweethearts. I'd be playing Rose (Roz) and you'd be playing Clara (Or any name you choose for her). Any questions? I'm happy to answer! My idea for this RP is that a forbidden romance between the two women forms, perhaps stemming from some withheld feelings in their teenage years, which is pretty scandalous considering Clara is marrying Roz' brother and also pretty dangerous considering his temperment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease keep in mind that the themes in this RP will be pretty dark and NSFW at times. We will be delving into mental illnesses, violence, drugs, crime, sex, ect. I'm fine with writing out smutty scenes, though understand that sometimes a fade to black is called for!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI write 3rd person and I'm a sucker for details. I prefer lengthy paragraphs, so my posts tend to be anywhere between 200-400 to 1000 words depending on how inspired I am and if the scene calls for it. I love describing how my character feels and what they are thinking as, for me, it adds to my character development. I'm super friendly and easy to get along with and I'm open to all kinds of ideas, so don't be scared to approach me about them! I only write on discord and I love to communicate OOCly!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you are interested, please send me a message, id love to hear from you. Perhaps send me a writing sample so I can see if we mix well? Ill send you one back!",

A 22 year old roleplayer who is in search of a new, literate partner! \n\nI\u2019ve been roleplaying for around 8 years now, but recently I took a fairly long break of three months from it due to work and some other life things, but I\u2019m finally free enough to post and find some partners! \n\nA little bit about me; I currently reside in Arizona and attend NAU to become a Solar Astronomer. I love writing, reading, sports, eating and sleeping haha. I am fairly available throughout the day, but sometimes you\u2019ll get spotty responses if I\u2019m at work or in class, but if I\u2019m not, I\u2019ll be sure to respond as soon as possible. I\u2019m off the whole weekend so my responses shouldn\u2019t take too long, and if they do, I apologize in advanced!\n\nI roleplay in first or third, depending on my partners preference. I also love basically any genre, but my favorites would probably have to be; apocalyptic, romance, sci-if or drama. I\u2019m basically up for anything, so hopefully we can brainstorm an idea out together or you can bring your own idea if you have any!(:\n\nI prefer literate writing, so basically anything below 2-3 paragraphs really isn\u2019t my thing. I understand it depends on the scene, but I don\u2019t like quick, couple sentences replies. Ruins the fun!\n\nI\u2019m available on Discord or here! So let me know where you\u2019d rather chat when you message me!\n\n\nHope to hear from all of ya!\n\nAlex",

            "selftext": "[M4F]Star Wars: Divided We Fell\n\n \n\n**\u201cWhat I remember about the rise of the empire was. . . . was how quiet it was. During the waning hours of the clone wars the 501st legion was discreetly transferred back to Coruscant. It was a silent trip. We all knew what was about to happen, what we were about to do. Did we have any doubts, any private traitorous thoughts? Perhaps, but no one said a word. Not on the flight to Coruscant, not when order 66 came down, and not when we marched into the Jedi Temple. Not a word.\u201d** \\- *501st Clone Trooper*\n\n*WARNING*: I am looking for a niche role play partner, for there are a few pre-requisite in terms of character being made. Also the role play will take place on Discord.\n\nQuick Introduction-\n\nHello there! I am Crow, a literate role player seeking for more like minded people to help me develop a story I have had planned for a while. As for literate I should explain myself on that. While I ideally strive for 3 - 5 paragraphs, I do understand that some scenes in the role play stagger in nature and at most only 1 paragraph can be written, and I understand that. I just don\u2019t want the role play to remain in that 1 paragraph state. I know this is important to others, so I would like to make it known that I am okay with NSFW content, as long as it is not the main driving force of this role play. And now back to your regularly scheduled show.\n\n***Star Wars: Divided We Fall***\n\nA role play set from the beginning of the Clone Wars, dragging our main characters through the many conflicts that broke down the galaxy, to the pivotal moment when Order 66 was enacted, and at last: to the end of the Empire\u2019s tyrannical rule. This role play is an anthology, loosely tied to the main plot of the Clone Wars, Original Trilogy, and E.U material afterwards (because E.U seems more interesting than whatever Disney is brewing up right now). I wish for this role play to be gritty and explore the realities of war, similar to how Clone Wars did so towards the ending of their show. \n\nOnto more specifics, I would wish to explore something that was never (or rarely) touched upon in the Clone Wars. Which was White Bounty Hunters / Mercenaries. We can talk more about this if you are interested, but we never got to see many bounty hunters working for the Republic because it is the right thing to do, with the exception of Bric and El-Les. This ties in to my main idea, which is to see this dynamic between our two main characters, mine starting off as a freshly ordained knight, and yours being an aforementioned white mercenary hired by the republic. \n\nI hope this intrigues you enough to consider taking on this role in the role play! If you read this far then I applaud you for sticking around to read my poorly structured post. PM me for more details (like my Discord!) and state which era of Star Wars is your favorite.",

M x F, M x M and F x F. \n\n6. Please be knowledgeable on the comics, not the movie.

            "selftext": "Hello! I go by Jam, and I\u2019m a longtime RPer that\u2019s still looking for another like-minded creative individual. Over the years I\u2019ve had the pleasure of writing with a plethora of people, in just about every genre imaginable. I\u2019ve cultivated friendships with them outside of writing that\u2019s led to some of the best RP\u2019s that have spanned years. So, when I look for a partner, I\u2019m looking for someone who wants something long-term, enjoys world building, character development, and story development before writing and through the RP itself. Hopefully you share those same values.\n\nI\u2019m primarily a novella style poster (Three paragraphs or more), but I also take into account what\u2019s going on in the story, as well as my partner\u2019s style. Quantity is certainly not everything. I do my best to make sure spelling, punctuation, and grammar are absolutely basic (What good is RP if you can\u2019t understand what I\u2019m typing?), so you should as well. I admit though, I have a love/hate relationship with commas. I also prefer google docs. I\u2019m open to Discord, but it\u2019s not really work friendly for me. We can talk about this.\n\nAs the title suggests, I\u2019m looking for RP set in one of the genres mentioned below (I'm open to your ideas as well). Original characters preferred. From there we can begin plotting things like world building, characters, character histories, background, and storytelling. Honestly, I can't state enough that this process is a favorite for me. I want to share the story, not run it. You shouldn\u2019t want to do so either. The flow should be automatic and the equilibrium between push/pull of events by writers should be balanced. I\u2019m an adult (Please be 21+), so please expect mature themes. \n\nAeon Trinity - Cyberpunk to the fullest. Science Fiction with a taste of realism. I have a site made with information to get new writers started.\n\nPost Apocolyptic - Something Mad Maxish, Doomish, or something completely original.\n\nStar Wars - It\u2019s Star Wars, not much more needs to be said. I tend to enjoy writing after major plots have happened. Ep3, Ep6, or between Ep6 - 7.\n\nMedieval Fantasy/High Fantasy - Might require a bit of world building, but I have some of that info from past writings if we choose to use it.\n\nModern Gods (Greek) - Something I've been interested in, but never really written.\n\nModern Fantasy - The 5th Age in Tolkien lore? Yes please. Think of the movie Bright on Netflix.\n\nModern Horror - World of Darkness. Vampires, wolves, fae, witches, and more. Oh my.\n\nWW2 - I'm not a history buff, but there's so much writing potential in this era as well.\n\nThis is just a bit of what's on my mind to write. Again, if you have any suggestions, I'll be open to them. So if you made it this far, thanks for reading. Shoot me a line if interested!",

Over.\n\nOh thank the gods, someone finally picked up. This is ranger Damsey of the Pine Force. I went to the old necromancer tower around Stonebrooke to clear out a small demonic infestation. That small demonic force turned out to a bone devil with many lesser fiends under his command. I am now trapped in said tower by the surrounding devils. I am requesting immediate back up from who ever is available for half the appointed reward. Over.\n\nYes my name is Damsey and I am trapped in a tower. Over.\n\nYes I get the irony. Over.\n\nStop laughing and just send whoever thinks they have enough snuff. Over.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHello this is my first attempt at a genuine role-play. If you cannot tell this has a an air of comedy to it, but I also see some room for action and maybe even romance. I love the idea of a cocky, egotistical ranger in a fantasy world who bit off more than he can chew. In this world I imagine all of the common fantasy archetypes are available such as bard, cleric, ranger, knight, etc. I think part of the fun of role-play is creating a world together and defining multiple characters together. Sorry I know that was rambly, but like I said this is my first time wanting to do what I consider a legitimate role-play and I am not quite sure what needs to be said. If you have questions, just shoot me a message. I hope to hear from you soon.",

I currently have no big ideas of my own at the moment, I simply know that I'd enjoy working something out with someone.\n\nAbout me: I roleplay in third person, I usually try to get at least a paragraph in per post but sometimes that can get difficult for me. I usually post at least once a day and I am most active at night around 8:30 to 9:30 eastern time. \n\nPreferred genres: Action/Horror, Action, Sci-Fi, slice of life/comedy (with a twist) and romance\n\nThings I'm not typically into: Medieval Settings, Medieval Fantasy, Historical, Realistic, Ghosts, Shapeshifters and religious deities. \n\nThank you if you've read this far!

How would they ascend to the throne, or would they? What paths/decisions will they choose, and how will this not only impact their future-but their kingdom\u2019s?*\n\nHey all! Happy Halloween! Tonight I am looking for a GM to try out a royal modern fantasy idea about a princess/prince that will be taking the throne within the next few years. This plot is totally adaptable, so I can have multi going at once! I do M x F (with myself as F) or M x M. \n\n\ud83c\udf19\ud83c\udf15\u2728\ud83d\udd2e~Rules~ \ud83c\udf19\ud83c\udf15\u2728\ud83d\udd2e\n\n1. Please be a literate person that can hold a reply. You do not need to give me a book, but I expect more than a few sentences. \n\n2. 3rd person please, no 1st! Sorry, not my thing! \n\n3. Be active, do not ghost! If you aren\u2019t feeling our plot, let\u2019s start a new one or part ways! Communication is key with me. \n\n4. Please be 18+. I\u2019m 20 something, and roleplaying with anyone younger than this just feels... weird. \n\n5. Be able to play multiple characters and have at least a small amount of GM experience! \n\n6. I do not believe in inserting one character into a plot. I make mine from scratch in every roleplay. This does not mean I need an extensive bio. I am pretty lax with this as long as I get the basic information of the characters. \n\nIf interested, shoot me a PM! Have a wonderful day and thank you for reading!",

To start this off, let me tell you a bit about myself ^-^\n\nI am from Europe (CET) and English isn\u2019t my first language, but I like to think I\u2019m fairly decent at it. Rp is one of my favorite things to do, and it has been (and still is!) a great way for me to improve my writing skills.\n\nI\u2019d prefer a literate partner (at least a few lines, decent grammar, spelling and punctuation please - I know, sounds funny coming from a non native English speaker, but please respect that), and someone who can typically respond a few times per day. \n\nMy absolutely favorite genre is fantasy! High fantasy, preferably medieval, and if you\u2019re interested in that as well, I\u2019d already love to speak to ya!\n\nAlrighty, just a bit more info, bear with me! \nI have a few ideas, but I\u2019d love to hear yours, too.\n\nI can play characters of both genders, but gravitate towards playing males, mostly. It really depends on the story, tho! \nI\u2018m open to romance (mxm and mxf are both equally welcome), but it is not required.\n\nIf you are interested in lord of the rings, the Silmarillion, or literally anything by Tolkien, PLEASE dm me, I\u2019ve been looking for such an rp for ages :) \nI mainly use discord to rp, but am willing to look into alternatives if we click well!\n\nIf you\u2019re interested, please pm me, or leave a comment! :)",

Not having to follow a single plot but rather to just follow a set of characters lives. I generally do. Romance, dark topics, Drama and NSFW (but not being like every 5 mins jeez) these are the main things that I generally have in my slice of life RPs and as well some fantasy elements like magic, different races, mythical creatures etc... I do prefer my partners to be 18+ as adult themes do get involved. As well as that semi lit at least will be ideal being able to write atleast 1 paragraph and not 1 line will be good enough. I generally use discord so if you are intrested give me a message",

I would like to play a canon character and You can be an OC or Canon character, I do not mind! I don\u2019t mind if you\u2019ve only watched the anime or read the manga, I just need to know just incase I might accidentally slip a spoiler out to someone who isn\u2019t caught up.\n\nUsually, when playing OCs, i\u2019d use a Reference Image, and if you wish to use one that\u2019s fine! Or just a few sentences or a few paragraphs about yours do nicely. Your own does not have to be Anime if you use an image by the way!\n\nOn the other hand, The Canon Character pairings when I do play them, i\u2019m fine with all of them (OC x Canon, and Canon x Canon) so you can play who you feel, even if it means crossover\n\nLike I said earlier, all the details will be discussed in Private. This can go many ways in terms of plot. May it perhaps be Dark, or Rather Sweet. You obviously may choose what role you have, however if you are unsure I have a few suggestions in the back of my mind!\n\nMy Rules Are for you to only be able to write more then 6 Lines, or a Paragraph per response is preferable. Please don\u2019t come to me if you\u2019re looking for a Quickie for other Subreddits are for that sort of thing, however I am always fine with Smut as long as that isn\u2019t the sole purpose of the Roleplay.",

However I would prefer to play an OC rather than Kirito or a canon character. \n\nI usually play in first person but I could do 3rd as well. \n\nAs a GM I do expect you to play many characters, as well as enemies, play the environment, and that's basically it. I don't think I'm a bad player to GMs as I will actually be doing stuff that could help a GM think of things to do or letting them do stuff based on my actions, since it is a group effort.\n\nI do above all else want this to be FUN for BOTH OF US. I love to RP and just to be able to relax and be in a different fun world. If I really care about you, then I wont even care if we RP, I'll just be glad to have a friend to talk to, vent to, listen to, yadda yadda. \n\nMessage me with any questions on Reddit or just send me your Discord, we will talk here or there. I also have a Kik but I prefer these in-depth RPs on Discord.",

I am seeking partners for a prompt that I've just come up with and would very much like to explore.\n\nDuring the colonization of Africa under Queen Victoria, the English discovered a rare and highly advanced metal that has propelled their technological advancement to extreme levels. Their top innovators quickly used this material to create all sorts of new retrofuturist inventions in the style of Jules Verne (space railways, cannons to the moon, laser muskets, flying galleons) and have taken to the stars in search of new lands. Other nations have begun developing this technology and used it to aggressively conquer their enemies, leading to a few large empires controlling most of Terra. The English, the Ottomans, the Germans, the Russians, the Japanese, and the Spainairds. All have begun space colonization in search of new resources and territory for their people, as well as other independent nations like America and France. \n\nWe play the Captain and Lieutenant of a ship chartered by the Honorable East India Company. Granted a Writ of Commerce stamped with the royal seal of Her Majesty Queen Victoria, we have been given full authority to travel to the farthest reaches of space and conquer unknown territory for the glory of England. We will have to deal with other human empires, random space phenomena, and alien kingdoms of varying degrees of development. We can decide to be diplomatic, business-oriented, or focused on violent conquest. Where we go and what we do is entirely in our hands.\n\nIf this story interests you, please shoot me a message and we can discuss ideas for our characters! If you are interested in the setting but would rather play as a different faction, let me know and we can discuss it. I look forward to hearing from you!",

I like to try and really paint a picture of what is happening.\n\nI have a basic foundation worked out in my mind, but I'm leaving it pretty open so that way my partner doesn't feel like they've been painted into a corner. This could just as easily be an \"equal partners\" situation as it could be a GM/player setup.\n\nDishonored is one of my favorite worlds, I think it offers different avenues of exploration.  I will say that so far I have played only the first Dishonored game to completion.  I'm currently playing D2 and finished the Royal Conservatory mission recently, haven't touched Death of the Outsider yet.\n\nI'm pretty flexible when it comes to formatting. We can RP here on Reddit, on Discord, or email/Google docs. Whatever my partner is comfortable with, I'll try my best to accommodate.\n\nHoping to get some orange envelopes!",

I am a literate and experienced, mature-age roleplayer who has played across multiple platforms including chat, emails and even MMOs. My interests lie in both the small-scale character building and the large-scale worldbuilding that accompanies it.\n\nWhat I am looking for in a partner is somebody similar who has a similar approach to mine. I believe that two way communication is key to success in a RP relationship and that the players should not only engage with each other, but also feel free discuss and suggest plot, story and worldbuilding ideas.\n\nI am looking for something specific with regards to my character; I will be playing a MtF Trans character. What stage of their transition they are at is open to negotiation, but regardless they identify and present as female.\n\nI am interested in original worlds and settings based around Cyberpunk, Sci-Fi, Post-Apocalyptic and Low Fantasy genres. I have a few basic ideas I can work from for each of these, but I am also very much open to ideas and collaboratively building a world. I am only looking for one-to-one RP, not group games. I am not averse to including NSFW elements, but only as a part of the story, rather than for the simple sake of it.\n\nI prefer to play via email or Discord. If you are interested, please PM me. I will not reply to posts on this thread or chat requests.",

I usually prefer brainstorming with the other person to create our own world, and usually use OCs other than cannon characters to roleplay as (in case of a fandom, but that's open for discussion anyway). I'm looking for a long term partner, as I enjoy befriending my roleplay buddies, and be able to talk out of ooc at times just for getting to know each other better. I only roleplay in third person, and try to have the minimum response at least at one paragraph length. I'm pretty active, depending on how hectic work is or not (I work as a game tester, I have days when I do nothing, and days filled with chaos), but I always make sure to respond daily, and at least five times or more. If you're interested, please PM me! I do roleplays on Discord (mainly nowadays), Kik and Wattpad. Thank you!",

            "selftext": "First of all, a bit about me. I am an experienced, mature RPer who has a number of years of experience in different formats, including face-to-face, email, forums and the like. Primarily, I am interested in character interaction and development, especially through storytelling, conversation and relationship building. I like to see well developed, well thought out and believable characters. I prefer exotic or unusual settings, primarily science fiction, cyberpunk or post-apocalyptic. \u201cReal world/slice of life\u201d scenarios aren\u2019t that interesting to me; if it's something like a military or espionage setting, maybe, but not something 'mundane'. With that being said, I\u2019m open to ideas if they\u2019re original or creative or a little unusual.\n\nI generally like well-written, well thought out posts, and definitely prefer quality over quantity. I don\u2019t want to read a novel with each post, but I don\u2019t want to see one-line-wonders. Similarly, I am a stickler for grammar and spelling and punctuation, although I am prone to the odd bout of ferocious typos myself. However, as long as the intent is there, then I\u2019m happy.\n\nMy interests lie in mutual storytelling and creativity, rather than playing along to somebody else\u2019s story or the like. I control my character, I decide what\u2019s going on with them, I create their background and so on. I ask for my partners to respect that, as I will do the same for them. Likewise, I will never launch a major story element or a plot twist or the like without okaying it with a partner, as I would expect them to do the same for me. If I do something a partner doesn't want, then I'll gladly change it, but I ask that they will do the same for me.\n\nWhat I am looking for at the moment is a Roleplay set in the **Battletech** (or **Mechwarrior** if you prefer) universe. I am fairly open to ideas and settings, although I also have a few of my own. While this is a Tabletop RPG based universe, I'm looking for free-form writing rather than a system-based game.\n\nIf you are interested, please contact me by **PM**. I will not reply to messages posted here",

            "selftext": "Heyo! \n\nI\u2019m looking for another writing partner and have decided to be a bit more selective this time around compared to my previous searches. I\u2019ll get right into it! \n\nI\u2019m 25+ and have been writing (mainly RP) for 15+ years. I write in multi-paragraph style, 500-700 words per post on average \u2013 but it can vary greatly depending on context.   \n More info on my website, for those who are curious: [https://ailitherp.weebly.com/](https://ailitherp.weebly.com/) (although it could do with an update again by now\u2026).\n\n \n\nPREFERENCES   \n \\- 21+ minimum but 25+ is preferable as that would be closer to my own age. \n\n\\- Advanced level writing: I have a fair amount of experience roleplaying and a good grasp on the English language in general and in this case,  I expect the same from my would-be partner. Be prepared to be asked for a writing sample as proof of compatibility.\n\n\\- 3rd person, past tense \u2013 multi-paragraph style writing. Exceptions are acceptable in the right circumstances, e.g. rapidfire conversation or action scenes. \n\n\\- Fantasy, Modern, and Historical(ish) genres. Possibly Slice of Life if given a particularly interesting plot. \n\n\\- OOC plotting and chatter on Discord. I love to plot, discuss and share things about our story, and sometimes stuff outside of it if we get along well.\n\n\\- Someone who is willing to write both genders and who enjoys adding NPCs, side-characters, and more main characters alike depending on what the story needs. I can play both genders, and although my comfort zone is female mains I tend to do far more males as soon as I\u2019m playing more than one main character. If you lean more towards male characters, that might still work, but if you intend to mainly/only play female \u2013 this is your cue to move on. \n\n\\- 1-2 posts per week, potentially more when the mood and time allows it. I work full time and do not have the luxury of being able to post while at work, so RPing only happens during my free time where it has to contend with my other hobbies and responsibilities \u2013 even if it does take precedence a lot of the time. \n\n\\- Romance (MxF only) in various forms, I tend to prefer the complicated or the slow-burning kind. Basically, I enjoy the tension and drama it can create as well as the character development it tends to lead to \u2013 but I am notorious for never making life easy for my characters.\n\n\\- NSFW allowed and encouraged, but secondary to plot. Especially with smut, I want it not to be frivolous and to make sense. Sometimes fading to black is preferable. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have an array of ideas to share, and I hope you do too \u2013 so that we can create amazing worlds and stories together!\n\nPlease introduce yourself if this piques your interest and you end up throwing me a DM \u2013 it makes you seem far more interested (and *interesting*) than a simple \u201cHi\u201d would. If you can\u2019t produce a better first contact message than \u201cWanna RP?\u201d, then you might as well not message me as I will most likely ignore it. ;)\n\nAlso note that I am only looking for one new partner at this time, since I already have a couple active stories going on. As such, if I get multiple replies (one can hope!) I\u2019m going to have to make a no doubt difficult decision on whom to proceed with. Please don\u2019t take it personally if it doesn\u2019t end up being you. :)",

I can actually just GM this, I don\u2019t mind! But I understand some want input, and I\u2019ll respect your choice if you ask!\n\nI would also like to include romance, but that\u2019s optional, I just prefer it.\n\nSomeone that could play multiple characters would be a plus!

The year 2137 WWIII started, and the end of it sparked the first-ever instance of magic ever seen. Some attribute it to God becoming too angry with mortals, others believe science found a breakthrough and attempted to use it within the war, and some even believe it was just a coincidence. But no matter the reason, a pod-like island sprang up from the middle of the Atlantic ocean and remains the center of intense magic that no one yet dared explore, due to what happened to the sea life near it, which act somewhat as guards, barring entrance. However, this pod radiates an intense frequency that interferes with the world around it, even spawning large pillars that emanate the same frequencies on other lands. Most of these effects are barely noticeable, some protective, some destructive, but the biggest thing that changed upon the emergence of that pod is that it done to the inhabitants of earth.* \n\n*A very small amount of people gained magical abilities, seemingly from their most deeply rooted desire. The extent of their power was from small little perks to near god-status, but this sudden gain of abilities tended to occur when that deepest desire reaches it's peak, or 'true realization' within that person. Some theories suggest that most people do not gain powers because they can live an entire life not knowing what they TRULY desire, others claim that there is an active entity of sorts choosing people to gain power, since the majority of those who gained power tend to be abit more... eccentric than others.*\n\n\\-\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, the interesting part of this concept is I won't tell you the characters you will run into on purpose. Your character can have any quest you choose, or none at all. This \"game\" will adapt to your character, meaning I can add things that can cater to your wants if you'd like, or you can be taken for a wild (and potentially bloody) ride.  \n\n\nIf you're interested in this, we can talk more if you shoot me a PM c; See ya' round!",

            "selftext": "*In Japanese folklore, kitsune are characterized as these fox spirits capable of shapeshifting and other mystical feats. Every century, these creatures will grow another tail\u2014the more tails they have, the more powerful they become. Depending on the legend, they are often portrayed as vixens who siphon life from mortals. Upon reaching nine tails, kitsune are believed to ascend into the heavens.*\n\n*My take on kitsune is slightly different. The main gimmick which I\u2019ve added to the equation is a soulmate\u2014a human who shares a spiritual connection to the kitsune. However, since humans don\u2019t live nearly as long as kitsune, this human must undergo a cycle of reincarnation. Every century, they are reborn, destined to meet the kitsune again.*\n\n*Instead of growing a new tail every century, kitsune grow a tail when they perform a bonding ritual with their reincarnated soulmate. Once they reach their ninth tail, they along with their soulmate will ascend into the afterlife, forever together.*\n\n*\\~\\~\\~*\n\n*Five centuries ago, there existed a kingdom which dwarfed all others. The Kingdom of Riela was the world\u2019s main power, boasting a culture and economy which was unprecedented. This prosperity, however, was artificial. The secret to their success was the Nexus\u2014a strange orb which was brimming with a seemingly limitless amount of primordial magic. By harnessing its power, Riela existed in perpetual golden age.*\n\n*At the top was King Cazarossa, a benevolent ruler who spoiled his people. And at his side was Your Character, the queen of Riela. But Your Character was no ordinary queen, she was a kitsune and soulmate to the king.*\n\n*King Cazarossa loved Your Character very much. So much so that he was not content with the cycle of reincarnation. Wishing to never be separated from his soulmate, he searched for a way to circumvent this cycle\u2014to make himself immortal.*\n\n*One day, his court wizard proposed a solution to the king\u2019s dilemma. Through a ritual which combined the Nexus\u2019s power and dark magic, the court mage believed that he could make the king immortal. The king, motivated by their devotion to Your Character, decided to go through the ritual.*\n\n*The results were successful\u2014the king no longer aged. However, the ritual did more than that. The king was no longer the same man. His personality became twisted, malevolent even.*\n\n*After becoming immortal, King Cazarossa turned to conquest, setting his sights on the rest of the world. Thus began the Era of Madness. Using the raw power of the Nexus, the Mad King launched a vicious offense on the rest of the world.*\n\n*One day, Your Character decided that she could no longer stand by the Mad King\u2014soulmate or not. Taking matters into her own hands, Your Character stole the Nexus and fled into the wilderness.*\n\n*After almost two centuries, the world was left shocked by the mad King\u2019s untimely death. The details surrounding his death were unclear. Some theorized that the immortality ritual had been faulty\u2014that he had simply aged at a slower rate. Regardless of the cause, the Era of Madness came to an end and the Kingdom of Riela collapsed, splitting into three separate territories.*\n\n*\\~\\~\\~*\n\n*The Emerlyian Forest is a woodland so large that it\u2019s size could rival that of entire nations. It\u2019s sheer size can be attributed to the Nexus\u2014the entity which Your Character stole three centuries ago. The Nexus which had once fueled an entire kingdom now sits at the heart of this forest, sustaining its life.*\n\n*Your Character has since taken the role as a guardian over Nexus. Over the centuries, Your Character has formed a symbiotic relationship with it\u2014the Nexus acts as a source of vitality for Your Character, and she protect it from anyone who would seek to misuse its power.*\n\n*My Character is the reincarnation of the Mad King and soulmate to Your Character. Due to the immortality ritual conducted by his previous incarnation, his reincarnation cycle was thrown into disarray. Instead of reincarnating in the following century, it took three hundred years for him to reincarnate.*\n\n*In his current life, My Character is the former lord of Rosemore. Key word being \u201cformer\u201d. After a recent and particularly bloody coup, he is now on the run. In a last ditch effort to escape some of his pursuers, he chose to enter the Emerlyian Forest. While he succeeded in losing most of his pursuers, the plan quickly backfires when he becomes hopelessly lost in the dense woods. After days of aimless wandering, My Character stumbles into a clearing hidden deep within the forest. There, he has a fated encounter with Your Character.*\n\n**Two souls destined to meet. Forever and always.**\n\n\\~\\~\\~\n\nHi and hello!\n\nLet me just thank you for reading this far\u2014I know how lengthy that thing was. So yeah, as you can see, I am looking for someone to play the kitsune in this here plot I've made. But first! Let me share a little about myself. I\u2019m a 20ish male living in the PST zone. Despite having majored in economics, my true passion has always been in writing. As of lately, I've been trying to pick up the habit of writing daily. Hopefully, having a partner will encourage me to do just that.\n\nI simply adore a good fantasy. Heck, I\u2019d go so far as to call myself a fantasy-phile. Something about the genre will always stir something in me\u2014even more so when romance is involved. However, the romance needs to be a slow-burn, one where trust is built steadily between our two characters. As far as triggers, I don't have many\u2014I'm not the one to shy away from darker elements. I like to push my characters through the dirt and really do a number on them.\n\nI don't want to sound too picky, but I have some standards:\n\n* I'm looking for a fellow writer, preferably a native English speaker.\n* I'm more comfortable around people my age, so please be 18 or older.\n* Third person, past tense, please.\n* Post frequency: Multiple times a day would be ideal (especially when our characters are sharing dialogue). Once a day is the bare minimum.   \n* Post length: Quality over quantity, I'm pretty lax regarding how long your posts are.\n* Surprises! I have a couple in store for this plot, so I might be a little secretive at times. I also love to be surprised.\n* I tend to prefer illustrated face claims. Call me juvenile.\n* Discord is my platform of choice, but I'm willing to discuss other sites.\n\nHopefully none of that has deterred you. If you are interested, please send me a message. And don't be a stranger! Please tell me about yourself because I love hearing about my partners.",

Just a scene where you get into the role, have some fun, and done.\n\nHowever, I'm looking for a longterm partner, because who wants to keep jumping from person to person?\n\nPreferably someone who's literate and open to different roles. It's fun being different people and characters from rp to rp.. But if you prefer to always be a shy character, for example, that's okay too. First person is preferable, but I can do 3rd.\n\nIf you're interested in being my partner than we can talk in more detail over PMs about roles, preferences, etc. I'm free pretty much any day of the week. I'm open to any roles or scenarios you have to offer; again, being different people is enjoyable for me, so fire any ideas you got at me.",

Before I get to the ideas I have, there are some things I would like to go over.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u273f**You don't have to be literate or super detailed.** I'm a easygoing roleplayer that cares more about fun character interactions than word count. But, try not to one-line. At least post a paragraph, or as much as you feel a scene needs. Just make sure you are adding enough to keep the story progressive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u273f**Have good grammar and put punctuation where they need to go.** Typos and mistakes happen, so that's OK. But, I do want to understand your posts. It will make it easier for me to reply.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u273f**I will not roleplay romantic themes with anyone under 18.** I feel more comfortable this way since I am 18+. Even if you are over the age of 18, I will still keep romance rated G\uff5ePG.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u273f**We are both the GMs.** **Meaning, we have to help each other create a story to remember!** I don't want to be the only one coming up with all the ideas, you know? So, I'm looking for someone who cares about the RP and brainstorms from time to time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am also looking for someone who...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u3007Enjoys comedic moments, but can appreciate serious plots\n\n\u3007Can play as canon characters\n\n\u3007Can play as more than 1 character\n\n\u3007Friendly and communicative OOC (Outside Of Character)\n\n\u3007Can play as an antagonist if the RP calls for one\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, for the roleplays\uff5e\uff01\u266a I am going to share some ideas I thought of for each topic and the character(s) I will play as. I will be more characters if we need it though, but remember, you have to be willing to do the same. It will give our characters more characters to interact with. We will further plan the ideas on Discord.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**SUPER MARIO**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u273fI will be Toadette &amp; Wendy\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Mario Sunshine:** Toadette has a big problem! She is stranded on Sirena Beach because of a contract she accidentally signed. Before she took a flight to Isle Delfino, she booked a room at Sirena Beach's hotel, Hotel Delfino by mistake. She wanted to vacation at Delfino Plaza and stay at the hotel there, but didn't know the difference between both hotels. Hotel Delfino has a strict policy where guests cannot leave the beach until the contract expires after an entire year! To make matters worse, Wendy is trying to take over Isle Delfino.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Mario Party:** It's Wendy's birthday, and Bowser wants an authentic Mario Party experience for his little princess. In order for that to happen, Bowser kidnaps Princess Peach and keeps her whereabouts hidden. As a result, Mario was pretty much forced to fulfill Bowser's wish and host a 20 turn game of Mario Party. Mario has to not only defeat Bowser's children on the board, but also his friends. If Mario wins, Bowser will return Princess Peach back to Mushroom Kingdom... But, isn't that too good to be true? Toadette didn't want to be Mario's opponent, but this was all for Princess Peach's sake. Before the game begins, Toadette is looking for a teammate since the Mario Party match will be doubles.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Mario Kart:** Mario and friends live in a city where Mario Kart races are a part of life! Toadette is a reliable mechanic that fixes and upgrades vehicles at her workshop. But, when it comes to races, not everyone races fair. Wendy is a well known cheater and hates to lose. How far will she go to get her way on the track?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**SONIC THE HEDGEHOG**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u273fI will be Cream &amp; Charmy\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Sonic Heroes:** Amy comes across a rumor that says if she obtains all of the Chaos Emeralds, she will become the most beautiful girl in the world! I bet you can guess what she plans to do with that kind of beauty. Win Sonic's heart, of course! Thus, Team Rose reunites for another adventure, but in search of the Emeralds. Meanwhile, Charmy is on the hunt for mechanical flowers so he can gain access to a kingdom made out of honey!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Sonic Riders:** Cream dreams of having her very own Extreme Gear. She wants to be a part of the annual World Grand Prix, but Vanilla believes she is too young to ride one. There's a huge cash prize, and Charmy's going to help Vector take it all home by participating!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**KIRBY: RIGHT BACK AT YA!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u273fI will be Honey, Spikehead, and Iro\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kirby RBAY:** The cappy kids have always been a fun loving yet mischievous bunch. They still like to mess with King Dedede and ruin his property. But now, Honey, Spikehead, and Iro were given powers/weapons of their own and are using it irresponsibly. Who's bright idea was it to give them weapons? Cappy Town may have a big problem on their hands...!",

If anyone would like to discuss plot ideas and characters I'd be down!\n\n**SOME PAIRING IDEAS:**  \n*Killer x Prey (twisted romance?)*  \n*Survivor x Survivor (survival teamwork)*  \n*Killer x Killer (rivalry)*\n\n**DETAILS:**\n\n* My name is Elle.\n* I am 26 years old and seeking a partner **20+**\n* I would love a literate/semi-lit writer who can keep up with the length of my replies (2+ paragraphs)\n* Roleplaying to me is like writing a novel with two people. I would love someone who is as enthusiastic as I am about the plotline and **willing to bring ideas and plot twists to keep the story going.**\n* I am all about faceclaims (no anime or cartoons), gifs and Pinterest boards! *I'm the type of partner who will send inspirational songs in the middle of the night because the muse has spoken! lol*\n* I am not looking for a quick smut story. Although not opposed to NSFW content, I am seeking a **tasteful writer**.\n* I prefer writing third person but would love to discuss your preferences!\n* I usually play female characters but wouldn't be opposed to playing a male. (I would do FxF or MxF pairings)\n* Please send a reddit message with your favourite colour in the title so I know you are replying to this plot bunny.\n* **BONUS**: send me a plot idea, your preferred faceclaim, a character pinterest board or a writing sample for some extra love &lt;3\n\n**PLATFORMS:**\n\n* Discord\n\n**WRITING SAMPLE:**  \nHis eyes were a darker shade of mahogany than she had noticed before. He held her gaze with the hunger of a wolf; Those deep pools of dark-cinnamon swirls seized the dept and heaviness of words that were never dared spoken. As the air slowly drained from her lungs she noticed a twinkle of a smile danced at the edge of his lips.   \nHer vision began fading; his sharp edges began blurring, she sensed herself paling; her knees weakening. Just before the darkness washed over her;   \n*Jesse released his grip.*",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone, hope you\u2019re having a good day or whatever time it may be for you. After leaving reddit for a while and deciding to start fresh with a new account I\u2019ve also decided to come look for some more roleplay partners. You must be 18+ (will not except anyone younger than eighteen), must be okay with dark and adult themes as well as characters who aren\u2019t human (either being them or playing with them). You must also be able to post once or more a day at the absolute most and a maybe once or twice a week at the very least. You must also be literate and write in third person while giving me at the very least six or five lines and paragraphs at the most (if you\u2019re comfortable with doing so). I only rp as male characters (they\u2019re also more likely to be aliens or magical creatures) but I don\u2019t care whether you play as female or male since I\u2019m open to same sex stuff.  I also only do two fandoms (voltron and spyro) and will most likely not play as canon characters. You will also not get face claims or pictures from me as I have none but you will get written descriptions.Down below I\u2019ve put two examples so that we can either work from them or come up with an idea of our own.\n\n\n\nExample one: war of the worlds (sci-fi with war and possibly post apocalyptic themes)\n\n\n\nAliens and humans were never meant to coexist peacefully, it was simply not in their nature and there was so much fear from both sides that attempts to make treaties and bargains were more often than not declined. The war was something that neither race had wanted nor needed but the foolish humans had been the ones who had truly started it. A merchant ship passing by had been destroyed by a passing human fleet that had been carrying innocent aliens onboard, they\u2019d sworn revenge against the humans and a war like no other had been declared on the spot. The government now deployed any able man or woman out to space on large military ships and posted them on planets to try and establish bases before the aliens could. It didn\u2019t matter the dangers, as long as those bastard aliens didn\u2019t get territory first no one cared how many died for the cause.\n\n\n\nExample 2: rise of the dragon queen\n\n\n\nDragons. Dragons were creatures of vast intellect and raw power that was unmatched by any creature. They controlled the elements and ruled over the lands. There was on dragoness of course who had the powers of both the light and dark elements, a dragoness that everyone bowed down to. She was known as queen morgain starfire, the queen of all dragons. No one ever dared to question her, no ever dared to try and take her place from the throne and her bloodline was survived through her children who have all since been forgotten as the time passed and her reign was considered something of a story. No dragon could possess all the elements surely? While the dragons of old still stubbornly insisted that it indeed could happen many dragons who heard the stories now scoffed and went about their lives. Little did they know that deep somewhere far in the realm of magic an old darkness that morgain herself and the other rulers of old could not get rid of entirely lurked, waiting for the chance to break free and cause chaos once more and it would require the very myth no dragon believed in to be true if they were ever going to stop it.\n\n\n\nRemember, these are just examples of ideas that I put down. If you have an idea of your own feel free to tell me about it.I thing I shall mention now is that while I don\u2019t mind romance in the rp  (provided it\u2019s not forced or your sole focus) that it has to be slowburn and not your main focus. If I see that you\u2019re rushing the rp just so you can ship my character with yours then I am not going to continue rping with you. No romance after only one day please. For anyone interested in an rp please message me or leave a comment that says what platform you will be using to rp on, what idea you want to do or what idea you may have and the word NIGHT in the message or comment somewhere so that I know you read absolutely anything in this post.  Do not worry or think that because I may not have responded right away that I\u2019ve already found someone or I\u2019m purposely ignoring, Ive most likely not been notified by reddit or am quickly doing something else. I\u2019ll get back to anyone who messages me or comments.",

I don\u2019t mind if you\u2019ve only watched the anime or read the manga, I just need to know just incase I might accidentally slip a spoiler out to someone who isn\u2019t caught up. Also, on that scale I sit caught up on the anime!\n\nUsually, when playing OCs, i\u2019d use a Reference Image, and if you wish to use one that\u2019s fine! Or just a few sentences or a few paragraphs about yours do nicely. Your own does not have to be Anime if you use an image by the way!\n\nOn the other hand, The Canon Character pairings when I do play them, i\u2019m fine with all of them (OC x Canon, and Canon x Canon) so you can play who you feel, even if it means crossover\n\nLike I said earlier, all the details will be discussed in Private. This can go many ways in terms of plot. May it perhaps be Dark, or Rather Sweet. You obviously may choose what role you have, however if you are unsure I have a few suggestions in the back of my mind!\n\nMy Rules Are for you to only be able to write more then 6 Lines, or a Paragraph per response is preferable. Please don\u2019t come to me if you\u2019re looking for a Quickie for other Subreddits are for that sort of thing, however I am always fine with Smut as long as that isn\u2019t the sole purpose of the Roleplay.",

            "selftext": "\nVeloria, a land of magic, war and strangeness. The lands are vast, and different on every outreach of the territories, from wide and sunny plains where the grass grows tall and the flowers bloom almost allyear round, to tall and unforgiving mountains, where the snow covers most things that find place inside it, the winds capable of freezing those fool enough to come unprepared. Civilization is diveded into different regions, the dune settlers of Kazeria, where the dessert runs deep and the brown and yellowish color of the sand is all that can be seen for miles; The greenlands of Theros, where the capital of the Celtos empire stands, a huge city surrounded by flatlands, with a becon of light that shines through the sky coming from the tallest pillar in the middle of the city, a sign that most people follow for the hope of better future inside the urban civilization buzz with life, even though most will end up dying of hunger and on the streets, for the place is not welcoming, in spite of the rumours and legends of greatness inside the city; The ice realms of Solia, where the lands are ruthless, with small tribes scattered all around the snowy forests and tall mountains, only ruled by the sole desire of survival on the harsh conditions the people of the land live in; And lastly, the Great Keztos Kingdom, an empire ruled by a tyranny and an iron fist of the Red Council, a group of strategists and political figures who move the tides of their wars of conquest, ruling on top the capital city of the outskirts of Veloria way on the north, currently waging war against the Empire of Sand, Kazeria, to add into one of the kingdoms that have been consumed by the never stopping war machine that is the Keztos army. The fighting has been going on for a few months now, when the first advancement of soldiers and battle mages landed into the yellow dunes of sand, raiding the small villages of commoners and communities of shepherds on the outskirts of the Empire, but they have recently moved deeper inside the country, causing panic in most cities of sand, where the costant fear of the eminent attack of the red forces is always something on the minds of the poeple living daily inside the kingdom. But now, it's calm...\n\nMy name is Leo, the sole son of the chief of one of the many shepherds that travel around with their flock over the sand trails of Kazeria, my mother one of the head weavers of our tribe; I have a lean build, standing at 5'7 feet tall, though not athletic or muscular, i have tanned brown skin, which compared to the people of my region i am lighter tone of it, i have brown deep eyes with hezel hair, shortish, though some of it sometimes finds its way over my eyes when undone, which makes me shift it over and back, and over my nose and cheeks i have small light freckles, bridging over the lenght of my nose and mid way by my eyes on my cheeks. Our tribe is small, with only a few families who we share the road with, making up to 23 people, men, women and children, and we all are part of one big family, even if we do not share blood. During the first moments a child learns to walk and talk, they are introduced into the trades of our tribe, the shepherds, the workhand and the weavers, who make most fabric works of our tribe, using the wool of the sheep to make beautiful patterns, which we sell on the markets of the city we visit. My tribe is sedentary, we do not stay too long in one place, always on the trail of yellow sand. It's not bad, but i have always dreamt of seeing the world beyond the dunes, but staying with the tribe is something every child is thought since birth. But among the people of my tribe, i was given a gift.. The power to weave not wool, but rock. This ability is not something i was aware of until my 16th birthday, when one of the sheep my father asked me to take care off wander farther from the flock, and as i followed it up a rocky trail of a mountain, and as i was out of too far away from where the animal stood, with the thought of the rock cumbling so i could reach, with both hands placed on the cold stone, the mountain side shook, and it was too late to realize i had caused it to crumble, throwing debry ontop of me. Fortunately, i was rescued by a hunter, who took me back to my tribe. And since then, i have not told anyone about what really happened, nor what i did, with the fear of being outcasted as a danger for my people, and my family. Now on my 18th birthday, our tribe has made its way into one of the major cities if Kazeria, a place with traveling merchants like us who filled the streets with goods from all over the world, and a city which was visited by travelers from every inch of the land of Veloria. We settled one of our carriges which stored our weaving cloths and apparel by the main square, while the rest of the tribe stayed out the walls of the town. It was only me and my father, offering our goods to all the travels that passed by. \n\nI want this to be a long term story driven rp preferably over on discord, filled with life and a plot that keeps both of us entertained, with of romance and story of how we both came to know eachother. \nYour character can be whatever you want! A traveler from far away, a strong warrior, a scholar studying the ways of magic, a commoner out to make a living, a memeber of my tribe, a drunken patron, you choose! And if you have something you would like to add or ask about, please do tell! I am more than happy to answer any questions you may have.",

I have a few things to go into so that we're on the same page. Dont expect me to just set up the scene on my own. I wanna make a plot with you together. Do not expect me to send pictures of myself to you, I do not want pictures from you either. Please be descriptive. I roleplay for STORY not to help you get off. Please have good punctuation. Please understand that I have school and work so I will text when I can. I love a dirty roleplay but without story,I won't do it. I'm not into just having sex the whole time. I prefer to make characters bio's and such so please be prepared. Before we roleplay I would like to discuss things about the plot,more so a scenario rather than just Roles. i am a submissive so i lean towards submissive roles. I'm not into fxf but I enjoy fxm and mxm. Though, I dont prefer female Dom's. Please be realistic when it comes to characters and story. I'm not into incest Or scat. Please contribute to the story.

If you want to do MxF pairings, I\u2019ll need a lot of convincing! (I can play males :P)\n\nI\u2019d be a lot more comfortable if my partner was 21+ (as I\u2019m around that age). \n\nIf you\u2019re interested, please feel free to shoot me a message ^^ Have a nice day!",

On discord, I have created a server with some basic characters and some basic plot lines. If interested, you will join the discord and pick a character from the available list of characters. These range from rulers of lands to people trying to start a rebellion. This is a living role play, so it will change based off of what we write collectively.   \n\n\nThis might seem a bit out there but I was thinking it would be fun to give it a try. I am asking for 18+ as I intend there to be mature themes to it. I was hoping to get a good mix of people who enjoy writing. The idea is we would get a few people and start creating the stories together and craft the world as we see fit.   \n\n\nWould love to hear your suggestions. If interested, message me with your age, writing style, and discord!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you!!",

The kind of partner I'm hoping to find is someone willing to communicate, discuss, throw their own creative ideas at me and express their thoughts and opinions honestly without resorting to ghosting if the RP isn't to their liking. I am also looking for the kind of partner, that loves to befriend the person they're writing with as well. If I have no connections to the person I'm writing with -- What does it matter? If this is sounding like you, feel free to keep reading. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Roleplay.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs a writer, I love to GM roleplays for people. I like taking people's characters and introducing them to my world and the characters, locations, etc it has to offer. The world itself is a cyberpunk, science-fiction, Mass Effect-like place to have varying storylines depending on the location and type of character/race that you choose. All information on the world, the races and classes you can play, as well as the skills/perks you'll be able to obtain are in a google doc. The RP itself would take place over Discord, as it is where I prefer to write. But your character sheet and information will be held in a google doc. The RP will be using a Fallout-like system for skills, perks and bonuses. I like to get very detailed with my roleplays, so be ready for lots of that as well. If this sounds interesting so far, please take a moment to send me a DM detailing your age, availability, why you're interested, and then I can send you the google doc to read on the world. If you're still interested by then, we can begin the character creation process. I should also be sure to tell you now that the RP itself will have darker tones depending on the locations chosen, and material intended for 18+ writers that don't shy away from sex, violence or the brutality of harsh living conditions. But again, it depends on the area you've decided to begin in. The stories in this RP can range from living in drug and gang-riddled slums, to living on luxurious and peaceful space stations. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you've read both these paragraphs fully, thank you. I look forward to reading your messages.",

My true creative passion is to build my own worlds, with vast histories, rich ecologies, and functioning economies, and then letting others explore them, allowing the obstacles they provide me to enrich the settings I've made. Together, we'll build a new story in my world, post by post, with your character as the protagonist. Due to the ever-shifting sands of the wasteland that is the real world, it's been some time since I've been able to do this and so I have lost contact with all of my former creative partners. I'm here to find new ones.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel no need to over-complicate or embellish the rest of this post. I'll have no issue setting to rest the doubts of even the most demanding role-play partners, so here's what I'm looking for and here's what I have to offer.\n\n**Requirements**\n\n* Any age is fine, but 18+ is preferred. All of my content is tailored to each partner's wishes, and I've no issue factoring maturity into that.\n* You should be comfortable with writing multiple paragraphs with each post. There won't always be a need for that much content in a post, and that's fine, but it should be the norm.\n* Bring an OC or be prepared to build one that fits whichever setting you'll be playing within. Even in my *rare* fandom role-plays, I much prefer my role-play partners to play as an OC.\n\n**Current Genres**\n\n* Fantasy - Low/Dark/Epic\n* Historical - Classical/Medieval/19th Century/20th Century/Alternate History\n* Sci-Fi - Hard/Soft/Space Opera/Cyberpunk/Steampunk/Post-Apocalyptic/Zombie/Superhero\n* Crime\n* Supernatural\n\n**Contact**\n\nSo, if you're interested, just send me a message or start a chat with me. Tell me about yourself, the genres and themes you'd like, as well as any possible OCs you might already have or would like to build. You can ask me any questions and we'll sort out the details there.",

I have a couple of good plots I would like to try out if anyone is interested. If you have a plot that you would wanna try out I am open to that. I believe that when rping is something two people should be able to enjoy together so I\u2019m open to a lot of stuff. I wanted to combine genre of cyberpunk but give it a small twist to it. I have a few plot ideas I would like to mess with. \n\nThis is something different from the game Itself. This takes place in a Neo Tokyo  was thinking about a drug which would boost a person's rage; a kind of \"berserk drug\". The drug would make people feel great and invincible- increasing their violent tendencies. This would spread like wildfire in society, my character who is merc who was once with the syndicate but cut his ties with them.He now takes odd jobs around neo Tokyo while bounty hunting. (Your character) would be what oracle is to batman. Being able to scan areas for him and helping him get through certain. Obstacles with hacking. As for the plot I wanted to base it on the everyday life of bounty hunting and taking jobs from crime bosses and stuff of that caliber. I also wanna create lore around this story and focus on character back stories and stuff like that: if you are interested please dm me.\n\nWARNING: if you do choose to dm me and want to partake in this rp please be serious and committed to it. I\u2019m starting to get tired of people wanting to do this rp then disappear and ghost me... I need a serious partner that is willing to expand this rp and enjoy writing a story for it.\n\nPS: this is a longterm to. Ideas of any kind that will help keep the rp moving and make the story incredible. I have a lot of ideas and characters I wanna add into this.",

I am talking about taking a sequence in a roleplay that is already intense and suspense and extending it in a way that purposely creates melodrama and a heightened sense of detail so yes, you could say it's a bit absurd or silly.   \n\n\nIt is a cheap thrill that I find very interesting and would like to explore more so if you are interested in experimental writing, surrealism, or just generally weird and dreamlike stories this might be a chance for you to try some things. I think it works great in action/drama-focused environments but goes just as good with psychological plots, sci-fi, or fantasy settings with interesting magic and powers or could even be used in a tamer fluffier setting as a gimmick. DM me on here if you're interested and we can talk more about it on Discord! Thanks!",

            "selftext": "Hello all, it's been a while since I've been able to post. I blame my college schedule for that, in all honesty. But I'm back, and I'm ready to roleplay, and I would very much love to get back into the swing of things. Before I begin about my ideas, here's what you should know about me:\n\n* I am, of course, 18+\n* I am in college, as I stated before, and once more, my schedule can become incredibly busy.\n* I can write anywhere from several sentences to full page long, multi-paragraph responses. It all depends on what you prefer.\n\nI had two ideas for tonight, both of which are tried and true are seem to be well-liked: One Piece and Corruption of Champions 2. I love both to bits, even if the former is weird, so I'll get down to the juicy information.\n\nOne Piece, one of the longest-running anime, and with good reason. I love the world it sets up, and I believe it gives ample opportunity to change the story to how we see fit. I had several base \"ideas\" for the world swirling around this one, which happen to be:\n\n1. You are a pirate yourself, not replacing any of the Straw Hat members, but instead gathering a crew of your own and maybe even contesting them for the title of \"King of the Pirates.\"\n2. You replace Luffy with your own character. And now you, in Luffy's place, go about and go on their adventures, seeing the sights and exploring the Grand Line with the original team.\n3. Similar to the above, but instead you take control of Luffy, either gender-swapped or not, and go about reliving the adventure that One Piece brought about.\n\nCorruption of Champions 2, a work in progress game that I've come to enjoy greatly. The game itself sets up an easy base world to start in, along with starting quests and characters. Of course, I would take... artistic liberty with some of them, adding new quests, changing what they're capable of doing, but otherwise, I would like to leave them relatively untouched.  For the rest of the roleplay, well, I would be more than fine with having an open discussion about what we could do with it and its characters! There isn't much to say here, because I believe it's best to discuss these things in private.\n\nI hope to see all of you soon! Please pm me if you're interested!",

Canon compliant or au I don't mind either way. I can play either one but have more experience as Gabe.  \n  \nI could also be persuaded to play as Hanzo or Genji to your McCree!  \n  \nI expect decent grammar, few paras per post, and third person text.
