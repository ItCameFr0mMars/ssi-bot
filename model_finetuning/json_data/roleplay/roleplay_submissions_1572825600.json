I enjoy a deep story with dynamic characters. Nothing is worse than a stagnant story.\u00a0\n\nI tend to write multiple characters to help storyline, and I am open to almost anything, so don't hesitate to throw anything my way. I write in third person and prefer to use Discord, as it is much easier to have servers to separate everything out.\n\nI also like to make friends when I roleplay, talk about the characters or what's happening in the story or funny little side comments and AUs.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m keeping this short, so that we can discuss more once we start talking.\n\nIf you are interested or have any ideas, feel free to run them by me, I will respond to any all all messages.\u00a0\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this, Ilook forward to hearing from you.",

            "selftext": "Hello, this is an idea I\u2019ve had for some time and would love to implement into a Roleplay. This is only one prompt, and honestly it can go a few ways, the vampire can be either character etc. \n\nVampires are real, they live amongst humans and live day to day lives just as anyone else would. The main difference is that Vampires do not bite and suck ones blood, instead, they live off the life energy of humans. Simple contact to one\u2019s body and the will to do it will cause a humans life force, or energy to siphon to the Vampire. Usually it wouldn\u2019t cause death, just extreme tiredness and exhaustion setting in after the Vampire was done, only those who wanted to kill generally did. This is where we find Xavier, a vampire, one with a backstory he prefers to hide from the world. Like most Vampires, he has astonishing eyes, a golden hue to them that seem to shine and captivate those who would get caught within their gaze. Something had been troubling him for some time, a scent, one he couldn\u2019t get rid of or avoid no matter how hard he tried. He had unwillingly and unknowingly found his Singer and found himself drawn to her causing a worry and possible addiction if he ever touched her. \n\nWhat will happen when one thing leads to another and the two bump into one another leading to Xavier trying to curb his desire for more and feelings growing faster than he ever anticipated.\n\nThank you for reading, and if you made it this far, kudos to you. I would love to create an awesome ecperfience and story with a literate and detailed partner. Feel free to message me if you are interested. If I do not get back to you right away I apologize!\n\nThanks,\nDuke",

I'm a retired car thief that's been in hiding ever since you almost took me down.\n\nZombie apocalypse: Don't have a scene for this but would love to create one together. \n\nDragon rider: You come from long line of dragon hunters. One day while on a hunting trip your father and his men a storm knocks you off the ship and into the ocean. You awake in a mysterious land inhabited entirely by dragons. While exploring the new place you stumble upon my cabin.\n\nBartender: I walked in on my girlfriend and bestfriend together in bed. We'd been dating for 5 years so this was a major blow. I leave and immediately go straight to the bar to drown out my sorrows. I sit at the bar and see you asking you for a drink.\n\nBig party small town: So the basic idea for my rp is your from the city and while passing through a small town in Tennessee you and the boy with you (could be son or little brother no preference.) You stop at the local store and see me and a few people putting flyers up for the annual \"redneck rave.\" You ask what it is and after i explain it your son or brother begs you to go and we pick up from there.\n\nSocial media: We're both big on social media from different aspects. One of us invites the other onto their podcast and we talk eventually getting to know each other and become friends and maybe more.\n\nYoutuber house: You're the owner and CEO of an esports team. You've had a team house for a abour a year and are ready to expand. You decide to have a content house you do your research and invite me to join and be the first streamer/content creator to live in the house with you. Eventually you'll invite others to join.\n\nWhere you come from: We grew up in the same small town in Georgia and were best friends. You moved to California when your dad got an amazing job and you've been living the wealthy life ever since. One day when you come home from shopping with your other rich friends your mom and dad tell you're all going back to Georgia for an extended visit and you couldn't be more upset. \n\nThe new guy: I wasn't the most popular guy at my old school and everyone picked on me. I embarrassed myself one day to the point of needing to get out. After meeting a guy that went through the same situation i reinvented myself as a cool jock type and transferred to your school. \n\nCriminal enterprise: Your mom and my mom were bestfriends. She helped pay for you mom's medicine when she was sick. When your mom finally passed you came to live with us. When you get here you realize we're one of the country's most successful crime families. \n\nSingle parent: This is one is pretty straight forward. We can discuss different options in PM.\n\nUnexpected pregnancy: We met at a party and got drunk and hooked up. We didn't talk afterwards until you called me telling me your pregnant. \n\nSmall town living: you were always a good respectable person. You always saw the good in people but sometimes that wasn't necessarily a good thing. You dated a guy that seemed fine to everyone except behind closed doors he was extremely abusive. When you came home one day with a broken nose and a black eye your parents knew they needed to do something. They decided to send you to live with your aunt to hopefully hide you from him.\u00a0 You were relieved to be away from hom finally. When you get to your aunt's farm you see me working out in the fields. \n\nSuperpower: Ever since i was 5 i knew i was different but no one ever told me why. I came from a long line of shapeshifters unfortunately that's usually what got them killed. Both my dad and uncle were shifters but they mysteriously died when i was 5. My mother started to see the signs of me becoming one the animal print started to show on my body and she knew she couldn't go through with it. When i was 6 she turned me over to foster care and disappeared. Now I'm 22 and using my gift for more personal gain. Rather it be changing into a horse betting on myself at the local track or a championship caliber race dog. You've been passed a file on me to try and bring me in to try and stop a criminal mastermind from trying the world into chaos. \n\nReconnect: I've been bestfriends with your older brother since we were in kindergarten. We're both sophomores in college and play football for the school. You and me always had a connection but never acted on it. Now it's your brother's wedding and we meet up when you see my smoking out by my truck.",

            "selftext": " *The  new township had a few dozen families, homes for each, a windmill for  milling grain, a sawmill and lumber yard for processing the rich wood of  the forest that surrounds, a few common wells for water, a town hall, a  small shrine to Lady Bel, the Sun Goddess, and other communal and  private buildings for processing food and goods. It is far from becoming  a city and the local lord is further away than the nearest large town.  Trade goods come occasionally in exchange for the high quality lumber,  and merchants to sell their wares. However, the woods have always been a  place of mystery, rumor, and fear. The people that work them whisper of  spirits watching the lumberers, that the woods themselves have a life  and an intelligence that rues their work against the trees. The people  do not feel safe.*\n\n*But* she *is  here to belay those fears. She is a Paladin of Lady Bel, the Goddess of  Light, Healing, and Justice. Trained to wield steel and the magic of  the Lady of Light, she is here to bring the law of civilization to the  frontier town, to tend Lady Bel's shrine, and to put to rest any notions  of evil spirits...or put such spirits to rest themselves.*\n\n*Chief  among the rumors is that of a spirit moving through the village at  night, wandering around, visiting the farm animals and the wells,  floating about, sometimes just watching. The lady Paladin will discover  this spirit to be one like her...a Priest of Lord Sin, the Master of the  Moon, a god of Mystery, Magic, Secrets, but primarily known as the  Dual-Natured God; a guide for those lost in the dark, and an avenger for  the wronged. What this young man wants is not clear, but the two of  them shall become painfully entwined together.*\n\nI  would like to do a roleplay steeped in emotion and a conflicted romance  between the Moon Priest and the Sun Paladin. Whether from internal or  external threats, I would like conflict and pain between them as they  struggle with their emotions. I want to paint a rich and lush world with  lots of descriptors and feeling. We can fill in more details and more  about the characters before we start. I hope we can create something  deep and filled with feeling together. If you have any questions, let me  know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the past I've tried to weave grand plots and mysterious stories into my roleplays, but I'm going to try for a simplier approach this time. Unless you have a plot idea, which I am open to, I willing to simply focus on the characters and their interactions to begin with, to build some humanity and life in the characters.",

            "selftext": "Hi! I\u2019m on the search for a writing partner for plot heavy, character driven roleplay with a good sprinkling of smut and romance throughout. I don\u2019t have a particular plot in mind right now and I much prefer to build upon prompts with a partner. So please come to me with your favourite tropes, genres and any plot cravings you might have! \n\n\nWhat I\u2019m looking for:\n\n- Third Person, past tense.\n\n- MxM pairings, IRL gender is unimportant.\n\n- Mature and communicative roleplayers. Please mention your age when messaging me.\n\n- Original characters in modern original settings. I\u2019m open to many different genres but historical and high fantasy rps just don\u2019t do it for me unfortunately.\n\n- Realistic face claims or descriptions. No anime or drawn character references please.\n\n- Detailed multi-paragraph responses. I typically write between 3-6 paragraphs on average, sometimes more depending on the scene.\n\n- Someone chill about response times. Sometimes it might be daily, other times I might only be able to respond a couple of times a week.\n\n- Someone who enjoys plotting, worldbuilding and chatting ooc.\n\n- Someone that doesn\u2019t shy away from gritty, angsty or nsfw themes. I enjoy dark themes and I don\u2019t fade to black, so please be upfront about your limits and triggers.\n\n- Someone that enjoys versatility. I kindly ask you not to contact me if you feel you can only ever write your characters taking on a certain role in the bedroom. When cornered into one role things can get stale real fast and I will not double simply for the sake of \u2018fairness\u2019. None of that \u2018I\u2019ll write x for you if you write y\u2019. We should be equally invested in the roleplay otherwise the effort is imbalanced.\n\n- Well thought out replies. I prefer to plot 1x1 long term rather than lots of shorter stints with many different partners, so I\u2019m going to be a little picky here as I\u2019m looking to find someone I click with. Because of this I\u2019m not likely to answer low effort responses like \u2018Hey, wanna RP?\u2019 Give me something to latch onto and get me excited to write with you.\n\nIf you\u2019ve read all this and think we might be compatible, please shoot me a message with some details about yourself such as your age, your limits, preferences etc and any ideas or cravings you may have. :)",

I was about ready to give up and then she came along and gave me hope! So here I am, being greedy AF and looking for a few more long term partners.  \n\n\nI'm 26 years old and have been roleplaying for ... god, idk 13-15 years? lol Not that experience matters that much. I consider myself semi-lit to literate. My replies vary in length depending on the story and what is currently going on. I usually mirror my partner's reply length but never write less than 1-2 paragraphs.   \n\n\nNot going to lie, I love roleplaying with faceclaims. (no cartoon or anime). I like sending gifs and images and music that inspires the muse and reminds me of our characters. I'm looking for someone who'll not only be a roleplay partner but a friend.   \n\n\nCurrently, I have this very specific random craving for a certain romance/drama plotline but would love to hear any and all ideas you may want to roleplay!  \nI can do male and females (usually prefer fxf or mxf pairings). I write in third person only :,) and don't mind NSFW content!  \n\n\nHit me up!",

I can do modern or medieval, but no sci-fi, no end of the world, no futuristic, no dragons and mermaids and ogres. I like romance, lots of drama, maybe some action? or maybe adventure? Depends on the roleplay! I am open to playing all kinds of characters! (But no FxF) I can play male, female, gay, straight... You name it. There is going to be some stuff I won't do, but just ask and I'll let you know!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't currently have any ideas to post on here because I don't want people to think that it's all I'll do! I like roleplaying a lot of different things and I'd love to hear your ideas, or perhaps we could just come up with something together, the old fashioned way!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI like to write as much as I can, but it doesn't always have to be something ten posts long. Haha. That being said, I'm not going to roleplay with someone who only gives me about three lines of text for a response. I can cross the 2000 character limit a good majority of the time. Yes, I understand that sometimes the characters are just talking so the responses won't be as long, but I would expect them to pick up length as we moved on to other scenes instead of staying at dialogue length. If we're having an intense scene, I expect it to be pretty lengthy with all of the detail needed to make it FANTASTIC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNO TEXT TALK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHope to talk to you soon! (And please leave your Discord tag in your message! It'll make it easy on me since I just can't hold good conversations on Reddit. XD) I'm in eastern time! If that matters. XD",

I'm female, but I don't care if you are male or female or what sex or orientation you want to play; I am comfortable playing men, women, different orientations, and various ages.  The important thing is that if there's romance, it's a long, slow burn over weeks or months.  I'm looking for a writer who really enjoys writing for its own sake, for the joy of feeling out the plot and characters and descriptively exploring the setting.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis usually leads to longer posts, but the important thing here is quality.  I'm not looking for uniform word count, but rather word count that makes sense for the content.  If it's your turn to describe the characters walking over a hill and seeing a new location, that should reasonably take a lot more words than a simple response to a yes or no question.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**I have many writing samples for you.  Please have at least one to share in the genre in which you wish to write.  I look forward to hearing from you!**",

I enjoy a deep story with dynamic characters, nothing is worse that a boring storyline.\n\nI play multiple side characters and I am open to almost any roles do don\u2019t hesitate to throw them at me. I write in third person and prefer to use KIK but other platforms are fine too.\n\nApart from just being roleplay partners I love to become friends also, adding side comments and or what\u2019s happening in the story. \n\nIf you are interested or have any ideas feel free to run then by me, I will respond to all messages.\n\nThanks for taking time read this, looking forward to hearing from you!",

I enjoy romance and drama storylines with buildup to certain parts of the story. (I also am getting a hankering for some fantasy ex.

            "selftext": "Hey, guys. I posted a few months ago looking for a long time rp partner. In the end, everything got slimmed down to one person. She's an amazing writer, but life sucks and we can't rp anymore. Normally I'd just call it quits, too, but not only have I enjoyed having writing to de-stress me from daily life... but our roleplay literally got me to start drawing again. The other day I even took the leap and started getting ready to do commissions! Like, I giant leap. So many giant leaps. That's huge for me! However, most of my life my writing was always paired with my drawing. I can't draw if I'm not writing. I'm not ready to let drawing go... So, it's time to search for a new rp partner. I'm only looking for one or two!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce again, I'm going to be posting my old ad because why mess with a good thing? Minor editing involved to bring attention to things that people in the past overlooked.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   \n\nI'm looking for a long term roleplay partner. I'm 26 years old and I've been roleplaying for 13 years. I'm looking for someone close to my age, but at least over 20, since the most fun rps have mature themes. When I have a favorite rp partner, I stick to them for months to years--only a falling out in friendship stops the story.\n\nAbout me:\n\n\u00b7 I've either done the thing or seen the thing done, so pretty much nothing in rp bothers me. Bring on the suggestive and the gory!\n\n\u00b7 I am an impulsive writer, I don't make my characters do things, I write what they want to do\u2014so super detail planning things is wasted effort because 50/50 chance they will sabotage all plans. On the bright side, it makes them more realistic.\n\n\u00b7 **I prefer making** ***male*** **characters** since that's what I'm used to, but I can make female characters if I'm properly inspired. I also *prefer* m/m, but I'm okay with m/f for side characters. I have never done f/f before so I have no opinion on it except I do not want it as the main character focus.\n\n\u00b7 I can make characters so fast it's almost embarrassing. The more characters in an rp, the better!\n\n\u00b7 I write multi-para to novella (1.5k to 3k+ words || 4 or more chunky paragraphs). The more inspired I am, the more I write--but I write less than 1k (0.7 - 0.8) if there is nothing going on. I will not respond if I'm bored. If I'm bored and I don't expect to get over it, I'll let you know. **I am okay with my rp partner not mirroring me**, but if you write less than 600 words I will get bored fast, no matter how great your writing is. *If meeting the word count is a problem, please do not message me!* I am sure you\u2019re a wonderful writer, I promise it\u2019s okay to write what you\u2019re comfortable with, however it\u2019s very upsetting on both of us if I send a starter and you instantly go \u201cI can\u2019t write that much\u201d and leave, or we spend a lot of time plotting only for you to say that. There\u2019s plenty of people who like to write small paragraphs out there, but I am not one of them. \n\n\u00b7 I write in 3rd person attached, with multiple POVs separated if I have more than one character in a scene and their POV is important/relevant.\n\n\u00b7 Genres: fantasy (including modern), supernatural, romance, slice of life/family (in moderation), action (**not** sparring), adventure, sci-fi, world building, apocalyptic, post-apocalyptic, and horror (sometimes)\n\n\u00b7 Super duper extremely literate! Jk, I make mistakes and don't proof read sometimes if I\u2019m rushing (like I\u2019m trying to send a post before clocking into work), but I have been in the game long enough to know what I'm doing and be somewhat picky about what I receive.\n\n\u00b7 I only use OCs, I *do not* Fandom RP and I *will not* Fandom RP.\n\n\u00b7 I prefer email but apparently google docs is a thing, so I\u2019ll do that, too. No roleplay on discord, the character limit is annoying. \n\n\u00b7 I respond daily, and I will tell you if I can't respond on one day (like if I have a date or something idk.). I can get more than one reply out in a day if I\u2019m not busy.\n\n\u00b7 None of my characters are human. I **hate** making human characters, I will not do it! Some of my older characters are OP (because of stuff and things in the RL past), if rping with them happens (which will always come with permission from you), fighting them is not allowed because that's kinda not fair. I hate sparring period, but still.\n\nWhat I'm looking for in you!:\n\n\u00b7 20+, and okay with **super** mature themes. (Like, seriously, if you have triggers I'm probably not a good fit, because some things that can trigger people at the very least will be mentioned if it's part of a character's backstory. I don't wanna do that to you.)\n\n\u00b7 Have a firm grasp on grammar, and able to write more than 600 words. (&lt;--Looking for, but I won't fight you if you can't! There's just a *giant* disclaimer that I may not be able to continue the rp.)\n\n\u00b7 Able to juggle more than one character. (I'm sorry, but you're going to get overwhelmed if you have one character and I have, like five. Also, I've done this imbalanced thing before and it's also really boring for me... No one watches tv or reads a book with only one character present the entire time, you know?)\n\n\u00b7 I'd love it if you preferred m/m, **but it's not mandatory**. M/m can be a side character relationship, but you have to definitely be comfortable with it, because it\u2019s not optional. \n\n\u00b7 Able to respond daily. I get that life happens, as long as you let me know if you need to skip a day or so that\u2019s okay! But, generally, I\u2019m not a once a week or twice a week kind of roleplayer. I\u2019ll lose interest in the rp.\n\n\u00b7 Have a healthy (or unhealthy, who am I to judge) obsession with shipping like me. Seriously, I\u2019ll wanna pair everyone together haha.\n\n\u00b7 Able to write in 3rd person and juggle multiple povs.\n\n\u00b7 Be a really cool person! Or a lame person, idk. I\u2019m a lame nerd.\n\nI do not have \"rl\" faceclaims... I like to draw, so if I want to see my character I'll draw them. But I was a weeb, so my style is pretty anime-ish, apparently some people don't like that? I'm not really interested in changing that about me. Sometimes I'll go on a search if there's a specific outfit I can't describe properly, but that's it. Idc if you use rl people as faceclaims, I just won't want to do it.\n\nPlease don't message me questioning why I haven't done f/f.... people did that last time. :(\n\nIF YOU READ ALL OF THIS THANK YOU! GO OUT AND BUY YOURSELF A COOKIE, YOU EARNED IT!\n\nPs: I understand if this makes me sound kinda rude and picky but I promise I am nice! But I also don\u2019t want your time wasted or mine.",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone! I have been roleplaying for a while now and I love being able to come up with various plots and characters with different people. When it comes to genres, I prefer fantasy, medieval, and historical categories. I LOVE romance and drama! \n\nI also love supernatural and dark themes, the less ordinary, the better! As for slice of life roleplays.... I tend to enjoy them under specific circumstances. When it comes to smut, I\u2019m okay with it for the most part, as long as it is developed slowly and realistically, I do smut-based roleplays if they are creative and very detailed. \n\nMy style of writing is very detailed, though I must admit; I am not from an English speaking country, therefore I am prone to some minor grammatical errors. I expect 2-4 paragraphs when roleplaying. They don\u2019t have to be very long, but they do have to include imagery, and they have to be in third person.\n\nI love world building and rich character development, PM me or comment if you are interested :) \n\nOh! Also, there has been a certain scenario that I\u2019ve really been wanting to roleplay. It\u2019s based off of the Joker movie, and I was hoping for someone to be able to play The Joker (Arthur Fleck) in a romance and drama roleplay with my OC!",

            "selftext": "Hi. It's that time of year. Things get crazy and we need to find something to get out of the holiday mess. And well, here we are! Allow me to introduce myself.\n\nI'm Mel. I'm 28, I live in EST, and I work full time. I have a kiddo, and (surprised!) another one on the way. I work retail. This is all very stressful and I need an outlet. I've got about 16 years of roleplaying under my belt and I consider myself advanced literate, writing novella style posts. I have experience in most genres but prefer the dark and macabre themes. I try to post often, but sometimes I drown in work and real life. But I like to keep in contact so I'm not going to just drop you.\n\nThat said, don't ghost me. I wouldn't do it to you. So not cool.\n\nSo what am I looking for? Usually a partner 18+, though 21+ is preferred due to the nature of the beast. I have many prompt ideas but they've typically been deemed too dark and obscure, so I'd rather create together. Time zone is not a problem for me if we click.\n\nHave you made it this far? Wonderful! Let's talk about things I'd like to write. Here's a few genres, but they're by no means the limit!\n\nAnime: Sailor Moon, Dragon Ball, Hellsing, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, Zombie Land Saga.\n\nVideo Games: BioShock, Fallout, World of Warcraft, Diablo, Onmyoji.\n\nMisc: Victorian, Steampunk, High Fantasy, Gothic, Supernatural, Retro-Futuristic, Post-Apocalyptic.\n\nI'm only interested in writing through Discord. If you're still here and would like to plot together, send me a DM! I'll be more likely to respond if you tell me your favorite book rather than giving me a generic \"hi I'm interested.\" Looking forward to writing with you!",

We are first and foremost a mature community of 18+ literate roleplayers looking to add more quality writers to this world! We write anywhere from novella to a minimum of paragraph length, offer clean organised OOC chats, and a team of dedicated and responsive staff.\n\nEven though our lore is fairly extensive, it is split in a way to ease access for new characters in must-read and optional sections. We welcome original characters who are looking for a natural progression through Lush be it through learning magic, acquiring magical items or accessing high society in a moderated way.\n\nHere's the pitch : \"Lush, a magocracy established in the eye of what the council named 'The mist'. A complex, self-sufficient chain of guild-ruled mega districts. It floats amongst a dense fog, held by magically powered devices lining the city's edges. Since it is made of an agglomeration of different districts connected by large magical bridges, there isn't a direct way in, or out of it. Anyone that comes or leaves must be either summoned, or banished by a mage. The arcane arts play a major role in the life of nearly all of its inhabitants, and while tech in itself was never really let aside.. most innovations combine a certain amount of engineering, and spellcrafting. As a result, Lush is stuck in an era of its own, replacing most of today's convenience with magical means, yet dropping any significant tech past the medieval era in the process \\[...\\]\"\n\nIf you are interested, here's the invite link: [https://discord.gg/hQVRyZd](https://discord.gg/hQVRyZd)",

I have a couple of good plots I would like to try out if anyone is interested. If you have a plot that you would wanna try out I am open to that. I believe that when rping is something two people should be able to enjoy together so I\u2019m open to a lot of stuff. I wanted to combine genre of cyberpunk but give it a small twist to it. I have a few plot ideas I would like to mess with. \n\nThis is something different from the game Itself. This takes place in a Neo Tokyo  was thinking about a drug which would boost a person's rage; a kind of \"berserk drug\". The drug would make people feel great and invincible- increasing their violent tendencies. This would spread like wildfire in society, my character who is merc who was once with the syndicate but cut his ties with them.He now takes odd jobs around neo Tokyo while bounty hunting. (Your character) would be what oracle is to batman. Being able to scan areas for him and helping him get through certain. Obstacles with hacking. As for the plot I wanted to base it on the everyday life of bounty hunting and taking jobs from crime bosses and stuff of that caliber. I also wanna create lore around this story and focus on character back stories and stuff like that: if you are interested please dm me.\n\nWARNING: if you do choose to dm me and want to partake in this rp please be serious and committed to it. I\u2019m starting to get tired of people wanting to do this rp then disappear and ghost me... I need a serious partner that is willing to expand this rp and enjoy writing a story for it.\n\nPS: this is a longterm to. Ideas of any kind that will help keep the rp moving and make the story incredible. I have a lot of ideas and characters I wanna add into this.",

My character lives in a forest and then one day your character needed help from an animal attack and he saves/helps your character? Of course your character can shape shift to whatever you\u2019d like, even if it\u2019s also a wolf. This idea is one I would really like to do, but I\u2019m always open to changes.\n\n2. Slice of life. As common as it is, sometimes I have that itch where I\u2019d like to establish a slice of life role play. Including drama and all that. The characters could perhaps be coworkers or classmates? Maybe they can already be an established relationship with kids or no kids. This one is super vague and has a wide range of options, so we can discuss this further if we decide to select this one. \n\n3. Super human abilities. Every human born has one big or small attribute that makes them superhuman. Some have  telekinesis, super strength, are some examples so the options can be very wide. Perhaps our characters can be in a college where they learn to hone their special abilities. Our characters end up chatting and having a wonderful time and soon enough dating. This one can branch to almost anything, so we can brainstorm if this one is selected!\n\n4. I\u2019m open to your ideas, but fyi I don\u2019t have much knowledge on fandoms like how many people post about here do that\u2019s a no from me, dawg. \n\nNow again I\u2019m looking for someone long term, or short term if the replies are consistent. Perhaps until the role play ends or if life gets in the way. While I understand things happen, a bit of a heads up would be great. Nobody wants to be ghosted, so let\u2019s please be straight up. \n\nTL;DR: Discord only, prefer 3rd but can do 1st, ideas above, chatting outside role play is a must for me, and please don\u2019t ghost. \n\nThank you,\n\n\n\n\nRyan",

Sothis is some kind of entity that lives in your mind and speaks to you throughout the game, commenting on your actions. She forms a special kind of relationship with your character, but imo, it's not very well explored. What does Sothis think of the normal things Byleth does day to day? Do they have conversations? I know that if I had someone like Sothis in my mind, I couldn't imagine not having a very close relationship. \n\nFor this RP, I'm looking to play Sothis in a Fire Emblem RP, or RP some scenario where your character has someone in their mind through some means. Someone they could form a intimate relationship that would otherwise be impossible! Also, if you have any series that you'd want to try this concept in with canon characters, let me know! I have a special place in my heart for **RWBY** and **Va-11 Hall-A** especially. \n\n---\n\nSomething to note:\n\n**You should be 18+ and down for NSFW**: Frankly, I get bored without a NSFW component. Especially for a prompt like this where characters would be talking about intimate moments, I would LOVE to explore both the SFW and NSFW sides of this prompt. I love FxF relationship writing, but could be down for other combinations based on what you present me.\n\nIf you're interested in exploring this prompt with me, please reply with a general idea of the **fandom** you're interested in along with **characters**, unless you'd like to run with OCs, in which case try to give me some starting prompt to go off of. Try to put your **age/gender** in your subject line. \n\nThanks!",

I've had couple of roleplays in this setting that turned out really well, and I've had the incredible urge to try and replicate that success. So, simply put, I just need **18+ people**, male or female, who would be potentially interested in building up this world with me!   \n\n\nHere are some of my caveats:  \n\\-**18+** Like I stated above. This is mainly story based, but yes, occasional adult themes can pop up, so better to be safe than story.   \n\\-**Third-person only.** I don't hate first person, but this simply makes things smoother. This is usually not a big deal, but I know some people only like to write in first.   \n**-Competent writing.** This is probably the biggest point on here. Everyone has different levels of roleplaying, and I'm searching for the more nuanced way. At the same time, I'm flexible. As long as you can put together a coherent response, I'm most likely game.   \nIf you want to try it or simply find out some more information, PM me, and I can give you my Discord ID. Cheers!",

            "selftext": "*Arne sat on the dais in the front of the crowded hall and listened as the English priest prattled on. Despite the chilly autumn air, he sat shirtless, though dozens of silver rings covered his massive arms and swirling tattoos patterned his chest. The Viking Chief watched as the scrawny man raised the burning incense and asked God to bless this treaty, to bring peace, and to deliver the pagans into his Grace. When he was about to launch into another scripture reading, Arne held up is hand and said, in a firm voice, \u201cThat is enough, father. How is that you have only one God and yet you speak to him constantly? Do you not worry of being bothersome to him?\u201d The priest\u2019s face turned red and he opened his mouth to reply, but Arne\u2019s hand went to the hilt of his massive sword, turning it so the metal glistened in the afternoon sun. Instead the priest gave a sigh, and motioned for another clergyman to bring forth the treaty. \u201cHis Lordship Orfred will now sign the\u2026agreement.\u201d*\n\n*The eyes of the room turned to Orfred, the grizzled old Englishking. His face was pale enough to make him look ill, but his sickness was from the thought of the deal he was making. He was signing over the rights to all the lands of the north save for a modest portion of his own estate and the few monasteries in the oceanside cliffs. But what choice did he have? The Vikings had bested him at every turn, with three years of constant raids and pillaging, with famine and misery becoming the norm. And it was all because of Arne, that bear of a man who not only never seemed to falter in battle but also had the shrewdness and intelligence to keep his fractious tribes organized. Orfred\u2019s only choice was to capitulate now and pray for a miracle rather than continue toward total destruction. Hopefully he had already sown the seeds for such a miracle. Hopefully. He spat and stood, taking the quill from the priest.*\n\n*But before he could sign, the doors at the end of the hall burst open. Six wild looking Vikings pushed through the guards and made their way to the front. Tugged behind them were three men and one young woman bound in a line to a single rope. The woman was dressed like a peasant and kept her head low. \u201cJarl, we found a group of them soldiers heading south. They had a bunch of documents like that,\u201d the leader of the group said, pointing to the treaty. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t read it but we got the answers out of one of them quick enough. They were hoping to find allies to the south and were offering the same lands they are giving you now.\u201d Angry shouts erupted from the assembled Vikings, with men starting to shove each other for the chance to take Orfred\u2019s head. The king for his part turned to the Jarl, saying \u201cThis is not news\u2026this was before we agreed to negotiate between us. You cannot blame us for our previous actions during the war\u2026I have agreed to all of your demands and...\u201d*\n\n*Suddenly the young woman shouted, \u201cNo! Father\u2026you can\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry\u2026I know you told me to stay hidden but I can\u2019t and you can\u2019t and and\u2026\u201d she trailed off. There was a shocked stillness in the room. Arne turned to Orfred. \u201cYou never told me you had a daughter,\u201d he said, in a cool voice. \u201cPriest! You who knows all the prayers, you know how to make a marriage blessing too, yes?\u201d He drew his sword and cut the rope, freeing the girl from the other prisoners but leaving her still bound. He pulled her to the front of the room. \u201cWe will be married now, and then the king will proceed with signing the treaty.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cNo! That wasn\u2019t the deal!\u201d The old man seemed on the verge of tears. Arne raised an eyebrow at him, then turned to face the girl. His lips curled into a sly smile. \u201cThe deal has been altered\u201d.*\n\nHello, I\u2019m Maddie! I\u2019ll be role playing as the English King\u2019s daughter. I\u2019m looking for a partner to play Arne, the Viking Chief. I\u2019m looking for a literate partner who is 18+, and who can write 1-2, or more paragraphs in third person. I understand that at some point in the Roleplay, the length of responses he slightly shorter due to dialogue.\n\nIf you are interested,  message me and I\u2019ll give you my discord.",

So, I'm looking for a committed RP partner first and foremost and really at this point anything and everything else is mostly a bonus. \n\nMy craving for an RP centered around a world of Mechs seems undying at this point and namely something like the BATTLETECH or mech warrior universe and once again a bonus if you're familiar with with the fandom. Also I'd be more than happy to play an OC in those worlds.\n\nFrom political power plays to minor faction wars or corporate espionage, I'm open to discussing possibilities. I do however enjoy a good old mercenary story in all its cliche. I'd like my partner to play a female character and someone who can be a leader to the type of character that I play which is along the lines of the tech based individual who values information and, strategy and planning to that of brute force. Whatever the case, nothing is set in stone and we can always discuss this.\n\n\nThe world itself is cyberpunk inspired with a bit of mech added in, not a must but just an idea I really wanted to play with. Perhaps you've hired me or vice versa, or maybe we were part of a joint coalition of forces hired to fight against a small empire and perhaps we were setup to kill one another.\n\nI'm looking for a long term and dedicated partner, I write in 3rd and my replies are generally on the longer spectrum of 3-4 paragraphs and although I'm not asking you to constantly match mines, but to just have the common sensibility of what's an appropriate amount while holding on to literacy. I also understand that life happens and if you're busy, it's not a deal breaker if you're gone for a while, but a heads up would be great. I work full time too and things happen. I mostly respond once a day at most or twice a week at the least (probably more on the weekends) \n\nIf you're a stickler for quality, then you're more than welcome to ask for a sample of my previous works.\n\nI hope I didn't sound too stuck-up and I thank you for reading this far. When it comes to ideas and building lore (which I'd love to do with you) fire away and we can bounce it off one another and you'll find that I'm quite open. You can ask away about anything else if you'd like or just chat... I'm always up for OOC and getting to know new people.\n\nI'm 20+ and ideally I'm looking for someone around that (or older)  my writing doesn't shy away from violence or NSFW as long as my partner is up for it and we agree upon what is appropriate. Romance is as always optional.\n\nMy primary is discord, and if you have any questions just shoot one my way on Reddit or we can talk on discord too (I'm sure I missed a few points)  hope to hear from you all soon.\n\n-Maxwell",

There are some who are far more powerful than the others, and in an attempt to distinguish the practically useless from the elite, a king long ago made a decree. At the age of 15, everyone will be sorted into their class. There are five classes, ranging from lowest to highest:\n\nServborn: those with the lowest magical potential are put here, their common jobs are those that are seen as disgusting. Cleaning after horses, sanitary workers, janitorial services, that kind of thing.\n\nLowborn: those with slightly below average magical potential, these are your average workers, cashiers in stores, bakers, small buisness owners, low tier blacksmiths.\n\nHighborn: those with just above average magical potential, these are your managers and buisness owners, successful people who are well off. Usually they employ both lowborn and servborn for their dirty work.\n\nRoyalborn: those with advanced magical potential. These are your diplomats, your rulers, the important people. They usually become government officals, dignitaries and the like.\n\nDivineborn: those with nearly limitless magical potential. They are the most powerful people in recorded history, only ten of them being known. These are Kings, Gods, and even Enlightened.\n\n\nThere are several rules to the magic system, and they're rather simple:\n\n1.) You're born with one type of magic, that can never change. If your first moment of magic is summoning a ball of fire, then you will have fire for the rest of your life.\n\n2.) There are different types of magic, you will never master both your offensive and defensive magic unless you are Royalborn or Divineborn. Even then, it's rare.\n\n3.) There is more than just 'fire' and 'shock' magic. If you can think of it, there is probably a magic for it.\n\n4.) No one truly knows how magic potential is measured, aside from the king and those who measure it.\n\n\n\n\nThank you for taking the time to read all of this before any actual talk of roleplay begins. There are several characters that I have premade for myself, however I can make more if you don't like any of them. The roleplay will change dramatically between each and every partner, so I'll just send forth my characters and worry about a starter later.\n\n\nAidan Famia: Aidan was born with bright blue eyes and very noticable red hair.

He is a Royalborn.\n\nCedar Davees: Cedar was born with dark brown hair and piercing green eyes, and he specializes in defense magic. He can summon tree limbs to protect him and his allies, as well as heal at a decent pace. He is a Highborn.\n\nJordan Mkyle: Jordan was born with brown hair and blue eyes, specializing in defense magic however he much prefers his job as a fisherman. He uses his magic to pull fish out of the water. He is a Lowborn.\n\nCarver Aaric: Carver was born with blonde hair and silver eyes, snd specializes in attack magic. He can harness his magical power to increase his muscles to a certain degree, making his hard labor tasks much easier. He is a Servborn. \n\n\n\n\nI seriously want to thank anyone who got this far into the reading! Please, message me if you are interested. I really want to build up this world and the best way for me to do that is to put people into it.",

This is my first post on r/Roleplay, so let me extend a warm welcome to those that read this!  \nI'm looking for someone that doesn't mind my hectic work schedule, and would like to RP with me. This RP will be long term, and I'm mainly looking for someone that doesn't mind late replies.\n\n**A bit about me..**\n\n* I am 18+ and can send confirmation of that.\n* I'm a CNA and I work NOC/Night shifts (11pm-7am)\n* I am located in the EST time zone.\n* I am more than willing to RP with someone that is outside of my own time zone.\n* I am normally online between 5pm EST to 10pm EST on my work days.\n* On my off days, my time varies as I may be doing other things. I normally am online between 6pm EST to 6am EST.\n\n**What I am looking for..**\n\n* I am mainly looking for someone to do a Skyrim based RP with me!\n* You must be 18+ and I expect to receive confirmation of your age.\n* I am open to other ideas my partner may have, such as doing a freeform RP about a different thing (werewolves, D&amp;D based, vampires, modern, fantasy, etc., etc.)\n* I am a literate writer, meaning I normally type between seven sentences and twenty sentences. I try to match my partner's length when posting.\n* I am looking for a semi-literate to literate partner that is fluent in English.\n* The roleplay can take place on Discord OR Chatzy. Either one is fine with me.\n\n**About the Roleplay..**\n\n* You get first dibs on what you'd like to be! You get to make the shots on what race you'd like to play, the gender, and if you'd like to play as the Dragonborn, an OC, or a premade follower in the game.\n* You can choose to play as the Dragonborn, or you can be a self made character, or premade follower in the game.  \nI am a sucker for original characters, though, so keep that in mind!\n* I am partial to the following species, and I'll most likely play as a(n)..:   \nDunmer, Altmer, Khajiit (female only), Argonian (male only), or Bretan!\n* You can play as a male or female, though I will play as the opposite sex as you. \n* I am familiar with ALL factions! The only ones I'd need to brush up on are the \"College Of Winterhold\" and \"Dawnguard\" factions.\n* This means that, yes, you can choose to become a Vampire, Werewolf, or join into the non Supernatural factions!\n* The Roleplay itself will be long term!\n* Action, Adventure, Fantasy, and a slow-burn Romance will be the main genre of the Roleplay.\n\n***Dm/Pm me for more information!***",

The man(your character) sailed with men who called each other brother, but he was not one of them. They paid him well, because they knew he was fierce, and they feared what might happen if he joined their enemies.\n\nThey stalked like a poisonous cloud through the town, leaving gore and screaming in their wake. A little later, the men began to make an effort to protect their homes and their families, but they were nothing compared to the raiders. Where the Warlord went, carnage followed, and the other men did well to stay out of his wake, when the bloodlust was in him, he didn\u2019t differentiate between his prey and his \u2018allies.\u2019\n\nHe knew what he was searching for, and found it when the smoke was high in the sky and the lights of the fires had drowned out the sunrise. A large, fine house at the highest part of the city. There were guards, of course, and the man made quick work of them, even as one took out a small chunk of his left upper arm with the tip of a sword as he barreled into him with the strength of an ox.\n\nInside, he took a moment to listen to pounding footsteps coming from the floor above him, and to observe the decoration of the house. There was also a scent in the air that wafted through the sharp metallic of blood, flowering and feminine. A man stormed down the stairs and the man tore out his throat with his teeth. Bright red blood stained his mouth as he climbed the stairs, dripping down to the floor.\n\nHe found two large doors at the end of the hall. The scent of flowers was more concentrated there. He opened one door, swinging it open almost delicately. His eyes roved around the master bedroom, finding luxurious furniture and a row of perfume bottles on a vanity on the far wall.\n\n\u201cI know you here.\u201d He said, his words short and stunted, but menacing and thick with his Norse accent.\n\nHello, I\u2019m Maddie! I am looking for a partner that can play as the man, whilst I\u2019ll play the woman he will capture. I\u2019m looking for a literate partner who is 18+, and who can write 1-2, or more paragraphs in third person. I understand that at some point in the Roleplay, the length of responses he slightly shorter due to dialogue.\n\nIf you are interested,  message me and I\u2019ll give you my discord.",

Humanity had advanced Scientifically further then any other world by miles. It discovered a way to access these Crossroads and broke the chain which sealed the others off. Allowing those inside to enter and leave.\n\nHumanity entered these realms and offered the inhabitants inside a place to stay and various other things if they allowed them to safely examine them to find the source of what wonderful and almost fantasy like powers they had.

You don\u2019t have to be particularly good at your character or your character doesn\u2019t have to be recognised by anyone in the Roleplay!

We strongly respect all the styles of play and any preference of our fellow game masters, for this reason the model abstracts from the merit of any adventure and provides a purely narrative structure that is articulated in a beginning, a development and a conclusion. We believe that a structure of this type, guided and enriched with appropriate details, is the basis of a quality adventure that is pleasant, memorable and motivating for all our role players.\n\n## A little preview\n\n&gt;*3, 2, 1... You are in flight! You can still hear the helicopter blades moving away as you fall quickly into the void. Below you the clouds make room for the ruins of Caracas, the former capital of Venezuela. A sloping fortress occupies the scene predominantly, planted in the belly of a high mountain like a gigantic crystal spear.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*\"Hello, Will? Does your MTM also get hit?

I already have basically the whole story planned but changes will be made accordingly to your own ideas and character, we can discuss this a little more over discord or another place you might prefer over it.\n\nThis will be a one on one, and I use third person, like most people.\n\nLastly I just wanna close off with a small note, I'm not incredibly literate, but I do my best to output as much as I can, and when I'm in the flow I can output some pretty decent paragraphs, thank you all for reading and I hope to get some replies!",

Blackbeard killed him in the final battle, along with the rest of his crew who soon fell after. What followed was worse. Blackbeard became king of the pirates, and with his power, waged war on the Marines and the Revolutionary Army.The structure of the world crumbled as his regime grew. The war went on for years, long enough for Blackbeard to have children who rose up to power themselves, allowing Blackbeard to establish a monarchy.\n\nThe years went on, the government fading, and Blackbeard\u2019s regime becoming the government.The Revolutionaries were pounded into nothingness, and the marines are still fighting to this day, but on their last leg. The world is in a cursed era, where a corrupt pirate regime issues the bounties, a system more cursed than the world government rules.\n\nWhat will you do in this dark era?\n\n\\-A unique world and storyline that can change depending on the actions of the players within the world.\n\n\\-A balanced stat system with staff dedicated to make it so that everything stays fair, with the use of stats being discouraged unless it\u2019s an ooc conflict where two people can\u2019t come to an agreement.\n\n\\-You earn what you want through proper character development and rp. No roulettes, and no giveaways!\n\n\\-The ability to create your own fighting style to develop and add abilities to over time as you grow in power. You can make it unique to yourself, or you can add it to the public fighting style codex so other players can use it as well.\n\n\\-A unique progression system specifically made to work without training logs. We hate training logs. A lot.\n\n\\- 7 different professions to choose from, each with their own different and equally useful abilities as you level them up.\n\nFeel free to DM me with any questions you might have. Also, to the staff, if I have screwed up in some way with formatting and such, it was not my intention. Feel free to contact me and set me on the right path.

            "selftext": " eyo rp peoples. I write exclusively past tense 3rd person. I\u2019ve dabbled in other forms but I don\u2019t enjoy them as much. I tend to match my partner in writing amount but I am comfortable with multi para+. I like verbose rps just as must a 2-4 para ones. My intros tend to go longer. I don\u2019t mind errors as we all make them, but give your posts a skim before sending it. I like e-mail or G-docs or discord for the rp. For chatting with people discord is my preferred. I don't mind DMs but it is a lot slower.\n\nI don\u2019t mind any gender pairing, I don\u2019t mind doubling and always tend to play smaller characters as things develop. My female characters are probably a little stronger than my male ones but I don\u2019t have a strong preference to which I play. Any sort of romance is usually a secondary aspect to an rp for me, not the driving force. World, plot, development. I like these things more than trying to make characters love each other. With that said, I do enjoy romance and I\u2019m no limits, let me know how you deal with those scenes ahead of time so I know.\n\nFor time periods I\u2019ve don't often stray far from Modern, medieval, and varying degrees of future. I enjoy fantasy as much as I enjoy not having it. Slice of life, dystopia, utopia, post apocalyptic. I\u2019m pretty much open to any sort of theme to start building a plot and/or world just have more experience in the ones I listed.\n\nTo finish off I will say that I\u2019m capable of a response a day, maybe sometimes slower, or faster. But that is my usual turn around. 1 week is the longest I accept for partners. I don\u2019t personally use RL face claims, or RL people for character photos though I'm not entirely against others using them. Usually I do written description for characters, or use illustrations. I think that is about it. Well at the least it is all that comes to mind. DM any questions.",

            "selftext": "**Hey, everyone!**\n\nSo after watching the first Pirates of the Caribbean last week, I was in the mood to roleplay in a pirate setting. I mean the sword fights, the brash and arrogant villains, and the rum....it's enough to put a smile on *my* face. I mean imagine a world where you could to go on different adventures, fight different people, and collect gold for your work. Really *feel* like a pirate. Since no one was volunteering, I decided to make the barebones of it myself! Everything is mostly ready to go and now all I need are **active, invested people** who want to help me bring this world to life!  \n\n\n**What am I looking for?**  \n\\- **Storytellers:** Essentially, people who are competent writers and would be interested in light DMing occasionally. I'd most likely ask for a writing sample of some sort once we connected on Discord. I would say you have to be at least semi-active for this position.   \n\\-**Players:** People who also competent writers, but actually want to play in the pirate world themselves. You don't necessarily have to be active often as a player, and you can jump in when you feel like roleplaying. I don't have a preference in gender, guys and girls 18+ are welcome!  \n\n\n**What you'll be getting?**  \n\\-A plethora of information, including lore that is starting to expand.   \n\\-A tutorial adventure to test whether this world is a right fit for you.   \n\\-Rotating adventures that you can take your pirate on. They vary in length and difficulty and gold is earned for completing them.   \n\\-Factions (WIP)  \n\\-OOC/IC/NSFW designated locations for every type of roleplay.  \n\\-Updates on big changes  \n\n\nI think that's it from me! Things are still fairly new and will be updated as feedback is given. If any of that was interesting to you, PM me, and I can give you my Discord ID. Cheers!",

            "selftext": "Hi! I'm looking for someone to do an RP with in the Persona universe, which I've been itching for ever since info about Persona 5 Royal and Persona 5 Scramble started coming out. I'm pretty open to RPing with just about everyone, but I have a couple things to cover first:\n\n* I don't write long paragraphs. I know that's not ideal for some people, but I've *never* been able to write super long posts. At most, you might get two paragraphs out of me.\n\n* I will do MxF, and FxF. I don't write MxM, personally.\n\n* I will play a male or a female character, depending on what we decide on and who you decide to play.\n\n* OCs are okay, but I'm ideally looking for Canon characters in this circumstance. I don't have a problem with characters being a little OOC so long as it's not awful.\n\nSo, anyway, let's get to the main focus: characters I enjoy writing, and who I'd like to write them against. Bold are ones I'm most focused on.\n\n* **Joker/Ann**: I love this pairing and I could really play either one.\n\n* Joker/Haru\n\n* Joker/Makoto\n\n* **Yu/Rise**: Gotta show some love for Persona 4. Rise is a great character and, much like Joker/Ann, I could play either one.\n\n* Yu/Chie\n\n* Yosuke/Chie\n\n* **Makoto Yuki (P3 Protag)/Yukari**: Can you tell that I really like Lovers Arcana?\n\nFor the Persona 5 prompts, I imagine we could set it in numerous time periods: during the events of the game, between the original game and Scramble, and during the events of Scramble (just in case you weren't aware, Scramble *is* a sequel to the original game). For the other prompts, we can brainstorm a little and figure it out.\n\nIf you're interested, shoot me a PM. Otherwise, have a great day!",

I\u2019m up and open for anything, so hit me with any idea you have. My own favorites are Fantasy, Sci-Fi and modern, but again, open to everything!\n\nThree other things you need to know:\n\n- Romance as part of a story is fine, but it being the main focus is not my thing. Also, I exclusively RP FxF relationships and will always RP as F\n\n- I am a sucker for reference pics, so I please ask any GM to include visual references as much as possible. No limits to how much, but a ref pic for every relevant character is a must\n\n- I\u2019m only looking to RP on Kik (yeey, it\u2019s staying!), so make sure you have that when you PM me.\n\n- I\u2019m fairly active and online often, so bonus points if you are too!\n\nReally excited to hear your ideas, hope to hear from you soon!",

Sure, it was a cartoon series in the '80s. However, the 2002 series set up the potential for a serious world that on the level of Lord of the Rings. Furthermore, the movie was a bit cheesy. \n\nI love bad guys (lol). I am interested in role-playing/writing a story focusing on Skeletor &amp; Evil-Lyn. Yet, it's a bit of re-imagination with Evil-Lyn and a bit of storytelling that departs from \"canon\" or anything from the He-Man and the MOTU mythos. However, I'd love to have a story that has them as this power couple, well after Keldor becomes Skeletor. In other words, a romance tale. Set when they're established behind Snake Mountain. \n\nMy Evil-Lyn is a bit re-imagined and I think she would be a nice departure from how she has been depicted in other mediums. I think we can brainstorm a costume design for her too. Yet, I wanted to show you what I'm imagining here.\n\nI\u2019m trying to see if I can head somewhere to a place someone would be willing to help me with this.",

I\u2019m 20 years old, from the UK and I\u2019m an \u2018experienced\u2019 writer; ignoring my hiatus.\n\nReally, all I\u2019m looking for is a longterm roleplay partner who enjoys world building and descriptive, literate responses. I will do fandom based roleplay but much prefer OC.\n\nI will do almost any plot, so if you have something in mind that you\u2019re desperate to do then please drop me a message!\n\nI have kik at the minute and will probably download discord very soon.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you!",

The roleplay will definitely be dealing with high technology and maybe even aliens! \n\nWe can go over everything that will be in the story\u2026 we also can build a perfect sci-fi world! \nLazors and other futurist weapons can also be added\u2026 depending on the sci-fi. As for NSFW\u2026 if you are cool with it, then there may be a scene in which it happens.  \n\nAnd last but not least, rules, oh yeah, we all love them, but everything has to have rules to function properly. I request that you can provide more than two lines of text\u2026 or at least, try to keep with me in the writing process. Also, you must try to be here, if you can. If you bail from the roleplay\u2026 pls, let me know first. With that being said, you know what to do, and let's roleplay!",

Im quite imaginative and reasonably literate. I have alot of story ideas some dark others light hearted. Scifi to fantasy I'll try anything once. I like to communicate with my partners to know they likes so we get the best experience possible. I would prefer medium to long responses with good description, but in the case of dialogue I wont mind a short response. Any other questions I'd be happy to answer so DM me if you are interested let's have fun together hope to hear from you.",

            "selftext": "Hey, I\u2019m Luna, I am 19 years-old and have been roleplaying for around 6 years. I am passionate in the regards of writing, literature and media (movies, tv shows) overall and writing and singing has been my biggest creative outlet. I consider myself to be literate and I can handle most writing styles and lengths - however, I do very much prefer a partner who is competent with the English language and can write full sentences (I tend to do 1-3 paragraphs depending on the context of the response). As I mentioned in the title I prefer to use Kik and Discord, however, I am open to other platforms too.  I also prefer PLOT over SMUT - if you are coming for a purely smut roleplay, then this is not the roleplay for you. I only roleplay smut when the plot allows for it and it makes sense for it to happen for the plot/our relationship to evolve.\n\nI am very knowledgeable about both the MCU and the comic MU. It brings me great happiness to play out a plot with a partner who I get along with! With all of that said, I will list who I prefer to roleplay below in order of most liked to least.\n\nThis is who I prefer to play as in Marvel; Jean Grey, Rogue, Mystique, Scarlet Witch/Wanda Maximoff and Gamora.\n\nAlso, I am open to anyone playing ocs, or canon characters if that is what you prefer. Please don\u2019t be afraid to ask! (I\u2019m also open to playing oc characters against my canon characters)\n\nApart from all of that I am looking forwards to hearing from you all! Feel free to include any ideas you have for the rp! Send me a pm or comment down below and I will get back to you ASAP! (I am also open to starting a group roleplay if we get enough people interested and all participants agree, however, I am also completely fine to roleplaying 1-on-1.",

            "selftext": " \n\n(*Heya! Looking for partners interested in a SFW, Fandom Based roleplay!))*\n\n**Kingdom Hearts**, the lovely series from the great and confusing minds of *Disney* and *Square Enix*.\n\nA series I have been in love with, as long as I can recall. With the DLC: *Re:Mind*, for *Kingdom Hearts III,* the itch to write something within this fandom has return!Now, when it comes to the series, I have played all the games; from the very first, to the mobile App; though, for the App, I have not been as committed to it, as the other games- but I do watch lore videos on Youtube about the App's story.\n\nEvery other game I have played, and beat though! So, no worries of spoilers, when it comes to discussing. I will say, while on the topic of the games them selves, my favorite in terms of Story/character stuff is: *358/2 Days,* as I love the concepts of Nobodies and the Sea-Salt-Trio. However, the best game of the series, is still probably *Kingdom Hearts II.*\n\nWhen it comes to possible ideas for a story/plot for a Roleplay, I am more than open to bounce ideas back and forth. We could stick to a specific game's time frame, and the characters within, while adding our own little spin/head-canon to things. Completely go in an AU type route, that could go as far as possible away from the Action RPG style game it is, like some sort of School Au with the Organization Members. An AU with our favorite characters on some new Adventure, re-writing events within the series with new changes. And so much more.I have a few snippets of thoughts that I'll list here.\n\n* An AU, similar in style of Final Fantasy X-2, with the female characters on some adventure. So, Kairi, Aqua, Namine, and Xion. (And anyone else we could add into the mix, as well.)\n* Re-writing anything within the series; seen quite a number of videos of people wanting to re-write KHIII. While there are things I would change, that could be applied to anywhere in the series. Sorta like an AU time-line, or what not.\n* This is, as suggested above, some sort of School AU. Saw fan -art once of Sora and Riku in school uniforms and thought it looked cool! So, its an option; though, I might need more than just a school setting.\n* Going into the in between moments, the time when Ansem the Wise was still in Power, and Xehanort and the others that would become Organization XIII( Nobodies), were still under Ansem's teachings. Show the experiments they preformed, and what Ansem taught to them, and the eventual over-take of power, between Xehanort and Ansem.\n* A cross-over, with another game I am in love with; Persona 5!I love the mental image of Sora, Donald and Goofy working alongside Joker and some of the Thieves. (Or just Joker) It couldn't be that big of a stretch to assume a Persona 5 world exists within the Kingdom Heart's universe, right?\n* Or, any thought you may have! Feel free to throw them this way, and we can bounce them back and forth\\~\n\nOh, here's some stuff about myself:\n\n* I prefer third person, past tense, POV. As for Length of posts, that can be vary/be discussed. My general rule: enough to keep things moving, ya know?\n* Platforms of where to write? Also can be discussed in PM's (NOT REDDIT CHAT) here.\n* I live in EST, and work a part time job, so replies might vary throughout the day. IF I am unable to reply for a few days, A message will be sent, explaining so\\~\n* I typically stick to Canon characters, and prefer my partner do the same. I have no problem adding in our own quirks/head-canon to characters; though, OC's can be discussed. Just, know I usually want Canon.\n* Anything else? Feel free to ask!",

I've been following Hazbin Hotel's progress since the project was first announced, and let me tell you: I'm so happy to see it come to fruition! I'm so incredibly *proud* of Vivzie and her team!\n\nAnywho, gushing aside... I'd like to enlist a few willing souls to join me in a bit of collaborative writing! I prefer canon-verse roleplays, but I'll happily write an AU if you have something prepared! I write Alastor most of the time. Pairings-wise, I'm a fan of Alastor/Angel Dust and Alastor/Charlie. I just think some interesting things could come from the latter.\n\nI'm always down for NSFW, always down for some gore, always down for pretty much *anything*. No limits here, but I'll respect your limits if you have them! I only ask that you're not a minor. I do most of my writing on Discord and email, but Kik and Skype are acceptable mediums too! PM or comment for details. \n\nI write in third person, paragraph form. Typically three paragraphs at \\~300 words per response - unless my partner writes more, in which case I will gladly adapt. \n\nThanks for the read!",

The only sound outside of the muffled television in the background and her husband\u2019s light snores was the sound of ice against tumbler, slowly melting away and coalescing with the last few swigs of her whiskey. \n\nLouboutin heels and a midnight black Prada dress lay crumpled on the floor, cast aside the instant she stepped through the hotel room door in favor of a plush bathrobe and slippers. It had been a long day. In fact, the past year and a half had been filled with long days, but soon it would all be worth it.\n\nConstance Chu looked across the room at the TV and smirked, hand reaching for the remote to raise the volume as a disheveled Senator Kane walked up to the podium and cleared his throat. It looked like he was about to cry.\n\nPathetic.\n\n\u201cMy fellow Americans. It is with a heavy heart that I announce my withdrawal from the race for President of the United States.\u201d\n\nHer smile widened.\n\n\u201cAs many of you are aware, I have made an error in judgement. My actions have deeply hurt my constituents and my family, and for that I apologize.\u201d\n\nIt turned out that Senator Kane\u2019s conservative base didn\u2019t react too well when the god-fearing family man was found balls deep in his male intern.\n\n The man\u2019s proclivities were something of an open secret around Washington, but Ms. Chu was the first to take advantage of that dark mark. A couple grand missing from her campaign fund wouldn\u2019t raise any red flags - at least not immediately - but it meant the world to a young staffer two months behind on rent. \n\nIt was evil and dirty, but Constance was far from the only senator in Washington who would bend the rules to get what they wanted. Wheeling and dealing behind closed doors, selling the integrity of America to the highest bidder. It was all a game, and it was a game she was about to win.\n\n\u201cThough I now withdraw from my bid for presidency, I encourage my constituents to put their faith in Senator Chu. Together, we can build a better America!\u201d\n\nShe turned off the TV, set her glass on the table, and climbed into bed. And as she drifted off to sleep, her lips spread into a wicked smile.\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nHello! I hope you liked that little intro. As you can see, the plot is pretty open ended. My goal is to find a partner with which I can build a world and a roleplay around political intrigue. It\u2019s likely that this will require a decent amount of plotting as well as both of us playing multiple characters. You can play exclusively male characters if you choose, but I\u2019d prefer someone who can write for both genders. \n\nWho you play initially is up to you. Constance\u2019s husband? Her side piece? An ambitious reporter trying to uncover corruption in government? The opposing party\u2019s candidate? Be creative.\n\nI have marked this as NSFW because I do find some romance and sex can really spice things up - maybe even some violence? Who knows. We\u2019ll have to hash it out.\n\nThe intro I wrote is based on American politics, but if you\u2019d like we can also create a fictional modern system of our own design. (Please title your DM to me as Political RP so I know you\u2019ve read the entirety of my post)\n\nI\u2019m looking for someone with a decent amount of experience and who is comfortable writing advanced, novella style posts. I\u2019d preferably like to see an example of your writing before we get into things to see if we\u2019re a good match - can be any genre and doesn\u2019t have to mirror mine at all.\n\nTalk soon,\n\nEmma",

First, I'd like to go over the kind of partner I want, then I can get into the roleplays I'm looking for.   \n\n\nPartner:  \n\n\nFinding someone open-minded, willing to explore new territory, and typically roleplays female characters would be great. Someone who can also play mainly canon characters is also very important. While I'm okay with OC's, please keep in mind I'm mainly looking to do RPs with canon characters. Someone who is willing to talk, communicate and discuss ideas. Communication is key in these kinds of partnerships -- I don't tolerate ghosting and if either of us have a problem with one another or the RP, let's talk before you decide to block me and not say another word. I'm willing to talk it out if you are too, and I think we can all agree we hate being ghosted and have been ghosted multiple times by different people quite often. Just how it is. Someone 18+ would be great, because I like to explore NSFW themes like violence and smut. Someone as into action/violence, and romance/smut would be great as well! If this is sounding like you, or you think we may be compatible, please continue reading below for the RPs I'm looking for!  \n\n\nFandom:  \n\n\n\\*\\*\\* = Ones I really want to do. \n\n*Anime:* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Watamote.

I mainly use Discord! Thank you for reading, just shoot me a DM with some basic info about you, the fandoms we share, and why you're interested. I have many ideas for just about all of the fandoms listed. Hope to hear from someone!",

I don\u2019t remember much of the book other than that this woman named Veronika chose to take her own life. She wasn\u2019t exactly in excruciating emotional pain, but more just empty and saw no point in continuing her meaningless life. She wakes up in a mental hospital and is told she has only a few days left. In that mental hospital Veronika finds herself and her will to live again as she gets to know other inpatients and even falls in love with one. That's the plot in a nutshell, don\u2019t shoot me if I got it wrong. \n\n  \n Anyway, I am not looking to copy the whole plot. What\u2019s important is the theme. A person who finds his life so empty he is ready to end it finds another broken human being who struggles with his own mental health issues. Although the plot is rather dark, I\u2019m not looking for just angst. I actually find it to be full of hope as even in the book it is revealed in the end that Veronika was not going to die and the doctor lied to shock her into appreciating what she had. I also enjoy dark humor and I appreciate that in a partner too. We can change the setting btw, it doesn\u2019t have to be a mental hospital. They could meet through mutual friends, at work, in a bar\u2026 basically anywhere as long as we kept the basic idea. \n\n  \n I am fine with writing either character as long as they\u2019re both well developed and realistic. I won\u2019t write with anyone under the age of 21, sorry! Also, I am only looking for a mxm romance right now.",

I will list a few below but I am open to lots of ideas. I am looking for someone who plays a male character, writes 3rd person, and prefers discord! Hope to hear from you soon.   \n\n\n1. modern day beauty and the beast: mafia boss who takes the daughter of a man who owes him money \n2. famous vloggers who are going through some things in their relationship\n3. vampires: so many ideas here, we'd have to discuss\n4. fantasy: I love DnD and would love to have someone DM a mature game, if that's something that interests you \n5. fantasy: I just love the genre so we can discuss more\n6. slice of life: couple that is reunited after years (maybe pregnancy involved) \n\nI have lots of ideas and I want to keep this vague so we can create something together. Message me if any of these interest you or you want to write something together. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking for someone who is 21+ and enjoys getting to talk OOC too. \n\n  \nLook forward to it!",

The main theme I like to play is romance but we can also add different elements into it if you wish. Please note though, fantasy is a big no! I would really appreciate it if you were reliable, and tell me if it got boring because then it's fair. If you ghost me, don\u2019t expect a sudden second chance. Of course we will both have our own personal lives but I\u2019ll always communicate healthily and let you know when I\u2019m busy. If you're going to message, be serious about this too and have a clear idea about what you want. I can do first or third person, I can change my preference if needs to be. Honestly, I will NOT accept one liners nor will I respond back to you if you're just gonna ghost. I've had enough of people just coming along for short-term purposes when this is LONG term. I cannot stress that enough.\n\nMy list:\n\n\\~Friends from childhood.\n\n\\~Roommates.\n\n\\~Nurse and Solider/veteran.\n\n\\~Prince/Princess falls for a village girl/boy.\n\n\\~Friends with benefits.\n\n\\~Rich Entrepreneur and interior designer.\n\n\\~Gang member and innocent girl.\n\n\\~Strangers.\n\nAnd of course, any other ideas you wish to tell me about. Yes I know these are mildly clich\u00e8, so I\u2019m willing to spice them up and add a lot more angst, or even some dark themes if it does fit with the idea. \n\nSmut will have a very small element in this, but it won't be too overpowering as I want to enjoy the story at its fullest - so it will be discussed fully once the plot has been established and there will always be a good build-up before any NSFW. When it happens though, I'll make sure to attend to your every need. I cannot stress this enough; Please be literate! (more than a paragraph at least). If you deliver on that, I will too. Roleplay is a two way mutual thing and it has to flow in order to keep a story going. \n\nThanks for reading! I use Reddit and kik. If you have any other platform, I\u2019ll be sure to download it if I can but I really do prefer the two I\u2019ve mentioned.",

            "selftext": "Hello you.\n\nThank you for your interest. \nMy name is Murasaki and I'm a 25+ year old student from Germany. \nI am role playing in my free time and that for roughly 10 years now. First 2 years in German, then I switched to English. I am still working on my written English, so I apologize for upcoming typos.\n\nI am interested in romance- mainly MxM but don't mind FxM or FxF or even a triplet. Have done so in the past and enjoyed it.\nI love angst and darker themes and usually my roleplays are all around Romance, fluff, slow burn, angst, violence and smut.\nSometimes there's also fantasy, overnatural, medieval, science fiction, magic and other things involved. That highly depends on my partner's preferences.\n\nStill here? \nNice. Now let me tell you what I absolutely dislike.\nThe overuse of smut and darker themes are a no go for me. Don't get me wrong, I love drama and all that, but if that's something beyond logic or simply doesn't feel right- I might get bored rather quickly. \nI quite like to chat in ooc, if you do as well I would love to talk with you. It keeps up my interest in the rp and helps me getting invested with the characters. Besides it's a good way to share cute pictures of our ships. Sharing is caring!\n\nI get that real life gets in the way or sometimes people lose interest, but please have the decency to say something beforehand. There is nothing worse than to wait for your partner to write back after getting invested in an interesting story. \n\nI do rp as my get away from real life. I suffer with my characters and smile when they are happy. If you share this passion with me, we might get along even better.\n\nI personally write in third person past tense and use to describe as much as I can. I like to give my partner the impression of how my character reacts. Is he sitting down slowly, is he slumping down? That sort of stuff. I appreciate the same in return. \n\nUsually I tend to write about fandoms... And prefer canon over OCs, but I can be talked into almost everything. \n\nFandoms I do like an crave for the time being are things from Overwatch, DCU or MCU. \nAs in other things I have some ideas. \nOh. And I also love abo dynamics. So it'll be an extra + if you do as well :)\n\nIf you are not into fandoms I have some things as ideas set up. So if you feel like we truly match I would love to hear from you via Reddit. \nPlease don't just write me with \"hi\" tell me some stuff about you! And only 18+. If I ever feel like you are underage I quit.",

            "selftext": " Hey guys, looking for some fandom roleplays! Which fandoms you might ask? Let me tell you!\n\n\\- Devil May Cry  \n\\- Overwatch  \n\\- Borderlands \\[Have a prompt below, but a Moxxi would be great!\\]  \n\\- Rainbow Six  \n\\- Dr. Stone  \n\\- Harry Potter  \n\\- Telltale's The Walking Dead \\[Though show or comic works as well!\\]  \n\\- DC universe \\[Looking for a Harley Quinn or Poison Ivy, though open to more options!\\]  \n\\- Dishonored \\[Preferably post 'Death of the Outsider' arc.\\]  \n\\- The Witcher \\[Post 3. I loved how Geralts story ended, time for a new/different character!\\]  \n\\- And I'm open to other ones, so feel free to hit me with them!\n\nFor the Devil May Cry RP, I'm thinking that it should take place post DMC 5 (Most likely several months at least). While I don't mind if you play canon or OC, I'll be having my primary be Nero.\n\nAs for the Overwatch RP I can play canon or OC, and don't mind which you choose (Though canon is a plus.) I'm thinking maybe during the Overwatch's 'golden age' but that can be decided with my partner!\n\nAs for the Rainbow Six RP, I'll most likely have my primary be Mozzie or Maverick (Though I am not confined to only those choices.) As for your primary I don't mind it being canon or an OC. Plot and such will be discussed together. I'm pretty open to most ideas with this.\n\nWhen it comes to Dr. Stone, I'm interested in the concept and would love to do something with OC's, of course canon works as well. This can be discussed.\n\nFinally Borderlands. I'm more than fine with OCs and Canon characters, so no worrying in that department. As it goes, I'm looking for anything in the borderlands universe. So all the games/settings are open to me. While I do want something based POST-BORDERLANDS 3 or AU Borderlands 3. It isn't a must. I can do anything from Borderlands, Borderlands 2, Borderlands: TPS, or TFTB!\n\nI mainly stick to discord but if you prefer another medium such as email or another I'll gladly discuss that as well.\n\nMy schedule is pretty flexible and I can easily get in a couple replies a day, but don't expect that from my partner, real life comes first so if a day or two goes by without a reply it's no problem, but it's a bonus if you can give me a heads up.\n\nAs for themes I don't mind dark themes, and I don't have any triggers so feel free to come at me full force. As for something I'm hoping, I do want romance if possible, but it isn't required.\n\nIf any of those fandoms aren't your cup of tea I'll gladly world build with you!\n\nWhen it comes down to original/world building I primarily enjoy Cyberpunk and high fantasy genre, though I'm open to all options minus realistic historical in most cases.\n\nJust shoot me a message if you're interested and we can get to plotting and RPing!",

            "selftext": "\\~Mortals Vs. Gods\\~ (Placeholder Title)\n\nThey traveled many miles through the blistering heat of the desert; many of the camels died of thirst and they were forced to continue on foot. It took them three days to cross the Arrohgabi Dunes the journey cost them several men along the way, but they had no choice but to continue.\n\nSanura was a sentinel of her people; one of a few hand-picked from the best-trained women in the nation who formed the pharaoh's personal regime. She was tall and powerfully lithe; her dark tanned skin was accompanied by various pieces of gold plating and leather straps that covered little more of her body than what was necessary to allow for maximum mobility. Long ebony hair was braided into tight bound, thin strips and held back by a golden, jeweled headband. Hazel-nut eyes were accentuated by thick turquoise eye-shadow and exaggerated liner created thick borders that framed them ever so boldly. The majority of her exposed skin was marked by the tribal etchings of her people that hugged her well-toned muscles effortlessly.\n\nThe elderly man that accompanied her gently smacked a brown leafy branch on Sanura's broad golden crested shoulders ceremoniously; there was normally a prayer that accompanied it but the gods have forsaken their people already and didn\u2019t deserve the homage. The river that spread fresh life-giving water to the people of the lands continued to dry up for the fifth year bringing a time of great famine and plague that killed people in droves. It was Sanura's duty now to find a way to seek an audience with the gods and plead for their mercy, or perhaps she would slay them and bring a new order to the world! Either this would be no simple task but with the help of some unlikely allies, it's one that must be seen through. \n\n\\---\n\nHello hello everyone!\n\nI've had this idea for an RP set in a fantasy world where things on the mortal planes are going to shit and the gods are turning a blind eye to it for whatever reason. Now the mortals are forced to seek answers from the divine beings and try to reestablish order.\n\nA few quick notes:\n\n* I'm in my 30s and prefer a partner closer to my age.\n* I LOVE romance (especially the forbidden kind) but it's not a requirement\n* I'm ok with ERP but I tend to shy away from it (every RP that I've done that's had sex has turned awkward afterward)\n* I'm busy IRL so my responses come once a day or every other day \n* I write in 3rd person and respond with 3-5 paragraphs \n* I don't use face claims and prefer my partner didn't either (If you can't describe what your character looks like our styles will not mesh)\n* I RP on Discord almost exclusively; please send me a username in your message \n* I'm a storyteller and often take the plot by the reins, but I need a partner who's comfortable and willing to take control of NPCs and drive the plot a bit as well\n\nThat's everything I can think of. If you're interested and think you'd be a good fit send me a brief message about yourself and the character(s) you'd like to bring into the story as well as your discord username. \n\nI look forward to hearing from you guys!",

            "selftext": "Hey reddit fam!\n\nIt's been a helluva long time since I've been able to rp/write stories and I'm on the search for my partner in rhyme.\n\n...\n\nI hate myself for that one too.\n\nSo requirements I suppose:\n\n18+ (Sorry no babies allowed here)\n21+ is preferred but not mandatory\n\n3-4 Paragraphs a reply is usually my standard but things like back and forth dialog between our characters, combat, things of this nature that would call for shorter takes is both welcomed yet should be breifly discussed upon before continuing for too long.\n\nWeekly replies.\nI can usually find time at the very least once a week to go through hours of writing, waiting for a reply, gauging what was set, and sending back a throughout response. Finding someone of that same caliber would be lovely. We can even discuss times that would work out best, but it is not necessary per say.\n\nPlay multiple Parts and Characters\nUnless it's the end of the world.. Our main characters should not get the only roles.\n\nAbove all (though at the bottom of the list)\nCreativity and Communication!\nIt's a two parter I know but go hand in hand.\nBring forth what you have to the plot, feel like some thing has gone wrong and we need to back track? Let me know! It's a story, whatever story we make that can be expanded, editted, and revised when we see fit to make it so.\n\n\n\nAs for what kind of story I'm looking to make? \n\nI have a few I've been toying with. One with a supernatural, sort of horror build to it. It was inspired by one of my favorite webseries, I even made a chapter and a half into it, trying out a new style of writing but I think I lost myself trying to get too complicated with technique when I should have been focusing on the story.\n\nI had the premise focus around one of the characters being a supernatural creature that is linked to a human who has some supernatural gifts that they don't have too well of a grasp on. And prone to the horrors that bringing the devils in may cause.\n\nAnother is a superhero/villian conflict. I love this one, only because the previous person rping this with me really gave it their all and I was sad to see it felt incomplete.\n\nLastly an apocalyptic world. Maybe zombies did it. Nukes. Aliens. Does it matter? It happened way too long ago for anyone to remember. Earth's population of humans is next to nothing and the people that are getting by live in the remains of the massive metropolitan cities. The cities have become entangled by nature and hunting, gathering, and what bit of farming can be done is how people get by.\n\n\nI'm comfortable rping nsfw action, however, time and place and there should be a discussion about what things our characters (and ourselves) are okay with.\n\nAlso for combat, talking to characters (not our mains) thought it'd be fun to roll (d20s) to see how they'd react. Perhaps even give our chracters stats and the like. But that's just an experimental idea I had.\n\nEther way, if you've gotten this far in reading. DM me to let me know if you're interested! I won't take on more than a few partners, only because I do not feel I could give equally to my role plays if I did that sort of nonsense.",

            "selftext": "Hello, I am a roleplayer with over 10 years of experience. I'm 24 years old and back from hiatus to seek someone to roleplay with for an extended period of time. I have a small cast of female characters that I would like to bring back into the light with a committed partner in crime. My preference lies in Fantasy of any sort: medieval, high fantasy, sci-fi, steampunk, etc. The themes of my roleplays are typically NSFW, I like grittier worlds with death, famine, autocracy, battle, and the more enjoyable NSFW things as well, so 18+ is a must.   \n\n\nI am more than willing to work with you and hear about your characters! I want to share imagination with someone again, in the way that only seems to happen very infrequently. We can run with my starters, or come up with something together. I usually write in paragraphs, opening scenes can vary from 3-5, with a minimum of one paragraph length for short dialogue replies. I will expect that you usually have at least a paragraph, but I don't expect you to match me or anything. If you write more briefly, fine, if you write novellas, that's okay too! I'm very open-minded.  \n\n\nIf you're interested, go ahead and send me a DM here, we can exchange Discord info, as that's the medium I use to roleplay. I look forward to hearing from anyone who wants to brainstorm.  \n\n\nBelow, I will list some of my OC's and ideas that I really miss.  \n\n\nDesert Queen x Captured princess (FxF) - A powerful queen of the desert tribes takes a concubine from a selection of people captured from the most recent raid into kingdom lands. The concubine is a noble's daughter, who reluctantly serves the queen to stay alive, but ends up assimilating with the new culture and becomes an ally to the queen.  \n\n\nCrusader x Assassin  (MxF) - Two orphans who grew up together find themselves on opposite ends of the law as adults. The crusader is an ace hunter who tracks down dangerous and magical criminals. The assassin took a darker path and ended up becoming a master killer, who has earned the attention of the kingdom's top crime-fighting agencies.  \n\n\nAssassin x Ranger (FxA) - An assassin from an ancient clan hidden deep in a toxic swamp is hired to hunt down a legendary elf ranger who was born during a windstorm that killed his whole village. His remarkable magic and expert talent mark him as chosen by the God of Wind himself to serve as his agent on middle earth, but he longs for something beyond service.  \n\n\nDemon x fallen angel (FxA) - An exiled demon who turned his back on his own kind to make a life for himself in the human world and a fallen angel who refused to obey orders team up. They both follow their instincts to tell them what is right, but they are inescapably shaped by their nature as a celestial and fiendish being. Together they learn to see life in a new light.   \n\n\nSorcerer x OC (MxF) - A powerful young sorcerer puts his inherited magic to the test. He reads a summoning spell from his grandfather's grimoire and begins the ritual. What comes through the portal is not what he expected. He and the being he summoned are soul-bound. He has full power over it, and it wants to serve him, but his instinct tells him that such absolute power over another sentient being is wrong.",

I'll admit, the one with the king has more potential to me, but it would be veerryy dark and I'd be playing a feminine boy sort of character. The other starter would be straight MxF. That's why I said A4M--I'm a female irl, but the one starter is MxM. I'm more partial to that one right now, but I'll take what I can get lol.

Small town (name to be discussed), alien bio-armor, and all the adventures that entail. It's intended to be a long-term story centered around the character I assume the role of, a junior in high school named Sheamus, coming across the legacy of two extinct races and becoming its inherent. Unfortunately, this (unsurprisingly) introduces complications, as he's forced into a double-life of maintaining his personal life and protecting the people around him, the armor, and himself. \n\n My partner's character is intended to be a classmate/fellow student of his school who inevitably gets caught up in his double-life (during the roleplay, of course). Best friend, crush, etc., it's up for debate. This does not exclude my partner from assuming the role of other characters that we come up with.\n\n  No particular preference, but I do ask that my partner's at least 18 years of age, as the plot may touch on themes of slightly graphic violence and somewhat mature themes. The plot isn't intended to bear any sexual elements regarding characters, but that is up for discussion later on, should my partner wish it.\n\nIf this piques your interest, feel free to message me or leave a comment and we can discuss it further over Discord. Hoping to come up with something great with someone!",
