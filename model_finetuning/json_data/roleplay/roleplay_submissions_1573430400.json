            "selftext": "Hello! You may call me Sena. This is my first ever post on this thread and I hope that it gets quite the view. I have one particular idea in mind... and it requires A very pissed off and powerful witch. I am also seeking a long term partner who isnt afraid to steer the course of the rp, make things happen and challenge the both of us as Rpers. Ill write out the plot below (subject to change)\n\n\n\nIts about a woman graced with wonderous magical abilites, with them she was able to heal the wounded and sickly, raise crop growth, and create a greater commonwealth amongst the city people. They loved her for what she had done, but word about it got out to the king. He sent his knights to capture her in an atempt to use her for his own gain. When she refused he locked her in his dungeon... There she was imprisoned, tortured, and even raped by the knights. For nine gruesome years she was trapped there, and all the time, a sadness so powerful manifested into despair, and that despair turned into devine hate. She hated the king, She hated the people, she hated everything. Eventually before her execution was to take place she managed to escape. With her now powerful black magic, she sought to bring vengance down on the town and the king. However she knew she could not do this alone... So she summoned a 'hundred knight' to fight for her as her lowly servant. The knight showed her true affection and did everything for the sake of the Witch. Eventually the Witch herself feels for the knight..love. But this is where the choices come in. The knight is only allowed to live in the world of the living until their deed is done, after that they returns to Limbo wander for eternity. The witch must choose between Revengance or Redemption. \n\nThis can be done MxF or FxF its your choice.\n\n\nMy Rping style is Lit to semi lit. It really depends on whats happening in the story. Please know that if you choose to play this part, The Witch in question is very very spiteful and mean. She is well aquainted with her power, and will not hesitate to make a move that prove bineficial to her. The knight is her protector bound to do whatever she asks whenever she asks. Be dark, play the role I want to be immersed in the story.\n\nEtertain me if you can, send me a Dm to obtain my discord information.",

After the infiltration of the Chinese Government, several resistance cells opened up around the country- the most notable of which being Valkyrie, a cell located in Buffalo, New York. \n\nOccupation Resistance has mainly robots/androids as a focus but there are some other futuristic elements. Not too advanced like flying cars/hovering vehicles but that's pretty much it.\n\nWe have two bots, Mee6 and Dyno.  \nIf you want to contact me, my discord is Dash#2700 and the server invite is [https://discord.gg/x5UUhwT](https://discord.gg/x5UUhwT)[.](https://discord.gg/x5UUhwT) \n\nThanks for reading this",

I'm not sure how this would be received and I admit, I might be going out of my ballpark some, but nonetheless I want to give this a try.\n\nThe context for this server is kind of running along the lines of: What if Salem and Ozpin was never in a war because Salem was able to successfully resurrect her love and actually lived out their lives happily after his initial resurrection? What if everything went well as a result, and they are the only source of magic in Remnant and there was no need for relics and maidens, the closest equivalent being the 4 daughters who were raised by Ozma and Salem? What if it now was just an era of peace, but with the existence of villains who are out for their own gain, or those with their own personal grudges or revenge on certain individuals? \n\nI'm not sure how this would work out, but I'm definitely determined to try and get it to work somehow!\n\nIf you are interested in helping me out, please feel free to message me on here and I'll send you my Discord Tag!\n\nPlease note that this server is for semi-literate/literate RPers who type paragraphs, so if you're looking for one of those servers and do not want your partner to use one or two liners all the time, definitely consider this!

            "selftext": "Hello everyone, I have a couple of plots I'm itching to play and thought I would try and find a few new partners! \n\nHere's a few things about me/what I like in partners: \n* I'm looking for multi-paragraph novel style. Currently I can post 1 time a day to every other day, usually in the evenings as I do have a full time job. Sometimes I can write more than that, just depends on my schedule.\n\n* 18+ only. I do enjoy having NSFW themes and yes, some smut, so this is non-negotiable!\n\n* Please use proper grammar and spelling to the best of your abilities. Obviously we all make mistakes from time to time, but at least know the difference between your and you're, then and than and etc. \n\n* Currently only interested in MxF. There has to be some element of \"romance\"\n\n* I'm currently looking mostly for female writers to write female characters. To be honest, I think I get on better with female players and I am looking to play the male role in these ideas. \n\n* I don't necessarily think post-length is the be all end all, but I would say on average I write about 250-450 words a post. Honestly, I will probably get bored if replies are a paragraph or less. A reply with a couple of lines will basically guarantee my leaving the RP, just not for me, sorry!\n\n*  I'm currently using discord because I like to have a place to organize everything, so be open to that please. \n\n* Lastly, I really like working with my partner to have lots of twists and turns in the story. So please enjoy a nice amount of OOC chats to plan and plot. I also like face claims and pictures if you're into that.\n\nNote: Please don't suggest that we play \"ourselves\" or get confused with me vs my character. I write novel-esque stories with characters, not myself. I will not ever write in 1st person.\n\n**NOW HERE'S THE PLOTS!**\n\n1. Howl (*If you could only see the beast you made of me.)* HumanxWerewolf. A human girl moves to a small town and meets a mysterious man and his extended family. Little does she know that she's just moved into a wolf's den. What will she do when she falls for the man? Or when she learns the truth?\n\n2. The Longest Ride. Worlds collide when a city girl spends the summer at her relatives ranch house. She meets the young ranch hand whose only ambition in life is to pursue professional bullriding. They may not get along, but they can't resist each other either. \n\nAlso open to other slice of life plots if you have an idea, but those two are my top cravings. If one interests you, PM me and we can discuss it!",

Petals against the empty azure. Dancing low and high. Doomed spirits. Each and every one would come crashing down to dirt and mud. To end. To rot. The cloudless sky carried the two voices far. Across red seas and once-animated forms. Across faded memories. Across what the monks, poets and scholars would call 'Tranquillity' 'Harmony' 'Peace'. And of course, death.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"...You think we'll find any?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDread... concern... like the deer spooked by the idiot hunter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Any what..? Oh! Perhaps... There ought to be one or two...\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBravado, lies. The kind of tone that was used to reassure oneself more so than anyone else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTheir steps were just as audible as the words, yet retained a subtle prowl. Ghostly. A mockingly creeping danger. The death by a thousand cuts. Only the na\u00efve would call such a thing mere suffering. It was nightmare. They did their best to avoid the bodies. The still. Even with total focus such a thing would have been difficult; it had been a big battle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cR-really? But some might have already got away, right?\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cHmm\u2026 Unlikely. It takes time for a Demon to get back on its feet. Especially out away from normal-folk.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t we just burn it anyway? The whole field? That would wake them up! It beats just checking the corpses like this and taking them back\u2026\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cIdiot! And have your life taken instead? Fire cant kill 'em anyway. Besides, this way we get first pick of off the bodies.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cBut the stench alone is- Wait!\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe was right, the stench of the thing was nigh unbearable. But one could argue cooking flesh was hardly better than sitting flesh, at least for the first few days. The other speaker also recited truths. Dying so recently would mean muscles still had to weave themselves back together. Nerves had to be stitched slowly. He was correct about fire too. It was one of the worst ways to die, if the smoke didn\u2019t take mercy upon you, but even in charred dust one\u2019s life went on. They were visible now, having shuffled their bored forms into the corner of the eye. One was tall, the other shorter, and junior too by perhaps two or three decades. The simple garb of peasant battlefield scavengers. One walked with a spear, using the pole as a staff-walking stick. The other, the young, clutched the hilt of a sword tightly, knuckles white, eyes wide.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFear drowned the little man.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cThat one there. It moved didn\u2019t it? I-its eyes! J-just now. A-and look at the colour! It isn\u2019t pale at al-\u201c\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cQuiet! A-are you sure?\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cOf course im sure!\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe older passed the spear to his companion, eyes locking with mine. He too, shivering. \u201cGods your'e right.. S-So\u2026 we tie it up\u2026 and take it back to the capital\u2026\u201d He swallowed low, shaky hands wavering in the spring breeze. Blossom stroked the tip of his nose and was promptly smacked away instinctively as if it were a fly or mosquito. The action seemed to instil a false, drunk courage to the figure. Beady black eyes darted with child like anticipation to his companion lit with the rising sun of new determination. \u201cWe\u2019re rich men! The bounty\u2026 My family wont have to work again!\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe approached.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother death. How many now?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut this fate\u2026 this future.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTorment without end.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would scream if I could move my mouth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe young man turned to crimson mist, something thin hitting him fast through the side of the head. In one ear, out the other, the skull shattering like glass. It caused the decapitated body to flip before landing, the force of the projectile scattering the ruined thing like the petals dancing their last dance in the wind. The older turned before being caught in the side, rending him as a woodsman fells a tree, splinters of bone erupting from the immediately fatal wound. He collapsed like playing cards. His legs one way, the torso the other. Half Split.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA third voice. Out of view.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cYou too?\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe sound of a blood cleaned off a blade.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cImmortal?\u201d\n\n\\---\n\nI am looking for a partner to roleplay with on discord for a (low?) fantasy rp about a character who can not permanently die. Instead, they return from death, their body slowly regenerating. I would ask you to write in past tense for the stark majority of your writing, only including present tense sparingly. I would prefer you to write in third person, but I've had some awesome roleplays with first person writers and wouldn't mind trying out your style!\n\nPlease understand, the above text is not necessarily what your character is thinking. The 'Third Voice' Is also not necessarily your character. Its just a bit of writing to give you an idea of the atmosphere I'm aiming for and explain the concept.\n\nMy initial idea for a setting was one more similar to feudal japan than conventional medieval fantasy (Hence the blossom), but after thought, this idea could really work in any old fantasy setting, even historical fantasy. I still think a Japanese 'samurai' like atmosphere would be the best, but Ill happily discuss other ideas with you, even if you dont want to actually roleplay but just world build. Your character could also be from any background. This could be the first time they are killed and they discover their immortality, or the 1000th, having become totally disillusioned with life. The cost of the power to return from death is that a random mortal somewhere nearby dies instead, their life being taken in exchange for yours. Equally, Immortals do not age, instead passively draining the 'life force' of mortals around them - mortals around them slowly get more frail/age quicker, while immortals stay forever in the body of their first death. These immortals, considered monsters by society, are hunted relentlessly. While most live solitary lives away from the danger of potentially killing an innocent, otherwise fight against the nations that despise them.\n\nI intend the main themes of the RP to be about social isolation, desperation, nihilism and the overcoming of all three. \n\nI've had a few people in the past suggest a Norse theme for this RP. While I think this is a fantastic idea, I also want for a 'civilisation' feel (Big cities and castles) for alot of the setting. Perhaps your character is from this Norse like culture however? We can certainly set a portion of the story there.\n\nRomance is by no means a necessity for this role play, but it is always quite fun. I think its best to wait and see what happens organically between characters regardless.\n\nI normally write 150-500 a response, one or two responses a day. I don\u2019t expect a partner to match me out of obligation, but I would like at least over 100 words. A lot can be said about even the smallest of actions or sentences.\n\nIf you have any questions, please ask in the comments below so others might read them. I'd really appreciate if you include some information about yourself and the timezone you live in, as well as a writing sample as I will not reply to messages without one.\n\nI hope to hear from you soon.",

            "selftext": "\nHello. It's nice to be here. I'm almost new about the rp so that's why I do semi lit rp. I got ideas for a role-play. I'm looking for a male robot (Android) and I got few ideas so my partner can help and ask of course if something can be better or in another way. \nI can tell only few things about me. I'm 19 years old and I like a lot sci fi an action\n\nIdea 1: \nThere's a futuristic strange city. Where physics doesn't have sense and strange beings make people disappear. Inside a strange scrap yard a human (my character) was kidnapped but he could escape. He found a strange robot (military or a butler.) That ended inside the scrap yard for a strange reason because he was such a new model and enterprises just scrap robots when there are more than 500 defective units. After my character fixes the robot they both had to escape from the scrap yard and figure out how they ended there.\n\nIdea 2:\nA human (my character) found a damage Android (your character) at the stree. My character will repair and program him. He did this because he wants to learn how the Android works and maybe use him for a project for college. He will program him as a butler and a bodyguard robot. That Android likes to learn and he has a secret unused the archives from his memory. The Enterprise that made the Android was making illegal experiments. The Android sometimes shows signs of self aware and love to his new owner but also can take hard decisions.  This idea Will be more calm and slow. It's more about emotions a big inspired by the movie &lt;&lt;Her&gt;&gt;. \n\nIdea 3:\n19th century .Close to a almac\u00e9n and old crazy says that he used to see strange creatures that looked like wolf and human at the same time.  Werewolves are looking for people to eat them. Until a hunter (my character) decided to go and fight against them. He's not the only one but (my character) wanted to see where they come. After months of investigation he discovered something strange. Actually... Those \"werewolf\" are actually  robots sent by aliens. They recollect blood for getting energy and slowly domain the earth. in that place there is a spaceship with the werewolf being programmed and giving the blood collected previously to the spaceship . Those aliens are really too weak but they are good when we talk about creating machines.One of the werewolf (the partner's character) noticed the hunter (my character) presence and the werewolf follows his programming. The creature follows and hunts the hunter as my character will try to escape because if he shoots he could alert the rest of the werewolf. When the werewolf a d the hunter go too far the hunter will shoot at the werewolf. They both will fight. The werewolf gets damaged and falls but the bot has a repair system so he fixed himself, however the software is critically damaged so now his program tags the hunter as his master. Now they both have to fight against the aliens for being safe and getting the earth free. \n\n.\n\nI hope you like the ideas. Here are some things to take in consideration.\n\n_Sadly I can't do advanced role-play because I get often busy and I'm new in rp. Sorry :( \n\n_Ask or suggestions are acceptable here. It doesn't matter if it's not exactly like the ideas I wrote here.\n_Try to add character development . I mean for example a character can start maybe being rude and when the rp progress it can change . Maybe the robots can be monotonous but then they can get self aware.\n\n_If I don't answer quickly don't worry. Sometimes I get busy but I'll answer when I can.\nThanks for reading and see you soon . Pm me for more  information.\n\n\n_If you can't answer quickly, do not worry. I'll wait",

Please don't be too harsh and if you don't like the show then please don't comment or pm this is strictly for fans!\n\nPlot: Octavia (my oc) and Alice were good friends especially when you consider they were actually together a few days before the events of the show but besides that they were friends with the two woodcutters eugeo and kirito but on the day of the visit to the ice cave Octavia skipped out because she was scared of the end mountains so the events with Alice still take place and when she's about to get taken Octavia tries to attack the knight only to break the taboo index and her eye bursts\n\nSo what did you think?

            "selftext": "Hello again! This Roleplay is my original plot, but it takes inspiration from a book called The Art of Racing in the Rain. If you haven't read it, I'd recommend it, but the basic plot is that an old dog loves his owner so much that he wants to pass away sooner under the belief that he'll be reincarnated as a man and he'll be able to stay with his owner. Well, what if that were actually the case? I'm looking for someone,male or female, to play the reincarnation of my characters' dog. I'd prefer if your character was female though, but I don't care what gender you are in real life. Just a quick note, your character will be 100% human, she'll just remember how things were in her past life. And she'll be reincarnated as a grown woman because plot reasons. Anyway, if you're interested or have any questions, my comments and inbox is always open! I hope this interests some of you!\\~",

            "selftext": "Hello there!\n\nThis will be a bit of a short one, since it's already 11PM over here, but nonetheless I hope it catches some interest!\n\nAs you can probably guess from the title, I'm looking for sci-fi and fandom related things. The two main things I'm interested in right now are Destiny 2, and Star Wars, both of which are sort of sci-fi and fantasy combined, but still fun though! I have a few small ideas for them, so hopefully this will interest some of you.\n\nFor Destiny 2 stuff, I would love a RP based on the [Remembrance Quest](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1404963370/remembrance/), since the lore associated with the [Luna's Howl](https://www.light.gg/db/items/153979396/lunas-howl/)/[Not Forgotten](https://www.light.gg/db/items/153979399/not-forgotten/) hand cannons is pretty cool. It's basically John Wick but with Space Magic^(TM), which you have to admit is quite awesome! Would love to come up with some fun stuff to play inspired by those!\n\nFor Star Wars I don't have a huge amount, I have a few characters, mostly force users of both sides, but I'm mostly interested in brainstorming to see if we find some shared interests in that universe! I like most eras, including the new movies (sue me lmao), so I bet we could have a lot of fun with this as well! Especially if we ignore canon and lore and just do whatever we want.\n\nIf you'd like to chat more just send me your Discord ID, and I'll add you there.\n\nTalk soon!",

Yes, the idea is inspired by those very common pornographic Casting Couch videos. The catch is that I want the build-up to the inevitable to be strong and full of depth. \n\nIs your character a waitress who is looking to make more cash? Is she a down and out actress desperate for a role? Is she engaged to a man who she loves but isn't making enough money to support her and pay for their wedding? Is she married? Does she have a boyfriend who doesn't know where she is? It's all up to you! The interview process is the main attraction here. While the smut is important, the journey getting there is the juicy part.\n\nYou will have complete freedom of character. So long as you understand that the inevitable sex on camera will take place, and that it will be built up and extremely exploitative, we'll be good to go! So, if you're looking to play a character who gets brilliantly taken advantage of, I may just be your partner of choice! Hit me up in the DM's, and thanks for your interest!",

Preferably this involves interaction with the canon cast; I\u2019d LOVE to interact with someone\u2019s Dettlaff especially, though I acknowledge this is a highly specific request, and most people shy away from canons when dealing with romance.\n\nOtherwise, I\u2019d love to plot out anything involving monsters and/or higher vampires, potentially other witchers, and witches. I can\u2019t say I\u2019m terribly invested in the human politics of the series, but I\u2019d like to think I know enough to navigate those waters if they ever presented in our story.\n\nI have over 10 years+ of writing experience. I don\u2019t like to consider myself pretentious, but I am particular when it comes to writing styles and compatibility. As such, I am happy to exchange writing samples before either of us commit. I exclusively write in 3rd person, past tense, multi-paragraph (though length may vary based on scene and characters involved.)\n\nI\u2019m in my 20s and work part time. I would really REALLY prefer to write with someone over the age of 18. Anything less is completely outside my comfort zone, regardless of the story\u2019s nature. \n\nI think that\u2019s about it!

Also, I'm in the Central Timezone\n\nSo, lately I've been wanting to do a pokemon roleplay. It's Pokemon, so the themes are not gonna get mature, as should be obvious. I'm looking for 1 person. This'll never close, so I'm gonna have multiple of this rp going on.\n\nFor the roleplay, I still don't know if I wanna do a custom region or a canon region. We can decide that ourselves.\n\nIf interested, PM me and we can discuss details!",

I get a long abandoned house in the middle of nowhere, and I suddenly discover you: a maid who is magically tied to the house.

The timeline can be set anywhere though I really enjoy during the events of the clone wars, and inquisitors and the sisters. Of course I am open to others. \\[Granted I haven't seen the new movies, nor am I interested in seeing them or playing any of the new characters introduced in them. Please do not ask.\\]  \n\n\nMy primary will definitely be male, so please keep that in mind. Whether he is canon or OC can be discussed.  \n\n\nI do love when romance is involved, however I only do MxF as I am a straight dude. Since this is star wars and there are many races, the ones I'm interested in for romance are human, twi'lek, togruta, and zabrak. Though if you had another in mind it can be discussed.  \n\n\nI RP third person past tense and match my partners length. I can do Novella, so don't worry about me on that end. I am also in the east coast, so my timezone is EST. I tend to be busy Monday-Thursday 6am - 2 pm. After that I am normally free/able to respond. I can easily get at least one response out a day at minimum.  \n\n\nIf you are interested, send me a message!",

            "selftext": "Hey guys! I\u2019m Rebecca, 25, and what I have for you today is something quite unique: I have created a fantasy world and I am looking to GM for anyone ready for an adventure in it! For those who don\u2019t know what a GM is, to put it simply, you will be RP\u2019ing as the main character and I will RP as the \u2018world\u2019 around you. This means that the world at a starting point is set in stone, but as you traverse, interact and create a story, it of course changes, depending on your actions.\n\nThen, onto the world itself. I want to keep my cards close to my chest a bit as I think it\u2019s more fun if you go in blind and explore and discover what can be found there organically through the story, but I want to share a few important details. The world is essentially a large grand continent and is inhabited 100% by women. Depending on where the various communities, kingdoms and cities lie however, these women differ greatly, although almost all of them could probably still best be described as human. So no orcs, goblins, etc., although non-humanoid (fantasy) creatures still exist. The technology-level of the world is Medieval, so swords, bow and arrow and horseback riding, but things like architecture, clothing and other culturak elements of places and people may also be inspired by other eras, including modern times. For example, the general fashion style of the world is completely 2019, but the weapons are more 1019.\n\nThen, onto your character, or rather, character essence. Because yes, you do not really play one person. Instead, you play as The Legendary Hero, a term used for anyone with the Hero Essence, which means you are the chosen one to save the continent from the grave danger it is facing at the moment. The Legendary Hero however is not one person: Once a Legendary Hero dies, the Hero Essence is passed on to another young girl who\u2019s 18th birthday is on the past Hero\u2019s death day. This means that your character, at that time the Legendary Hero, can die whenever you don\u2019t play your cards right, at which point you will become a different character, albeit with the memories of the past Hero still present. This means that your fight against evil is always high stakes and always exciting, as one mistake can cost your life. I realize the concept might be a bit confusing, so if it got you interested but you don\u2019t quite understand it yet, feel free to let me know and I\u2019ll happily clear everything up.\n\nNow, finally, some last other pointers as to what I\u2019m looking for:\n\n- I don\u2019t care about how long your messages are. Quality &gt; quantity in my book. If you can put everything you need to say in one sentence, be my guest.\n\n- When playing with a GM, I think it\u2019s very important that the both of us have the same image of what things or people look like when playing. This is why I heavily encourage the use of reference pictures when RP\u2019ing. I use them for any relevant character when GM\u2019ing myself and real pictures that is, so make sure you\u2019re comfortable with that.\n\n- I\u2019m pretty much limitless, so anything is fair game in these RPs\n\n- I exclusively RP on Kik, so make sure you mention your username when you PM me\n\nHope to hear from you soon!",

            "selftext": "***All content in the post below is intended for ages 18 and above, aka 18+.***\n\n**This will be a persistent request I will repost on a near-regular basis. I don't check Reddit often during the day, but I check it daily. Whoever I am playing with, do not take it personally. It's just habit.**\n\nFirst, a few things about myself.\n\n33 years old, Eastern Time Zone U.S.A. (GMT -4 for international folks), full time weekday, 40 hours a week, worker. Craving RP with any and all interested.\n\n*Please don't be discouraged by everything here. Some things did require more context to make sense, especially The Catch section. The best we can do is try with each other. :)*\n\n***Basic Requirements and Options***\n\nThird person RP only, Discord is a must because my computer AND phone use it.\n\nWhat I seek is female characters (IRL gender does NOT matter) opposite any of my males/females/anything in between. In what, you may ask? Look below (anything in bold is a big want with me):\n\n\\-Modern (includes fantasy, **slice of life, drama. I love the whole \"love, marriage, baby carriage\" angle in any relationship I do in a story**).\n\n\\-Historical (Medieval (specifically vikings/Norse/Saxon/Crusades/Plantagenet/Tudors era), Victorian/Wild West eras, **1940s/1950s/1960s play**)\n\n\\-Fantasy (this goes into either of the genres above and can account for any of the fandoms below if we do something within those worlds)\n\n\\-Fandoms (Marvel/DC including Arrowverse/DCAU, Once Upon a Time, **Star Wars**, **Game of Thrones aka A Song of Ice and Fire**, Peaky Blinders, **Harry Potter/Fantastic Beasts/Wizarding World,** Vikings, The Last Kingdom, **The Boys**; **Friday Night Lights).** Anime is in here too, though that includes Code Geass, Gundam, Fullmetal Alchemist, the Shonen Jump stuff...Others are open to ask on. Canon characters are a big toss up, so ask on them if you come my way asking to play someone. Bring a few ideas if I say no, just in case.\n\n***Writing and RP Style***\n\nAs for visuals, I have gotten dependent on them. Superficial, lacking imagination on images? It is. But I've played in public SLs over the years who have regularly embraced them, so it's ingrained on me. Usually, actors/actresses/models and the occasional art. I have some to offer if any are open to them.\n\nI favor adult writing and want the same from who I play with. No FADE TO BLACK. PERIOD. Give me the romantic, intimate, and everything beyond it in detail (those that know what this means will get it :) ). I also enjoy players who like to talk OOC.\n\n***The catch?***\n\nI got it down to three simple statements:\n\n1. As often as I am on Discord, even I will have moments of AFK. But I will be around daily, wanting to play a good RP. Ideally, I want someone who fits in the same boat, who can be on and roleplay often.\n2. I love those who are open minded or don't let anything bother them. If I say or do something that you don't agree with, then just say so. I know I will, and we can either work it out or move on.\n3. I don't want to deal with any ghosters or flaky people. If we work out an idea together, whether I contact you or vice versa, I want to stay on top of things with you as much as possible. If RL comes up and you have to go, I get it if you let me know. If anyone is silent without notice for a week, I'll move on and let them contact me at their convenience.\n\n***Conclusion***\n\nFeel free to PM me for my Discord name or offer yours (with the 4 digit number at the end) when you message (no need to wait!). I apologize for the long winded post, but it's the best I can do. **Any interested folks who PM me, please throw in a \"marvelous\" somewhere so I know my post was read rather than the title**. :) I look forward to meeting everyone!\n\n***All content in the post above is intended for ages 18 and above, aka 18+.***",

The morning started as it always did, 19 hours into your shift. \nAs you were getting ready to put on your scrub cap, the ground beneath you began shaking. Nurses flew down the hall as you appeared out of the on-call room, running for the steps. Why would they be reacting so intensely to a small earthquake? \nOne of the nurses stands below you trying to speak, yet your focus was set on the television propped up on the wall. The words \u201cNorth Korea\u201d running across the bottom of the screen made your blood run cold, yet you weren\u2019t making a plan to run, your plan was to be ready for the wave of patients that were on their way. \n\nThis is a little part of the beginning of a story I\u2019d like to build. First or third person doesn\u2019t matter to me. I\u2019m looking for an 18+, semi-literate male that would want to write up an adventure together. I\u2019d like to build not only an amazing story, but a friendship as well. I very much enjoy adding romance as a subplot, it always adds a little interest. \nIf you\u2019ve gotten this far and you\u2019re still interested, I\u2019m looking forward to your message.

            "selftext": "\nWhy, hello there.\n\nThanks for taking time to read through/over this, as I will attempt to make it as understandable as possible. From the title, you can presume (correctly) that this post is mainly searching for possible partners interested in writing about/around/within/etc,etc series/games/shows/movies/fandoms, I (and most likely yourself, if you end up sending a message my way) personally enjoy.\n\nFirst, a few things about myself:\n\n* I am over the age of 18, so more mature themes are more than welcomed- that doesn't mean I am aiming for something smut only.\n* My timezone is EST; I also work part-time, so replies might vary throughout the day.\n* I love OOCC\n* I write in 3rd Person, Past Tense as POV, and ask my partner can do the same.\n* Reply length can be discussed and set.\n* If dealing with Canon Characters, Head-canon ideas and thoughts, can be added in. Love to hear any head canons any might have.\n* If romance is to happen, which I am not against, I am open to pairings of: FxF, FxM, and some MxM. Though, I don't like basing a whole rp around romance.\n* Themes I enjoy include but not limited to: Action, Adventure, Mystery, War-setting, time-travel/loops, Memory Lost, AU's.\n* Anything else, please feel free to ask.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nOnto the Fandoms, in no particular order. Also characters I am open to writing as, or having within the rp\u2019s story. Not limited to anyone mentioned here. (Though, the characters mentioned are more of my favorites)\n\nA note will be made, if there Fandom in Question, and if I am looking for OC\u2019s to be used, instead of Canon characters.\n\n* *Dragon Ball Series\\*:*\n   * Caulifia, Kale, Cabba, Videl Satan, Son Gohan/Great Saiyaman , (Future) Gohan, (Future) Trunks, Xeno Goku, King Kai of Time,\n* *Persona (5)\\* :*\n   * Akira/Ren/Akiren/Joker, Akechi, Makoto, Hifumi, Kasumi (though, as of time writing this, I don\u2019t know anything about her really.), Ann, And Futaba.\n* *Jojo's Bizarre Adventure:*\n   * For this, I wish to create our own Timeline/Universe (as explained later in the manga compared to where the anime is. A multiverse of sorts, exists.) Though, I do wish to keep the idea of the Joestar Family, and others we want to throw in.(I.e, the Zeppeli name, perhaps Brando as well.)\n* *Kingdom Hearts\\*:*\n   * Roxas, Xion, Xemnas, *Luxord,* Ansem Seeker of Darkness, Ansem The Wise/DiZ, Namine, Kairi, Aqua, Ventus, Terra, Riku, Marluxia,\n* *Dc's Arrow-Verse:*\n   * Thea Queen/Speedy, Roy Harper/Arsenal, Eobard Thawne/Reverse Flash, Nora-West Allen/X-s, Connor Hawke/ Spartan (Or, if Legends Time-line/Green Arrow), Mia Smoak/Queen/Green Arrow, William, Ronnie Ramond/ Fire Storm, Laurel Lance/Black Canary/Black Siren, Kara Danvers/Super Girl, Alex Danvers, John Diggle Jr, Grant Wilson\n* *Star Wars: Battlefront II/Inferno Squad\\*:*\n   * The Squad members themselves, and another we wish to add to them. I think adding Juno Eclipse from Legends, could be a good addition to the squad.\n* *My Hero Academia:*\n   * For this, I can go either a Canon play, or OC idea. Though, I'd rather not mix the too much. From the canon characters I like: Izuko/Deku, Ochako, Melissa Shield, Tenya Iida, Krishima,  Mina, Toga, others. I will note, I can't write  Bakugo. (and I don't ship him with anyone)\n* Honorable Mentions:\n   * Sword Art Online/ Gun Gale Online, Legend of Korra/Avatar the Last Air Bender, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, Catherine,Space Dandy, \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nIf there is a fandom here you like, let's try to build something! I have some snippets of ideas for most of them, but I also enjoy creating something from scratch with a partner as well.  If you are interested, feel free to send a message my way (No Reddit Chat, please). Feel free to mention any thoughts you may have, or any characters you wish to use.   \n\n\nThanks for reading!",

Right now I\u2018d be super happy to find one or two new partners for an rp involving MxM romance.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be only romance focused, though! In fact, I\u2018d prefer to create a unique, exciting story with you to bring our characters to life!\n\nThe genre I\u2018d love to set this in is (obviously) fantasy, as I\u2018m really into building my own worlds (and escaping reality).\nI\u2018d prefer my partners to be able to answer at least a few times a day, as I also tend to be very active when I\u2018m invested in the plot.\n3rd person and at least a few lines per reply are mandatory :)\n\nAny questions, concerns, ideas? Comment here or send me a pm, I\u2018ll be happy to hear from you!",

First and foremost, thank you for clicking on this ad in the first place- there's still a lot of character slots open and although we're still in slight development due to being a new server, we're still welcome to newbies since, well, we're all technically newbies anyway!\n\nAs mentioned before, this will feature canon AND OCs- as long as they adhere to the theme of Dangannronpa, a Visual Novel series! It's meant to be a mix of daily life and the occasional exciting stuff- but, as we're still starting out, it's not perfect as of yet! It's all on Discord too, so, if anybody wants the invite just dm me here to ask for my Discord name and I'll DM you the Discord this way!\n\nThe Rules in a nutshell are.\n\n\\-No NSFW(it's a 13+ server, so porn and erp is obviously a no-no on the server).\n\n\\-Be respectful(no racism, homophobia, xenophobia, transphobia, and no slurs or any of that.\n\n\\-No Spam.\n\n\\-No Godmodding, metagaming, or powerplaying.\n\n\\-No jumping into rps without permission.\n\n\\-Only three canon characters and three OCs per person(although we have a system for claiming this- which I'll gladly explain more in DMs!)\n\n\\-Tag V3 spoilers.\n\n\\-Be literate.\n\nAnd some other stuff includes...\n\n\\-Lots of fun bots to play around with ooc!\n\n\\-Nice server/community!\n\n\\-LGBTQ+ friendly!\n\n\\-Unique currency in the works!\n\n\\-Events! Lots of possible events!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut, that's enough of me rambling- please DM me here if you have questions, please! Sorry for the long post!",

It doesn\u2019t need to be the primary focus, but I\u2019d like for it to at least be a secondary one.\n* You must be 18+, I don't feel comfortable playing with minors.\n* I love smut and NSFW content, but I don\u2019t want to ONLY roleplay smut. \n* You must use discord\n\nOptional things that I\u2019d like, but are not required\n\n* Third person (Not doing third person isn\u2019t a deal breaker. I\u2019ll still roleplay in third-person as the GM.)\n* Fandoms to draw inspiration from\n* Having multiple races in our setting (I\u2019m a big fan of playing nonhumans)\n* Having magic/psionics in our setting\n* You getting a harem\n\nIf you are interested, then please PM me.",

I've posted on here before and not found what I was looking for, so here's my second attempt.\n\nTo put it plainly, I'm looking to make original characters with someone who likes: slice of life, romance, horror, light fantasy, some of the above, or all of the above. The theme isn't the most important part to me. I want the focus to be on the characters we make and how those characters interact.\n\nStill reading? Awesome!\n\nSince I am an adult, I am looking to interact with other adults (18+). My preference is roleplaying with anyone who identifies as a woman. I have tried roleplaying with men in the past and it hasn't lasted for more than a couple of replies. Everyone gets busy. I understand because I also get busy (school part-time and work part-time). If you aren't able to reply for a couple of days or have other things going, I'll understand, so just keep me in the loop.\n\nAnything else? Yes! Romance and character interaction is a big part of what I'm looking for when I roleplay. I like smut and don't necessarily want to fade to black unless the scene calls for it. I want a partner who doesn't mind coming up with ideas and is an active participant in our roleplay.\n\nWith that being said, send me some ideas when you message me and I'll know you actually read this. I'll also know what you're looking for and see if we're a match.\n\nAnyone that fits this criteria and is interested in talking, message me on here and let's figure something out! :)",

            "selftext": "This thread contains spoilers for Terminator: Dark Fate. \n\nHello again, Reddit!\n\nI took a break from roleplaying for a bit as I transitioned to graduate school and my new job. However, last night I saw the newest Terminator movie and got the craving to Roleplay again. \n\nSpecifically, I really loved the character Grace and would love to play as her against your character. I would prefer to play her against a female love interest (or platonic friends) as that was the vibe I got from her during the film, however I am not opposed to playing her against a male character. \n\nDisclaimer: this is the only Terminator film I\u2019ve seen, however I am somewhat familiar with the franchise as I researched it prior to seeing the movie. \n\nAbout me: I\u2019m a 24 year old woman in graduate school with a part time job that takes up quite a bit of time. I do make time for Roleplays, and fit them into my life, so I usually respond pretty frequently. I tend to write about 2-3 paragraphs per post in third person past tense. \n\nAbout the Roleplay: I would be okay with taking the rp AU and going against the ending of the film where Grace dies, possibly trapping her in the present world. Or we could have it take place in the future where Grace is from. \n\nHonestly, if you\u2019re interested at all in rping in this world, send me a pm and we can chat and brainstorm.",

Like all final tests, your squad and all others taking the test was overseen by some of the best the Republic had. \n\nFor this test the overseers were none other than Commander Cody of the 212th, And Commander Brayec of the 87th sentinel corps. Brayec was a well known leader, the first non clone and non Jedi to lead a clone legion. He joined the republic for reasons unknown to those outside the Jedi council but as he proved himself in the battle of Geonosis was given a position alongside Jedi master Taya and her padawan. \n\nCody and Brayec were searching for squads to recruit into their respective legions. An honor it would be to be part of either.  \n\nYour clone type, name and all is up to you! I\u2019ve been rewatching the clone wars and am looking for a good clone wars story. Keep in mind I\u2019m also willing to do other related stories as long as the era is clone war. Thanks!",

Petals against the empty azure. Dancing low and high. Doomed spirits. Each and every one would come crashing down to dirt and mud. To end. To rot. The cloudless sky carried the two voices far. Across red seas and once-animated forms. Across faded memories. Across what the monks, poets and scholars would call 'Tranquillity' 'Harmony' 'Peace'. And of course, death.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"...You think we'll find any?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDread... concern... like the deer spooked by the careless hunter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Any what..? Oh! Perhaps... There ought to be one or two...\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBravado, lies. The kind of tone that was used to reassure oneself more so than anyone else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTheir steps were just as audible as the words, yet retained a subtle prowl. Ghostly. A mockingly creeping danger. The death by a thousand cuts. Only the na\u00efve would call such a thing mere suffering. It was nightmare. They did their best to avoid the bodies. The still. Even with total focus such a thing would have been difficult; it had been a big battle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cR-really? But some might have already got away, right?\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cHmm\u2026 Unlikely. It takes time for a Demon to get back on its feet. Especially out away from normal-folk.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t we just burn it anyway? The whole field? That would wake them up! It beats just checking the corpses like this and taking them back\u2026\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cIdiot! And have your life taken instead? Fire cant kill 'em anyway. Besides, this way we get first pick of off the bodies.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cBut the stench alone is- Wait!\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe was right, the stench of the thing was nigh unbearable. But one could argue cooking flesh was hardly better than sitting flesh, at least for the first few days. The other speaker also recited truths. Dying so recently would mean muscles still had to weave themselves back together. Nerves had to be stitched slowly. He was correct about fire too. It was one of the worst ways to die, if the smoke didn\u2019t take mercy upon you, but even in charred dust one\u2019s life went on. They were visible now, having shuffled their bored forms into the corner of the eye. One was tall, the other shorter, and junior too by perhaps two or three decades. The simple garb of peasant battlefield scavengers. One walked with a spear, using the pole as a staff-walking stick. The other, the young, clutched the hilt of a sword tightly, knuckles white, eyes wide.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFear drowned the little man.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cThat one there. It moved didn\u2019t it? I-its eyes! J-just now. A-and look at the colour! It isn\u2019t pale at al-\u201c\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cQuiet! A-are you sure?\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cOf course im sure!\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe older passed the spear to his companion, eyes locking with mine. He too, shivering. \u201cGods your'e right.. S-So\u2026 we tie it up\u2026 and take it back to the capital\u2026\u201d He swallowed low, shaky hands wavering in the spring breeze. Blossom stroked the tip of his nose and was promptly smacked away instinctively as if it were a fly or mosquito. The action seemed to instil a false, foolish courage to the figure. Narrowed black eyes darted with youth like anticipation to his companion. \u201cWe\u2019re rich men! The bounty\u2026 My family wont have to work again!\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe approached.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother death. How many now?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut this fate\u2026 this future.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTorment without end.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would scream if I could move my mouth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe young man turned to crimson mist, something thin hitting him fast through the side of the head. In one ear, out the other, the skull shattering like glass. It caused the empty body to flip before landing, the force of the projectile scattering the ruined thing like the petals dancing their last dance in the wind. The older turned before being caught in the side, rending him as a woodsman fells a tree, splinters of bone erupting from the immediately fatal wound. He collapsed like playing cards. His legs one way, the torso the other. Half Split.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA third voice. Out of view.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cYou too?\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe sound of a blood cleaned off a blade.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cImmortal?\u201d\n\n\\---\n\nI am looking for a partner to roleplay with on discord for a (low?) fantasy rp about a character who can not permanently die. Instead, they return from death, their body slowly regenerating. I would ask you to write in past tense for the stark majority of your writing, only including present tense sparingly. I would prefer you to write in third person, but I've had some awesome roleplays with first person writers and wouldn't mind trying out your style!\n\nPlease understand, the above text is not necessarily what your character is thinking. The 'Third Voice' Is also not necessarily your character. Its just a bit of writing to give you an idea of the atmosphere I'm aiming for and explain the concept.\n\nMy initial idea for a setting was one more similar to feudal japan than conventional medieval fantasy (Hence the blossom), but after thought, this idea could really work in any old fantasy setting, even historical fantasy. I still think a Japanese 'samurai' like atmosphere would be the best, but Ill happily discuss other ideas with you, even if you dont want to actually roleplay but just world build. Your character could also be from any background. This could be the first time they are killed and they discover their immortality, or the 1000th, having become totally disillusioned with life. The cost of the power to return from death is that a random mortal somewhere nearby dies instead, their life being taken in exchange for yours. Equally, Immortals do not age, instead passively draining the 'life force' of mortals around them - mortals around them slowly get more frail/age quicker, while immortals stay forever in the body of their first death. These immortals, considered 'demons' by society, are hunted relentlessly. While most live solitary lives away from the danger of potentially killing an innocent, otherwise fight against the nations that despise them.\n\nI intend the main themes of the RP to be about social isolation, desperation, nihilism and the overcoming of all three.\n\nI've had a few people in the past suggest a Norse theme for this RP. While I think this is a fantastic idea, I also want for a 'civilisation' feel (Big cities and castles) for alot of the setting. Perhaps your character is from this Norse like culture however? We can certainly set a portion of the story there.\n\nRomance is by no means a necessity for this role play, but it is always quite fun. I think its best to wait and see what happens organically between characters regardless.\n\nI normally write 150-500 a response, one or two responses a day. I don\u2019t expect a partner to match me out of obligation, but I would like at least over 100 words. A lot can be said about even the smallest of actions or sentences.\n\nIf you have any questions, please ask in the comments below so others might read them. I'd really appreciate if you include some information about yourself and the timezone you live in, as well as a writing sample as I will not reply to messages without one.\n\nI hope to hear from you soon.",

I\u2019m in the midst of designing an erotic comic book (check profile for reference) and I need inspiration of the characters interaction with one another, which is why I\u2019m ultimately here. Here\u2019s a short pitch of the world setting:\n\nIt\u2019s portraying a stubborn, aggressive and prideful 20yo human girl who is surviving on her own in a dessert wasteland, set thousands of years post apocalypse. There is a common enemy among humans, an alien life form that came to roam earth for resources, searching for whatever\u2019s left of animals and humans to feast on. They don\u2019t feed upon flesh,  but on intense emotions that their victims experience, such as fear, shame, pain and pleasure. When these demons are young, they are controlled by their instincts and intense desire to rip a human into shreds, to get that moment of fear right before somebody dies. When they are older and more in control of their impulses, they will keep a human with them instead going on killing sprees, since humans are now becoming more rare and hard to find and their emotions had to be siphoned in rations to ensure the much longer duration they can feed on one single human.\n\nMy characters, the girl and the alien eventually cross each other\u2019s paths, and the struggle begins with the girl wanting to be as far away for the alien as possible, even trying to kill it. He thinks it is amusing to see her struggle with the reality of her fate, and as much as he finds it very alluring that she is not afraid of him, he also has a disciplinary way of treating her, demanding her to respect him as the superior. So there\u2019s a lot of powerstruggle, who\u2019s in control, discipline and coming to terms \n\nI don\u2019t mind playing either character, bratty sub girl or sadistic dom alien. I\u2019m also flexible to RP with different characters and setting entirely as long as the same type of theme remains.\n\nDiscord\\skype\n\nPrivate message me if you are interested and I\u2019ll send you my username.",

So here is what I am thinking, message me and tell me your idea. Most likely we can attempt it or maybe put a spin on it to something more we will both enjoy. I am open to all fandoms as long as I know them or even better unique ideas. I can do NSFW if that is what you want. I prefer discord or maybe reddit chat. Please hit me up and let's talk :)",

Will you become the secret turn of the war, or will you be the unstoppable force to crumble everything your masters tried to build.\n\nRole 2: Russian Assassins \nCharacter: Undefined\n[Set in the same world as the first roleplay the inhuman soldiers won the war  and in turn set in place a modern soviet union, you'll find there will be more consiquenses behind the scenes of what's about to happen here, these people have next to no rights and often find themselves belittled by humanity, this one uses a lifetime of stained hands to offer their services, and you wanted someone gone, unaware of who they really are.",

            "selftext": " \n\n# \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHello    all, I'm relatively new to the role-playing scene here. I\u2019m  interested  in starting a story with one of my male characters in a  unique world.   Growing up I was fascinated by LOTR and other olden time  RPG type  stories and I was hoping to re-create something  like that as  far as the  world goes. Although I can do something more modern. NSFW  aspects are  welcome, but I\u2019m  trying for that not to be the focus.  Also, I would  like it to be for a  longer RP so story lines can  develop, and  characters can grow so the  action might not come right  away. I\u2019m not a  stickler about where you go  with the story and I won\u2019t  get all bent out  of shape like some people do  when you don\u2019t adhere  to their exact  style or the direction they want  to go in. Just a chill  laid back RP  that we both can enjoy and be proud  of. Below will be  the titles of  some example prompts.\n\nAs  for the  writing style I  usually write anywhere between 200-500 words  at a time  in the 3rd  person, but you can write in whatever style  you\u2019d. I\u2019m not  going to say  I\u2019m the greatest when it comes to grammar,  formatting, or  even writing,  but I try my best, so please try too. We  don\u2019t have to be  too frequent,  maybe once or twice a week or more if  you\u2019re really into  it. OOC  conversations are very much welcome as we  can brainstorm ideas  to  develop characters and bounce ideas off each  other.\n\nElven Emissary\n\nKnight x Princess\n\nPrincess Captured by Rebels\n\nPrincess running away from arranged marriage\n\nSeeking Necromancer\n\nFeel free to Message if you're interested. Cheers!! :)",

So we could use that cannon if you wanted! If not, I\u2019m happy for all suggestions!\n\nI just love the epic scope of these beasts towering over us, making us feel like specks of sand.

I have two solid characters in mind that I could play in this, and most of the RP would be involving your sessions with the girls as you try to help them.\n\nI have some theories in mind on things that we could do to add a twist to the RP in one way or another, but we can talk about those when we're discussing the RP itself. Some NSFW content regarding character backstories may be involved, although I don't want any in the RP actions themselves, and the backstories can be omitted if you would prefer.\n\nIf you would like to give this RP a try, please let me know and we can talk out the finer details. I really hope to hear from some of you.",

There hasn't really ever been a film that has struck me quite like Joker. Its intense scenes left me questioning every little detail's reality and has raised a curiosity I would like to pursue. The film has incredibly relatable themes at times, leaving me wanting to connect to the main character. This recently-grown curiosity has driven me to post here in hopes I may find a partner to write with regarding this certain origin of Arthur Fleck and his 'journey' to plummeting into his new identity as the Joker. \n\nTo put it simply - I am seeking a partner to play Joker (Arthur Fleck) against my female OC in our own spin/story based upon the film. I am looking to play the role of Sophie Dumond - just an innocent woman (my OC) Arthur finds himself unrealistically attached to after just one casual exchange. However, this meeting can be anywhere at any time in the storyline. Our story can take on any different characteristics/paths that stray from the original film, just as long as Arthur forms an unhealthy crush on my OC. I would absolutely love to see how our characters would piece together in the grimy streets of 1980s downtown Gotham. \n\nI play in 3rd person. My writing ranges from semi-lit to novella depending on how much I am inspired. That being said, I will always try to never fail to deliver. I play on Discord preferably, but I can also write on Kik.\n\nPlease PM me if you're interested in playing this role! Thank you in advance!\n\nDon't \\~\\~forget to\\~\\~ smile! \ud83e\udd21",

Being several centuries old, he\u2019s experienced countless historical events. So this could be either a historical or modern RP, I\u2019m fine with either. I enjoy both fluff and angst, so it would be fun if we could incorporate a mix of both. I don\u2019t have an exact plot in mind, that depends on how our characters meet, etc. I would like for this to be a slow burn and take our time developing the relationship.\n\nI am fine with darker themes and have no real triggers, so if you want to take the story in a very dark direction, we can do that. I\u2019m 18+ and can do NSFW scenes, but it\u2019s certainly not a requirement! I\u2019ll leave that up to my partner.

To specify, I mean to find a partner that is willing to roleplay as Jesse Mccree and do a [probably short] roleplay on him and a male oc of mine. \n\nI've wanted to do this for a while and it would be great to just write it out with someone, and ride out the Overwatch-High before I crash. \n\nIf you're willing to, you and I can brainstorm. If you're willing to roleplay a canon character but refuse to plan, then let me throw in a prompt that everyone loves to do with a fresh character:\nIntroducing that new character, and play out how they would meet in a certain or new setting, Why the met or what made them meet, does the established character care, and Whos left feeling what.\nI already have an idea of one thats already mapped out, but I rather talk about it in messages than just post it on here.\nThis is the main rp that I want to do. Other game inerests I have besides Overwatch are Mass effect, Dragon Age, Skyrim, and Dead by Daylight.\n\nFirst off, write in 3rd person; secondly, I'm looking for a partner that is 18+. Not anything less. It is preferable that you don't give me short replies, give me something that I can respond to. NSFW is welcome, but talk it over with me before diving head first. Send me a message and hopefully we can agree on something!",

(Delta, Soul Merging, etc etc). There will be a max of 3 Pokemon on your team, you are able to choose your starter. And you will NOT win every fight!\n\nThe towns, in order are Northwich, Acton, Venzor, Eastbourne, Meta, Cadbury, Slocomb, Wolfling, and Xalta.\nHere is the [map](https://imgur.com/a/eKCVmqw)\n\nThere is a full storyline to go with this, if you want a traditional start, if not, there are other stories as well. Please, do not let my limited explanation deter you! I offer starts such as Traditional, Police, Team Member, Professor Student, SxDex, and more! I have a full map of the region, as well as  a way to track your pokemon and such.\n\nBattling will be handled in a realistic and proper fashion, and do not expect to win every fight at all.\n\nMore info if I am Messaged.\n\nThank you!",

So,  I would like to try out a roleplay where the character/characters get the ability to transform into whatever shape/form they want as a liquid version of metal/latex (Whatever you prefer).\n\nI really like long term roleplays with some plot attached to the smut part. There are multiple ways by which the transformation could work in our storyline and I would love to hear your part of the story.\n\nI have a few ideas like \n\n-Scientific experiment gone wrong.\n-You injecting yourself with a foreign substance.\n- Alien technology somehow lands in your hand and you are not sure how it works.\n\nThere are endless possibilities that could be discussed along with the plot where we can take this RP. \n\nMy kinks include - Transformation, Corruption, Bimbofication, Light BDSM, Ass play, Sexy outfits (Stockings, boots, latex, lingeries)\n\nLimits- Scat, Death\n\n\nLooking forward to hear from you ;)",

(Like, 9 maybe? It\u2019s my lie, I\u2019ll tell it how I want to.)\n\nAnyways, I haven\u2019t done text roleplay in a hot minute but I\u2019ve been stumbling across Pinterest and Tumblr ads that have been peaking my curiosity as of late. Plus, meeting new people is always cool. (I say \u201cpeople\u201d yet I post for chicks... yikes. What can I say? I have preferences.)\n\nAnyways, Anyways; I have a specific scenario in mind that I would like to play out. (I have the image it\u2019s based off of.) It involves a young Prince who has his own personal guard, and she often catches him admiring her body. The only thing that might catch you off guard is I want to play the Guard, with you as the Prince. That\u2019s just the simple idea, we can expand much further than that if you want.\n\nLike I said before, I\u2019m pretty casual for the whole scenario. I don\u2019t have any of my own OC\u2019s or specific fandoms that I follow. For this specific request, I would prefer a fantasy setting. I generally write around a paragraph, with a little more or a little less, and I\u2019m down to discuss most kinks or desires you may have. I\u2019m in the EST time-zone, work a full time job and go to school Monday-Wednesday, so I\u2019m rather busy. However, I promise to get back to you a few times a day at least.\n\nIf I haven\u2019t managed to scare you off yet, that\u2019s pretty cool I guess. Feel free to shoot me a message on here and I can get you my Discord info, unless you use another messaging platform. (Then we can talk about it.)\n\nThanks for your time, have a wonderful day!\nKat",

            "selftext": "***All content in the post below is intended for ages 18 and above, aka 18+.***\n\n**This   will be a persistent request I will repost on a near-regular basis. I   don't check Reddit often during the day, but I check it daily. Whoever I   am playing with, do not take it personally. It's just habit.**\n\nFirst, a few things about myself.\n\n33   years old, Eastern Time Zone U.S.A. (GMT -4 for international folks),   full time weekday, 40 hours a week, worker. Craving RP with any and all   interested.\n\n*Please   don't be discouraged by everything here. Some things did require more   context to make sense, especially The Catch section. The best we can do   is try with each other. :)*\n\n***Basic Requirements and Options***\n\nThird person RP only, Discord is a must because my computer AND phone use it.\n\nWhat   I seek is female characters (IRL gender does NOT matter) opposite any   of my males/females/anything in between. In what, you may ask? Look   below (anything in bold is a big want with me):\n\n\\-Modern (includes fantasy, **slice of life, drama. I love the whole \"love, marriage, baby carriage\" angle in any relationship I do in a story**).\n\n\\-Historical (Medieval (specifically vikings/Norse/Saxon/Crusades/Plantagenet/Tudors era), Victorian/Wild West eras, **1940s/1950s/1960s play**)\n\n\\-Fantasy   (this goes into either of the genres above and can account for any of   the fandoms below if we do something within those worlds)\n\n\\-Fandoms (Marvel/DC including Arrowverse/DCAU, Once Upon a Time, **Star Wars**, **Game of Thrones aka A Song of Ice and Fire**, Peaky Blinders, **Harry Potter/Fantastic Beasts/Wizarding World,** Vikings, The Last Kingdom, **The Boys**; **Friday Night Lights).**   Anime is in here too, though that includes Code Geass, Gundam,   Fullmetal Alchemist, the Shonen Jump stuff...Others are open to ask on.   Canon characters are a big toss up, so ask on them if you come my way   asking to play someone. Bring a few ideas if I say no, just in case.\n\n***Writing and RP Style***\n\nAs   for visuals, I have gotten dependent on them. Superficial, lacking   imagination on images? It is. But I've played in public SLs over the   years who have regularly embraced them, so it's ingrained on me.   Usually, actors/actresses/models and the occasional art. I have some to   offer if any are open to them.\n\nI   favor adult writing and want the same from who I play with. No FADE TO   BLACK. PERIOD. Give me the romantic, intimate, and everything beyond it   in detail (those that know what this means will get it :) ). I also   enjoy players who like to talk OOC.\n\n***The catch?***\n\nI got it down to three simple statements:\n\n1. As   often as I am on Discord, even I will have moments of AFK. But I will   be around daily, wanting to play a good RP. Ideally, I want someone who   fits in the same boat, who can be on and roleplay often.\n2. I   love those who are open minded or don't let anything bother them. If I   say or do something that you don't agree with, then just say so. I  know I  will, and we can either work it out or move on.\n3. I   don't want to deal with any ghosters or flaky people. If we work out  an  idea together, whether I contact you or vice versa, I want to stay  on  top of things with you as much as possible. If RL comes up and you  have  to go, I get it if you let me know. If anyone is silent without  notice  for a week, I'll move on and let them contact me at their  convenience.\n\n***Conclusion***\n\nFeel   free to PM me for my Discord name or offer yours (with the 4 digit   number at the end) when you message (no need to wait!). I apologize for   the long winded post, but it's the best I can do. **Any interested folks who PM me, please throw in a \"marvelous\" somewhere so I know my post was read rather than the title**. :) I look forward to meeting everyone!\n\n***All content in the post above is intended for ages 18 and above, aka 18+.***",

Some settings that I enjoy are supernatural, slice of life, historical, military, and more. I have a few pairings and plots in mind already!\n\nA fair warning, I have a tendency to bring in dark themes in my RPs. That means violence, abuse, toxic relationships, age gaps, affairs, etc, so this is definitely not for the faint of heart. There can be smut and NSFW and I do enjoy my fair share of it, as long as it doesn\u2019t dominate he entire RP. (My kinks include: ddlg, spanking, lingerie, semi public places, humiliation, worship, cum play, oral, rough sex, light bondage, etc) \n\nIdeally you roleplay using the past tense and third person (I don\u2019t much enjoy first person). We can RP either via discord or google docs, but all plotting and chatting has to happen on Discord as I don\u2019t really use this site that much. \n\nIf you\u2019ve read this far, message me through here and we\u2019ll figure something out! If we click, I\u2019ll give you my discord and we can go further from there. c:",

Specifically a squad from what was left of the United States military after the last defense falls down. With no official goal or sights, they're forced to survive a twisted version of the world.

I am currently looking for someone who wants to explore new worlds, go on daring adventures, and fight against foes in epic battles. Sound like your kind of thing? Then read on adventurer.\n\n*As you stand upon the hill, looking around at the vast wooded landscape at your feet, you are struck with the thought that the world is so much bigger than you ever dared to imagine. Full of forests, mountains, oceans, land worth exploring. Everything out there, just within your grasp and yet so far away. Even as you look upon this beautiful landscape, you can feel it. The darkness that slips from the corners of the world to ruin such things. To take away people\u2019s power and freedom. The world needs a hero, now more than ever. Could that be you?*\n\nI am currently looking to run a dungeons and dragons style one on one campaign. I have done plenty of group campaigns in the past, but currently I\u2019m looking to do something a little smaller scale. So this will be a singular, one on one campaign though you will be able to make NPC companions to help you along the way. We can discuss things like if we want to use dice, stats, etc. I only have a few requirements for who I write with, listed as follows.\n\n* You must be 18+. I only feel comfortable writing with those above 18 so this is not negotiable.\n* A good grasp on grammar and storytelling would be a huge plus.\n* Developing characters and the world is going to be essential, you must want to create a deep and complex character that has to face the world I send your way.\n* I am currently looking for someone who is okay writing a hero type, this doesn\u2019t mean classic goody two shoes by any means, it simply means if you just want to kill things and cause trouble in the world then I\u2019m probably not the DM for you.\n* Lastly, and this is important, you must be willing to do more than use brute force to every problem. I want to see some unique solutions, talking to people and developing relationships, and general good story appearing as we go.\n\nIf all of this catches your attention, and I hope it does, I ask for a few things to get sent my way. If these aren\u2019t included I won\u2019t contact you back. So. Send me a message with what you want to be called, your pronouns you prefer, your age (at least roughly), your experience with writing in general, and what interests you about this. Thank you for taking the time to read all of this, I hope to hear from you soon!",

            "selftext": "I'm gonna get all the boring stuff out of the way first, **read this anyway**. I'm looking for someone to play a **female character**, they don't have to be girly, I would actually prefer they aren't. I like to roleplay on **Discord**, but I may be persuaded to stay here. I expect **responses with effort**, I'll give you the same. If you get bored, **let me know**. I get it, it happens. It's okay. If there's something you want to see/want to skip/want to include/what have you, **let me know**. With all that being said, you can ask me questions or whatever else you want to say before we start. Now the fun part. \n\nAngela and [y/c] had been friends since they were little. They always lived next door to each other, went to the same schools, knew each other's parents, needless to say they were the best of friends. Whenever they would play as kids, [y/c] was the adventurous one. The one climbing trees, swinging sticks, throwing rocks, getting into trouble. Angela was the worrier, always telling you to be careful, more at home inside baking and being crafty. But still, inseparable. \n\nIn middle school, she had attracted a bunch of attention, because she was *the only* girl on campus that regularly wore dresses, skirts, ribbons, things like that. She was nice to everyone, always bringing baked things and sharing them with her closer friends and teachers. Even when rejecting people, she would do it as nicely as possible.  \n\nHigh school, however, was a bit harder for her. People weren't as nice, would take advantage of her niceness, things like that. Angela even had a bully! Could you imagine? Over time, she managed to get her to not be such a jerk. And of course, it was just by being herself. She would share food from time to time, offer to listen if they other ever needed to talk, offered to fix her clothes when she saw rips whether they were fashionable or not. Those four years she collected more and more attention the further along she went. \n\nBut just when it seemed like the two of you would be together forever, you got the news. Angela came to tell you in person. She had her trademark smile, but it didn't cover up the sadness in her eyes. She held out an open envelope and [y/c] knew. She had wanted to go to this school for a long time. She wanted to be a botanist and work with flowers. Such an Angela thing. That day was a going away party with both your families. She made all the food herself. The next day, [y/c] took her to the train station, said the final teary goodbyes and watched her leave, never to be seen again. [Y/c] never even got to tell Angela how she felt. \n\nThat was years ago. [Y/c] never really moved on. She changed her hair, style and color, got a few tattoos and piercings and embraced the \"butch\" trope. But all good things must end. She decided to go back to school for whatever she wanted to do. Got accepted to a school a few hours from her home town and shipped out. The dean was helpful and gave [y/c] a tour of the campus, then left her at her dorm to get settled in. \n\nThe keycard reader made a quiet beep, then unlocked and the dorm itself smelled heavenly. The scenes of vanilla and something cinnamony being baked wafted out and filled the hallways. The dorm itself was incredibly clean, as if you could eat off any surface including the floor. All the furniture was decorated frilly and inviting, but looked as though a good number of things had recently been taken off. The TV on the wall was impressive and sitting on a small table underneath it sat a Nintendo Switch with a pink flower sticker on the dock, pink joycons on either side of the small device and a pink pro controller sitting in front of it. Of course, this little stand wasn't even on the entertainment center, which was mostly empty and completely clean of dust. And then a voice rang out from one of the rooms. \n\n\"Oh Jeez, sorry! Give me just a minute!\" [Y/c] turned her head and, like a wave of emotions crashing into a previously stoic retaining wall and sending it tumbling, came to the realization of what exactly was happening. The girl that came out was wearing a comfy outfit with a pink bandana on top of her head, long, flowing, recently dyed black hair went down her back, and she had a bottle of air freshener in one hand and a duster in the other. \"Hi, I'm Angela, nice to meet you! Sorry, they told me you were coming today but I wasn't expecting it so early!\" Just then there was a ding from a timer sitting on the counter next to the stove. She went over to it with dainty steps, setting her things down on a stool full of other cleaning supplies. She put on a pair of heavy cooking gloves and took out a pan of large cinnamon rolls, some with icing and some without. She set the pan on the stovetop and carefully transferred them over to another dish with a spatula, then turned to her new roommate when they were ready. \"Here, help yourself! I'm almost done with your room. Nobody's lived in it for a few months, so I had to clean it. There's drinks in the fridge if you want!\" She picked up the air freshener and duster again and went back to the other room again. \n\nSo yeah, there it is. I'm sure the idea is obvious, pretty sure I got my point across, all I need now are orange envelopes.",

It has some Harry Potter elements in it. It is described in full detail here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f-ewiqo0U4nosdTZE5UwF-4zCcoIO0p5kJQ6gD0N71I/edit?usp=drivesdk\n\nI'm fine with longer replies. However, I often can't write them myself - in fact, I often can't even write more than one or two lines... I suspect that it has got something to do with my autism. Also because of my autism, I have days on which I can't reply at all. So you should be fine with that.\n\n\n\nAs a gay asexual trans man with multiple queer characters myself, I'm open to all kinds of queer characters if you feel like creating them. Your characters can have romances with one another, of course, but I'm not comfortable with solely romance-based RPs... \n\n\n\nI hope I caught your interest",

            "selftext": "My eighteenth birthday has past and now I, Angela Novocheyev, princess of Novgorod, am eligible to marry. It's exciting, but also means that I get thrown into the hell that is royal and noble matchmaking. Everyone is out to get each others money or titles, it feels like I'm the only one who truly wants love, or at least a little romance, royal or not! But that's not how it works, I'm only allowed to find my match in a small pool of suitors, even smaller as my parents want to marry me off to someone higher up than myself, like one of the many bachelor princes of Europe. I sigh as one of my maids helps to tie up tonight's gown, the crimson fabric fitting perfectly and accentuating the soft curves of my body. My long raven hair is braided down the centre of my back, while my tawny eyes are lined with a very thin line of charcoal, my plump lips coated in a sweet berry tint. My neck, ears and crown are adorned with jewelry of solid gold, the color contrasting against my milky white complexion. I take a deep breath as my father, the King, leads me out into the dining room, prepared for another long evening of acting fake and having to put up with snotty princes.\u00a0\n\n\n(Hi! So I was thinking this would be a primarily romantic, story based role play. I would like you to be either a prince or a king, or maybe even someone else like a knight, and steal my heart! Id like this to be first person, and play either on Reddit PM's or Discord. Send me a PM if you're interested! &lt;3 )",

This realm is unlimited in regards to its whimsical and fantastical details. Any race that your character may be is welcome! If you're interested in a deeply passionate and dramatic plot, this is the story for you. The plot I'm currently thinking of takes place between two very different characters, possibly even from different worlds. You will play a male OC that stumbles upon a hidden princess. Through their growing relationship, they will face hardships regarding future revolts against her royal blood.\n\nI play in 3rd person. I prefer to use Discord or Kik. Before we write, I ask that you have a written description of your character so that you're prepared for when we brainstorm other plot ideas.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThanks!",

Just for the shits n\u2019 giggles, of course!\n\nAre you on a desperate search for something *vast* to explore? Are you starving for a new *life* to live? Let me introduce you to the clumsiest, pickiest, and terribly dishonest GM of your dreams! Experience Roleplay like never before, where the GM uses maximum mental-output to achieve the most in-depth, flexible, fully-customizable, and truly LIVING environment! Step in to a world where the characters and environment develop over time as you make (or fail to make) important decisions as an impactful figure in the world! Sit back and watch the world turn, or step up and make a mark! Flow with a path carved for you to follow to a glorious, never-ending story, or break out of the general clich\u00e9 and make your own decisions!\n\nWhat will you be capable of, and what will do you with yourself in Grava, the greatest **Medieval-Fantasy-Based World** available!!\n\n*Content may be exaggerated in greatness, and satisfaction is not guaranteed. Your GM may not be efficient in your timezone, or with your possible attitude and personality. Experience may or may not cause psychological effects of positive or negative effect on your destiny. Please contact your doctor before subscribing to the Grava experience. Batteries not included.*\n\nDid that make sense? Of course it didn\u2019t- it wasn\u2019t supposed to, silly-goose!\n\nI\u2019m offering an experience of my own particular specialty- an experience which offers total freedom in a crafted world of my design and control. It\u2019s an experience I hope you won\u2019t regret!\n\nYes, my world is available to casual RPers and individuals interested in relaxing! We can have fun, and I\u2019m happy to guide you through an interesting story of my own design. You will make your own decisions, but the experience doesn\u2019t need to feel as complicated as it may be.\n\nHowever, my world can also test you. For the experienced, hardcore players out there, you may struggle if you choose to fight it. You will need to think both logically and creatively to overcome the BS I have implemented into my own strategies and tactics as a GM. The world and plot will evolve and move both around and regardless of your actions. Both high and low goals can be made and strived for, allowing you to set your own goals and aspirations, only to see them shift and explode. You will be a single person in my world, either important or indistinguishable, and all you will have for yourself are your own plans and skills to survive.\n\nWhat can you expect out of my roleplay experience? Everything, actually. Think of my world as a world, not as a scene. You can find both stories and games, romances and action; mysteries and surprises. I\u2019m offering the freedom to find what you\u2019re looking for, after all.\n\nI don\u2019t see the need to explain anything further. After all, everything I say seems to jumble itself up with the more words I type. Come and see what I have to offer.\n\nIt\u2019s simple: do you want to live in a Fantasy-Medieval-World? What would you look for first? Where would you start?\n\nI have three questions before we begin. They may be answered in-character or out-of-character, and these questions, I think, should be answered ASAP:\n\nWhat single thing do you wish for?\n\nHow will you get it?\n\nWho do you want to be?\n\nOf course, on top of those questions, you might want to tell me a bit about yourself, either in-character or out of character. I need enough information to drop you into my world, too. I need to know how you\u2019d like to arrive, be it as a child or adult, from another land or local, and what sort of place you\u2019d like to begin. I can always offer a few scenes, if you need help. If you\u2019re lost altogether, then I\u2019ll help craft a character for you!\n\nFor longterm roleplayers, I suggest playing as a child! We can work through your childhood together- It\u2019ll be fun!!\n\nYes, NSFW topics are allowed and encouraged for partners over 18, but not required. If such topics interest you, then I\u2019ll need to know about it, as well as any preferences and limitations on the subject. Otherwise, they won\u2019t be included.\n\nP.S. Yes, I\u2019m over 18, and no, I don\u2019t have a preference on which characters I use during Sex. Don\u2019t think about me as an individual, think about me as a world you\u2019re about to live in.",

My character, a female human Jedi spends her days thriving and surviving in the time of war. With that being said I am looking for a partner who would be willing to play Maul. \n \nPremis of the plot: This female Jedi and Sith have developed an understanding for each other that has blossomed into something forbidden. They have spent many years keeping a low profile on their shared relations but things always almost prove to be difficult for the pair. With the brink of War and Maul\u2019s supposed death it seems as though the two would never come face to face again. \nIn the years before the New Hope a Galactic Empire has risen, hunting down the last of the Jedi while new rebellions form. With this female Jedi missing and a well alive Maul thirsting for vengeance perhaps the two will meet again? (This will be more of a reunion for the two characters.) \n \nThis is a rough idea and I\u2019m open to any and all discussion. I have a few plots/scenarios I can share. \nI will also provide you with the background/appearance of my character and how the two initially met. \n \nInfo about me: \n* 6+ year roleplayer.\n* First and third person user.\n* Multiple paragraph user.\n \nIf anyone is interested go ahead and send over a PM.

            "selftext": " It\u2019s a chilly autumn evening, and you\u2019ve stumbled a long way from home. As you walk along the silent countryside road on the outskirts of London, you come across a most unfamiliar sight, and an eerily haunting sound of waltz music fills the night air. Before you stood a castle, one of which seemed to be dragged straight out of a time from long ago, and towered of you in the most unsettling of ways. You, my dear friend, have stumbled across the LaBelle household; a large complex that according to rumors holds a family of wealthy, sadistic vampires within, some of which are as old as time itself... Will you dare to explore further? \n\n----\n\nHello! I\u2019m currently looking for someone to do a detailed, long-term or medium-term roleplay with, that contains both SFW and NSFW themes/scenes. I would be playing as a favorite OC of mine, Louis LaBelle, the youngest and only child of the family living within the LaBelle household. I have no specifics as to what gender character I am looking for, and I have no restrictions on what kind of relationship I\u2019m looking for our characters to have! Love interests? Enemies with a more intimate side? Just friends with benefits? Anything goes! However, I am looking for human characters only (vampires, werewolves, etc. count as well! Sorry furries! ;;)\n\nThe only specifics I have is that I would like someone who can do long, detailed posts (10 good sentences to several paragraphs), in either first or third person, as well as someone who is ok with creating a plot with me, varying amounts of gore, and obviously some NSFW themes/scenes.\nIf you have a love for horror or history, I am totally open to a more historical or horror based roleplay too! If possible, I prefer to rp on Telegram or Discord (due to better notifications), but I can also rp on here! I\u2019m open for any kind of discussion, and I can\u2019t wait to hear from you! ^^ \n\nNOTE: Louis is a very developed character that I put a ton of time and thought into, and I'd be glad to share art of him or describe his character/backstory more if you are interested! Below I have left a thorough run down of his personality, minus the NSFW or gore aspects. Those can be discussed, and altered if need be to a certain extent. I also have an f-list with a ton of information about him!\n\n\nLouis' personality: (if interested!)\n\nWhen meeting Louis for the first time, the first few words that would come to one's mind to describe him are: cocky, stuck-up, selfish, rich, hot-headed, and undoubtedly mysterious. For those who do see these specific characteristics in him aren't too far off. \n\nLouis is a old, yet young-appearing vampire who has always lived in the lap of luxury, and has grown quite accustomed to having the entire world at his finger tips. Though he is always happy to show off his lavish lifestyle, he is aware that not everyone finds his boasting to be very appealing. To most he therefore comes off as a pretentious brat, one who is a lover of attention and at times even worship or envy. Here and there Louis can be described as having a bit of god-complex, however he'd be quick to argue the opposite. To him, he genuinely doesn't see the problem in him being a bit more \"confident\" than most. \n\nOn the other side of the coin, Louis is a fairly sensitive man with a lot he chooses to hold in. After living for such an extended period of time, far beyond the age of any regular human being, he has seen and experienced many things that haunt him to this day. This mixed with his stubborn and stuck-up nature makes for an individual who is in a constant battle with his emotions. On one hand Louis wishes to express the memories that pain him, yet on the other he is held at a unrealistically high standard by not only himself, but his strict parents. Therefore, this vampire has chosen to hold back on letting his what he calls his \"soft side\" show all together, until sometimes it gets to the point where he can't help snaps. When these very specific, rare situations arise, it results in a whirlwind of rage- yet unlike when he's hungry, he chooses to keep these outbursts non violent and to himself. Here and there nonetheless, an unfortunate soul may be the victim of his sharp tongue; especially when certain topics of his past are brought up, or when his emotionless, tough-guy attitude comes into question. \n\nThere is yet another, very unseen side of this French vampire that many never get the pleasure of seeing in person. To those he has become remarkably close with, he is surprisingly pleasant. When Louis finally musters up the courage to let someone in and get to know them, he is charming, witty, creative, and even caring at certain times. He is unbelievably protective of those who he claims to care for. and is over all not a bad person to have around. Yet, to achieve access to this part of him, it takes years of being around his not so attractive side, and then some. \n\nLastly, Louis feels a great amount of pride in being a vampire, especially being one from birth and coming from a long history of other vampires. Nonetheless, he prefers to keep this large part of his identity a secret when meeting new people. Unless someone is a vampire, or close enough to him to where he has opened up about this major detail, it remains a well kept secret. At the same time, people do grow suspicious of this never aging teen here and there, and he ravels in their wish to learn what he will never tell them.",
