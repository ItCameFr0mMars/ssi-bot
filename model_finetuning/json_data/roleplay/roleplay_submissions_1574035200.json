It would take place primarily in the CM universe, the Marvel crossover part is my OC being a mutant. Mentions of SHIELD and Hydra, possible appearances of Marvel characters as well. I would like to pair my character with Spencer Reid and explore her joining the BAU, and how the team interacts with her as a mutant. She does have a background with Hydra, and presumably the FBI would be aware of the organization, that could come into play later on as well when she comes clean as an opportunity for some angst. If you're interested just dm me for my discord! NSFW themes may be prevalent so please be 18+.I'm in CST time zone but I'm active very frequently throughout the day and stay up late often, so I'm not too concerned with your time zone.",

Wary of outsiders and strickt in the control of its people the small towns that dotting the valley saw little of outsiders, all these rules set in place to protect them from the call of distant sirens seeking to corrupt the curious\n \nRole 3: Russian Assassins  **high prefetence**\nCharacter: Undefined\nThese people with the violet eyes wernt quite human, history tells their story differently as it brought the soviet union into the modern world, you'll find there will be more consiquenses behind the scenes of what's about to happen, but for you, all you need is for someone to be wiped from the earth.\n\nRole 4: Demons\nCharacter: Demon lord\nSetting: a power was sensed on earth; like a mass of roots beneath the earth it drew that energy inwards, what you find seems insignificant, a curse and the demon bound there, hidden from those looking for her for centuries.",

            "selftext": "I've been a lifelong fan of the Elder Scrolls series. I grew up playing Morrowind, then moved on to Oblivion and eventually Skyrim when they came out. Recently I've been rediscovering these games, and I'd love to make a story set in Tamriel, with someone else who loves the Elder Scrolls universe.\n\nYou don't have to be super familiar with the lore. I'm not looking for a lore-heavy story, and while I'm open to a different type of roleplay, what I had in mind was a D&amp;D-style adventure, where our characters travel together from place to place, fighting off monsters and visiting towns. I'm generally a more lighthearted roleplayer who likes to insert a bit of fun and humor sometimes. There's a time for dark and serious moments, but if you're looking for some kind of no-nonsense grimdark setting, I'm afraid you wouldn't like me.\n\nWho would our characters be? Well, that depends. I didn't really have one in mind, because I create different characters for each individual roleplay. The only thing set in stone is that I'd prefer to play a male. But I'll be happy with whoever you want to play, whether it's a Breton necromancer, a Redguard noblewoman, a Nord assassin, or an alcoholic Khajiit.\n\nPost length isn't a big deal to me - I can vary from one paragraph to a bunch, depending on what's needed. I'm also in the CST time zone, if that matters. I'm usually busy with college, so I may only have time for a couple replies each day. If you're okay with that, and are interested, great! I'd like to hear your thoughts and ideas, and we can work out the details over PM. Hope to hear from y'all!",

I've had many ideas come to me through my sort of hiatus, but at the same time, I'm just looking for some fun people to roleplay with. I'm available a lot more, but life happens sometimes, and I'll let you know.  \n\n\nWhat I'm looking for is a partner to roleplay their own characters either in a world we create together or a pre-existing. Recently I've gotten more open to using worlds of fiction that have already been created. I'm open to most themes in NSFW territory and try not to shy away from darker stories. I'm looking for someone who knows how to write, at least a paragraph, but more is always welcome.  \n\n\nOnto what genres and worlds I'd be open to do!  \n\n\nGenres:  \n\\-Fantasy\n\n\\-Low-Sci-fi\n\n\\-Dystopia\n\n\\-Fairytale\n\n\\-Superhero  \n\n\n(I'm also open if you convince me)  \n\n\nWorlds:\n\n\\-Starwars\n\n\\-Miraculous Ladybug\n\n\\-Disney Worlds (Any of them)\n\n\\-Skyrim\n\n\\-Marvel\n\n\\-Pokemon\n\n(There are a couple more I am willing, however, these are my favorites, just ask if you have a question on a world/fandom. But reminder I'm not looking for any Canon Character roleplays)\n\nThanks for reading! I roleplay on discord so when you respond if you could pop your tag in there as well that would be great! Have a great rest of your day!",

I\u2019m looking for a partner who is 13 - 16 years old for a slice of life/romance roleplay.\n\nI do have a few things that said partner will have to keep in mind while writing:\n\nThere will be cursing but under no circumstances will I be engaging in any sexual or inappropriate writing concerning my characters or the story.\n\nObviously your grammar does not have to be perfect, saying mine isn\u2019t either, but please try, as I will too, to keep your grammar consistent.\n\nUpdates may vary depending on my schedule.\n\nNow I don\u2019t have a big story idea but I would like it to be focused on two teenagers who are possibly in love?

However I'd like to create something original this time. \n\n\nI like action, drama, and romance. I like in depth worlds. Supernatural and mystic elements are my favorites. This can be SFW or NSFW. Whatever your preference and whatever fits the roleplay. Either works for me. I can expand on the NSFW if you PM me but in a general sense I can go over what I like and want in a roleplay\n\n \nI love dark and creepy themes. I love the supernatural elements. Vampires, Elder beings, demons, gods, norse beings, and even aliens. Or something unique and original that is in between. I love world building and I am typically in first person so I'd like if you are as well but it isnt a deal breaker. \n\nLong replies are nice but its also very situational. I have a very creative mind and if you do as well that's perfect, if not, I dont mind helping to fill the gaps or really taking our time to build something exciting. I dont like doing all the leg work though. Its gotta be mutual. \n\nAs far as nsfw.. I have a list but I'd like to leave that out of this post. If you want to know more about that aspect, let me know. If not sfw is completely fine with me. \n\nFeel free to message me for my kik or discord \n\nHowever I do need a partner who is 18+ non negotiable.",

            "selftext": "This is a very loose concept, intentionally so that it may easily fit whoever steps up to the plate. What I'm after is not your typical run of the mill Skyrim story; I'd like to see two fabled adventurers, notorious and reckless as they come, who get stuck with the responsibility of parenthood. Perhaps the child is an orphan stowaway who sneaks into their cart or a bratty noble being held for ransom\u2014 regardless, they're going to be a gift-wrapped timebomb sent from the planes of Oblivion.\n\nFor the first time in their lives, our heroes will encounter a beast they can't handle. The age/gender/race of the child are undetermined, but I have some ideas outlined that I'd like a partner to help me colour. The plot would be catered to suit the established relationship between our characters, of which I can tell you a brief bit about my own. She's a self-indulgent nihilist and a cutthroat treasure hunter with a charming front. After decades of glory, gold and gore I can see her broken morals would be beginning to wear, and she'd not be able to turn up a chance of redemption like this.\n\nIdeally, I'd like a romance to grow flourish between the main characters over time\u2014 but this love won't blossom like flowers in the spring, no, these two are weeds. It'll be prickly and toxic at times, but ultimately something beautiful in it's own weird form. I'm more interested in a dynamic and dysfunctional friendship that is pushed to be something more intimate by the cruel, ironic binds of fate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI really thought I'd retired from roleplay (from Skyrim, for that matter) after some eight years I felt that I'd milked my interest to the bone, but this idea will allow me to give more life for the characters that I am so stubbornly attached to. I'd love to explore the fine print of the 'happily ever after' that we so easily dump at the end of their wild adventures.\n\nI don't like to put constraints on my post length as it depends on the pace and content of the roleplay. I think asking someone to spurt ten paragraphs about their character making a bowl of cereal is cruel, but I won't accept one liners. All I'm asking is that you be lenient with your expectations as I work twelve hour days and will cut corners occasionally. I'll do the same for you, you slacker.\n\nMy preferred roleplaying medium is Discord, I'm yet and willing to try Reddit PMs. Discord would be cool for plotting regardless because, if you haven't noticed, I talk a lot.\n\nSling me a message or drop your Discord if you're interested.",

            "selftext": " \n\nSo I don't even know how active the RP part of this fandom is anywhere outside of Tumblr. I don't have the photoshop chops or aesthetics to roleplay on that site and all others I've been on don't have any active characters in the show's universe. So yeah, I've looked almost everywhere and now I've decided to give Reddit a shot.\n\nAs mentioned in the title, I have an OC that I'm dying to use which is why I've specified 'OC friendly.' This doesn't mean I'll refuse to roleplay with other OCs, but I'm mostly hoping to find anyone playing Elliot, Darlene or even Tyrell (literally any canon would be great though). And while I prefer to primarily play my OC, I have no issue taking up one or more canons as secondary/minor characters. I tend to write better when juggling more than one character. If my OC is trash, feel free to ghost lol.\n\nNow on to length and style. I'm not really a stickler about the length of the RP. I can go from one-liner to multi-para and generally write at least a paragraph consistently. I can do meta RPs, nonlinear, AUs as weird as you can imagine, and just random chatting/texting nonsense IC. Bouncing back to the nonlinear thing, that means I'm fine roleplaying scenes out of chronological order (with some discussion of what may have happened previously of course).\n\nOn the subject of ways to play, I'm pretty flexible with wherever we end up writing as long as I can type out my replies on my laptop, though that means I can't roleplay on a platform like Kik.",

We will be heavily focusing on interpersonal relationships, roleplay drama, high-octane adventuring and all of that in space!\n\nI'm looking to build a friendly, open group full of people eager to get their Sci-Fi groove on in small, personal stories between members of a ship's crew!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***In the 24th Century CE, the far reaches of space are within the grasp of Humanity.

We're a new roleplay discord just starting out and getting our feet underneath us and we'd love it if you came to check us out!\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe story is set in January of 2019, where unrest has settled all across Earth. People have stopped dying and scientists cannot figure out why. People struck by cars, unharmed. People sick from illness suddenly recovering. It has created a pandemic across Earth. \n\nWhat's causing this? Unrest among the Heavenly Host. \n\nIn December, the presiding angel over death, Azrael, disappeared. It is believed that she was murdered by the horseman of death in collaboration with all who served under him. Now, all those responsible for escorting the dead to the afterlife have been called to heaven for questioning and there's no one left on Earth to do their jobs. \n\n**Basics**\n\nYou may play as an Angel, a human, or a demon, each with many diverse subclasses to make your character your own. Each four classes they can choose from to specialize your individual OC. \n\nWe also have optional events, meaning that they are available to those who want to participate, but not required if they're not your thing. \n\nHave I piqued your interest? If so, click the invite link to check us out!\n\n**Invite**\n\n[https://discord.gg/R2dm8Ms](https://discord.gg/R2dm8Ms)",

            "selftext": "*It started when a young boy, who, keep in mind, was sheltered, was allowed to get a Pokemon and begin his journey when he was 14. He had no friends, mainly because he was socially awkward. He was so exited to be getting his first Pokemon and going on an adventure. He followed a guy on his phone, using the only social media he had, Twitter. This boy he followed was named Ash. Ash had come from the town of Pallot, the same town Alex had lived in. Ash had became a trainer a year ago, and was almost to the Elite 4. Alex wanted the meet the Elite 4 so badly. He would give anything. He envied Ash Ketchum. Being such a cool trainer must be hard. Alex wanted the challenge. Alex, with an exited brain, thoughts rushing through it, ran towards the Professor's office.*\n\nThanks for reading this and taking time away from your day. My name is Alex. I am looking for a Pokemon Trainer romance and adventure Rp. This will take place around the same time that Ash Ketchum became a trainer, give or take a year or two. I want a partner to do this with me because it seemed like a good idea, and I used to love Pokemon. Here are the rules.\n\n1. DO NOT GHOST... I hate ghosting. If you ghost for 1 week, we are through. If you have to go on vacation or something else that will take longer that a week, notify me beforehand.\n2. Be semi- literate... Put at least one paragraph in there.\n3. Don't try to control my character a lot... if you need me to be somewhere, do that, but don't tell me that my character is doing or saying something that I did not say he was doing.\n4. Know at least a good amount about Pokemon. You don't have to be a geek, but at least try.\n5. Be kind... don't bully me. That's it.\n\nThose are all of the rules. Private message me if you are interested.",

Well, do I have the story for you. Unlike a normal DnD story where we go from weak adventurers to strong heros, I want to go from strong heros to monsters.   \nMy Idea for the story is that our group of adventurers, six strong, invade a dungeon that supposedly contains long lost \"Old God\" of Darkness and to purge it in the name of the Holy Chuch, but some of our party might know more than they let on. In turn, our heros find out the truth about the Holy Church that makes everything they thought they knew seem like a lie. How do they handle this? What happens to our valiant adventurers? That can be discussed through either DM or through Discord! I am looking for someone who can play 2-3 characters and write 2 paragraphs or more. I assure you I will write just as much and make sure to keep every scene detailed and interesting. Please do be above the age of 18 due to some gore and adult themes. Thank you!",

            "selftext": "**Forewarning: This is not a typical 1-on-1 roleplay. This is more of a project between myself and a single partner that I intend to go on for a long time! I will write as the GM (storyteller, narator, gamemaster) while my partner controls only one character, who will serve as the protagonist of the story. This will be 99% lore-abiding.**\n\nHello, all! I'm looking for an experienced writer to go through an adventure on Azeroth with me! I'm a long-time fan of the Warcraft series and lore, and I don't feel that I've ever been able to properly tell a good story in that universe. When I was a teenager, I got sucked into WoW roleplay and although it was fun, it has always lacked narrative depth. These days I can't really stand or find the time to roleplay in a game, but I still miss writing about paladins, death knights, and all manner of edginess!\n\nA bit about me: I'm a male in my twenties and I work in the real estate industry, as well as the fitness industry (as a trainer and an aspiring competitor). I work a minimum of 45 hours per week at my first job, and generally about 10-20 at my other one. With that in mind, I'm **very** busy. Despite that, I am going to be one of the most frequently responding partners that you will ever have! Even if it's from my phone, and it takes me half of an hour to type it out, you should probably expect six to twelve responses (each with multiple paragraphs) from me **per day**. Aside from that, I live with my SO and do spend my evenings with her, so you'll probably get most responses from me throughout the day-time.\n\nHere are some things I'm looking for in a partner:\n\n* Experience. Not necessarily with roleplaying, but with writing. There is an endless amount of people that brag about their 2-20 years of roleplaying experience but can't but together a proper sentence or complex character. While I'm patient, I only have time for one partner and I'd love someone that can match my writing skills, relatively.\n\n* Curiosity &amp; Creativity. As a GM, I love telling stories. What I hate is partners who want to have their hand held the entire time. I want a partner who wants to challenge me as a GM and find loopholes left and right. If you find a locked door in an abandoned castle, don't just walk away, break it down or pick the lock! I very much like to describe roleplaying with me as like a text-based deep roleplaying game where anything is possible (as long as it fits the confines as the universe).\n\n* Quality &amp; Quantity. This is where I lose some potential partners, *and that's okay*. I prefer to have a partner that can respond at least half of a dozen times per day, if not significantly more. Similarly, I like posts to have a lot of effort in them too! I'll most likely spend about five to fifteen minutes on each of my responses, sometimes far more. Quality makes a good story, but I believe quantity (of responses) is what keeps people interested for a long period of time and fuels the narative significantly! Of course, life does take priority and as long as you can give me a warning, I don't mind waiting for a while for you to take care of the important things.\n\n* A friend. Writing together is great, but it can get stale if it's with a stranger, in my opinion. I'm not saying let's meet up and have lunch, but a little out-of-character chat is always appreciated!\n\nThat aside, I have a few ideas for the story arc. If you've gotten this far and you're still interested, please include your favorite Warcraft character in your message! My basic ideas for a plot are:\n\n* A vanilla adventure, starting not long after the third war, and slowly progressing up to the Shadowlands era. This would be a long story with a lot of mini-arcs, and probably weeks or (more likely) months of writing. However, this would be a great way to have a customized story tailored to your character from the days of the Alliance-Horde War, to Arthas, to Deathwing, and to the Legion. We would most likely include some time-skips as well!\n\n* A Fourth War Plot. The Fourth War begins in the Mists of Pandaria Expansion and ends in the Battle For Azeroth expansion. This would focus directly on the conflicts between the Alliance and Horde.\n\n* The Northrend Invasion. My knowledge is a bit more limited of the Wrath timeline, but I thought it would be interested to do a storyline that runs throughout Northrend and leads to the fall of The Lich King.\n\n* An apprentice story. Maybe your character is an apprentice in Dalaran, or a new recruit to the Silver Hand. It would be a nice story about a young character that follows them through their early days of adventure and into one of the plots listed above!\n\n* A smaller than life story. What I mean by this is that the storyline doesn't have to revolve around apocalyptic events. The events with Arthas and the Legion and Old Gods will happen, sure, but who says your character has to be apart of them? Want to just be a Kul Tiran pirate? Or perhaps a soldier in the Barrens?\n\nAnything is possible and I am open to just about any possible storyline as long as it doesn't contradict canon!\n\nOne final thing that I'd like to add is that even though you control a character and I act as the GM, I see every character, except yours, as my own character! I pour an immense amount of effort into my characters so that they feel like lovable (or hateable) people on your character's journey. I aim for them to breathe life onto the world and create something memorable. Furthermore, I will only ever use canon characters as a necessity, and I keep it to a bare minimum. \n\nThank you for reading and please let me know if you're interested or have any questions! :)",

            "selftext": "Hello there everyone! With the excitement of Sword and Shield, I\u2019m finding myself wanting to do some sort of journey roleplay! This would be similar to the games, but with a romance element to it! Maybe different choices? Or maybe we take a bachelor/bachelorette spin on it? Or do we focus on two characters\u2019 relationship? I\u2019m pretty open as long as you can play canon guys! This will be M x F (with my character as F) or M x M. I will be playing original characters. \n\n\ud83d\udd34\u26aa\ufe0fRules~\ud83d\udd34\u26aa\ufe0f\n\n1. Please be a literate person that can hold a reply. You do not need to give me a book, but I expect more than a few sentences. \n\n2. 3rd person please, no 1st! Sorry, not my thing! \n\n3. Be active, do not ghost! If you aren\u2019t feeling our plot, let\u2019s start a new one or part ways! Communication is key with me. \n\n4. Please be 18+. I\u2019m 20 something, and roleplaying with anyone younger than this just feels... weird. \n\n5. If you cannot play canon characters, I unfortunately will have to decline your offer. I am happy to include original characters, however I really want there to be canon love interests in this as well. \n\nIf interested, shoot me a PM! Thank you for reading and have a wonderful day!",

            "selftext": "***All content in the post below is intended for ages 18 and above, aka 18+.***\n\n**This will be a persistent request I will repost on a near-regular basis. I don't check Reddit often during the day, but I check it daily. Whoever I am playing with, do not take it personally. It's just habit.**\n\nFirst, a few things about myself.\n\n33 years old, Eastern Time Zone U.S.A. (GMT -4 for international folks), full time weekday, 40 hours a week, worker. Craving RP with any and all interested.\n\n*Please don't be discouraged by everything here. Some things did require more context to make sense, especially The Catch section. The best we can do is try with each other. :)*\n\n***Basic Requirements and Options***\n\nThird person RP only, Discord is a must because my computer AND phone use it.\n\nWhat I seek is female characters (IRL gender does NOT matter) opposite any of my males/females/anything in between. In what, you may ask? Look below (anything in bold is a big want with me):\n\n\\-Modern (includes fantasy, **slice of life, drama. I love the whole \"love, marriage, baby carriage\" angle in any relationship I do in a story**).\n\n\\-Historical (Medieval (specifically vikings/Norse/Saxon/Crusades/Plantagenet/Tudors era), Victorian/Wild West eras, **1940s/1950s/1960s play**)\n\n\\-Fantasy (this goes into either of the genres above and can account for any of the fandoms below if we do something within those worlds)\n\n\\-Fandoms (Marvel/DC including Arrowverse/DCAU, Once Upon a Time, **Star Wars**, **Game of Thrones aka A Song of Ice and Fire**, Peaky Blinders, **Harry Potter/Fantastic Beasts/Wizarding World,** Vikings, The Last Kingdom, **The Boys**; **Friday Night Lights).** Anime is in here too, though that includes Code Geass, Gundam, Fullmetal Alchemist, the Shonen Jump stuff...Others are open to ask on. Canon characters are a big toss up, so ask on them if you come my way asking to play someone. Bring a few ideas if I say no, just in case.\n\n***Writing and RP Style***\n\nAs for visuals, I have gotten dependent on them. Superficial, lacking imagination on images? It is. But I've played in public SLs over the years who have regularly embraced them, so it's ingrained on me. Usually, actors/actresses/models and the occasional art. I have some to offer if any are open to them.\n\nI favor adult writing and want the same from who I play with. No FADE TO BLACK. PERIOD. Give me the romantic, intimate, and everything beyond it in detail (those that know what this means will get it :) ). I also enjoy players who like to talk OOC.\n\n***The catch?***\n\nI got it down to three simple statements:\n\n1. As often as I am on Discord, even I will have moments of AFK. But I will be around daily, wanting to play a good RP. Ideally, I want someone who fits in the same boat, who can be on and roleplay often.\n2. I love those who are open minded or don't let anything bother them. If I say or do something that you don't agree with, then just say so. I know I will, and we can either work it out or move on.\n3. I don't want to deal with any ghosters or flaky people. If we work out an idea together, whether I contact you or vice versa, I want to stay on top of things with you as much as possible. If RL comes up and you have to go, I get it if you let me know. If anyone is silent without notice for a week, I'll move on and let them contact me at their convenience.\n\n***Conclusion***\n\nFeel free to PM me for my Discord name or offer yours (with the 4 digit number at the end) when you message (no need to wait!). I apologize for the long winded post, but it's the best I can do. **Any interested folks who PM me, please throw in a \"marvelous\" somewhere so I know my post was read rather than the title**. :) I look forward to meeting everyone!\n\n***All content in the post above is intended for ages 18 and above, aka 18+.***",

I am a graduate student and I work, so I don\u2019t have a lot of free time for a lot of partners. \n\nRules (kind of?):\n\n* 18+: Please please please, be over the age of 18. I work in education. While we may not end up writing anything NSFW, should it lean that way I want to know that I won\u2019t lose my job. I will check your history and if anything seems fishy, I won\u2019t rp with you. Please don\u2019t lie to me. \n* I don\u2019t like having to write hugely long replies. I do more than one liners, but usually only a small paragraph unless the scene calls for more. If you want to go all out and write a huge reply, go for it. I won\u2019t try and match your length though. And you don\u2019t have to match mine if I end up writing something long. As long as it\u2019s more than a one liner, we\u2019re good. \n* I only write 3rd person.\n* I can\u2019t reply a lot and I don\u2019t reply quickly. Sometimes I am available to focus solely on the roleplay for a while, but not usually. I try to give a reply a day, but there is no guarantee. \n* I am EST in the US. I\u2019m usually awake from 9am-12am, but some days I have to get up at 6am. My replies will probably usually come before noon. \n* I don\u2019t care about what gender you are, but I am only looking for people writing guys right now. \n* Please have at least moderate writing skills. If you end up writing like a man who has never even seen a woman or a 12 year old who just discovered fan fiction, I\u2019m not going to want to roleplay with you. \n\nAs far as plot goes, I have a spoiled brat prince character that I\u2019m wanting to play. The genre would be fantasy as he has magic abilities. I have a fairly detailed character chart for him, so if you are interested in seeing the whole thing, feel free to ask. I want it to be set in a medieval-esque time period, but it doesn\u2019t have to be perfectly accurate; it is a fantasy after all. I definitely want romance. I don\u2019t have a specific plot in mind, so you can play whatever kind of character you want and we can imagine how it goes from there. Maybe you want to be a very obliging servant, maybe you want to be a hard headed knight, whatever you think would fit best. Please send me what type of character you want to play and maybe a small writing sample? It doesn\u2019t have to be anything huge, it can just be something like a rp beginning you did before or something. If you want to see Leon\u2019s character sheet first, that\u2019s fine too! Please message me with a PM and not a chat, I never check those.",

I've recently immersed myself back into the FF series (especially 14), and I'd just love to find a partner or more to create a wonderful story with me!\n\nWhile I am fine with any part of the series, I'd much rather play an OC. However you're more than welcome to go canon with your character!\n\nRomance is encouraged, but not necessary. I would ask that you let me know what you're seeking out as I'm open to a short term casual thing or a long term plot heavy story. Any gender/race works for me!\n\nI won't be able to respond at specific times, but as long as you don't mind being patient then I'll get back to you! I also don't mind if you need to take breaks due to life happening. \n\nLooking forward to hearing from you! I'm sure we can make an awesome story together!",

The angels protect the good people and bring them good luck. The angels are also suppose to bring thehumans who pray to the deity they believe in, what they pray for if it's in good hopes. The demons are sent to make sinners pay and work them after death. Though not all demons are bad, nor are all angels good.\n\nLucifer, he is truly horrible. He had kept peace with the city of light for many years but decided to send over one of his  dark knights, then another, then an army. Forcing angels to fight back for their home, a war broke out. Some coward away on earth, some seeked peace. One specimen (angel or demon) decided to try and recruit other demons and angels to try and redeem peace once more in hopes of stopping the chaos.\nIf there are any questions about the plot or about the other ones (if you want to hear them) feel free to ask.\nDM me if you're interested, of course.

            "selftext": "After the Cult of Trump Bombing of 2032, the Floods of 2048, and the Great Departure of 2077, each state broke away and clans began to form between new leaders, prophets, and criminals. It is the year 2094 and the Twelve-Year War ended with a consolidation of 5 territories: Cascadia, United States of Mormon, Minerva, The Southern Confederacy, and Northern Alliance. While most of the land was barren except for closest to the major cities of each territory, raider gangs, cults, and lawless collectives made the desserts their home and kept travelers on their toes. This is a story about those that still hear the call to adventure and traverse the cracked highways of yesterday\u2026\n\nA fusion lance went straight through the rear axle of the armored SUV and made it swerve right into a lighter car next to it. The questing knight steadied their lancer for another round and revved their Tesla-Z motorcycle forward towards the target vehicle. Their ebony armor glistened in the sun against the ageing asphalt of Interstate 80 as they swerved through debris to get in position behind the leader\u2019s battlewagon and a local woman whose family had enough to cover the knight\u2019s fee. This time the knight would need to only disable the vehicle without harming anyone inside, and with a press of a trigger the battlewagon\u2019s battery cut off and lost all power to its engine. Holstering their lancer and pulling up behind another destroyed vehicle, the knight hopped off their machine and expanded their prism stone halberd, \u201cErick, if you give up the girl, then you and the rest of your men can walk away from this.\u201d\n\n\u201cFuck you! I will rip off that helmet from your body and skull fuck you until you are unrecognizable.\u201d He shot a few rounds towards the knight, but without a clear line of sight Erick wasn\u2019t going to be hitting anyone any time soon.\n\nThe next few moments flowed as if the knight had choreographed them for months, as they leapt from their cover and charged at the raider leader and his two remaining men. The first didn\u2019t even have time to see what happened as the halberd sliced through his Kevlar jacket but at least the second had time to at least pop a shot at the knight. Unfortunately for the second one, his bullet crumbled into the QPE armor and fell to the floor as the knight\u2019s halberd swung through his neck. \n\nErick lunged at the knight with a power sword and just barely connected with the knight's left bicep, cutting through his armour and drawing blood. Dropping their left arm, the knight swung at Erick and sliced his sword hand clean off. Erick fell to his knees and held onto the bleeding stump that used to be where his had was before the knight stood before him and drew a revolver from his side, \"In the name of the Lady and all those that you have harmed, I shall cast you into the Darkness.\" The knight paused before pulling the trigger and watched as Erick's limp body fell to the floor and brain matter began to ooze out of the fresh hole. He watched as the blood began to trickle into the cracks of the asphalt and some bugs could already be seen creeping to their unexpected dinner.\n\nScanning to see if anyone else was around, the knight lifted off their helmet to reveal a masculine, light terra-cotta face framed with espresso ringlets. A few tattoos lined his face that told a story of who he was for those that knew the old ways, and his warm, jade eyes began to soften as he saw all the danger around his had been culled. His tall, toned body strode to the disabled battlewagon and knocked on the only partly open back door, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m here to take you back to your family in one piece.\u201d He opened the back door the rest of the way to reveal\u2026\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nHi! My name is Dylan and I\u2019m interested in doing a twist on a post-apocalyptic style scene. It can be done in 1st or 3rd person, and I would prefer to do this over Kik, Discord, or email. I\u2019m looking for this to be about 70% story and 30% smut, but the smut should only really happen when it makes sense. Please respond with thoughts on how you would like the story to progress or what you would want to add to the back story of the world partially developed.",

            "selftext": "Hey,\n\nfirst of all thanks for reading my post, I guess my headline was interesting enough xD. To get to the point I am really looking forward to doing a Star Wars romance roleplay. I am a huge Star Wars fan especially the EU (Legends) and would love to find a partner who is into that as well. My favorite Star Wars eras are either the clone wars, the dark times (between Episode 3 and 4), the Kotor games or the old republic. Personally I sadly dislike Episode 7 and 8 which is why I don't want to have the rp set in that era. If you like that I am happy for you but this might not be the roleplay you are looking for so ... move along.\n\nSome ideas I've had which could be interesting, of course, we can also always use an idea you have:\n\nImperial Spy x Rebel  \nSet during the dark times an Imperial Spy managed to get into a Rebel Cell, constantly sending reports about their activities. One day she gets put into a squad with some other rebels. One of them, in particular, is really interesting to her and she eventually falls in love with her. Now she is conflicted with her duty to the empire and her love for the rebel.\n\nJedi x Bounty hunter\n\nThis would be set during the clone wars. At the end of the clone wars, the republic gets desperate using more and more bounty hunters and smugglers for their purposes. A young Jedi is forced to team up with one of those Bounty hunters. She at first really dislikes the idea of working with basic criminals. Luckily for her, the bounty hunter is there during Order 66 and saves her from some of her fellow clones. After that, they are on their own and eventually a romantic relationship develops, while they try to find their place in this reformed galaxy.\n\nSith master x Dark Jedi  \nWar has broken out during the old republic. One young prodigy padawan, always finishing exams and trials as the class best, has enough of stupid training. Especially since a war just started so she steals herself onto a battleship that is heading from Tython towards a war zone. This ship is being attacked by a Sith fleet. The crew get's killed including the Jedi Master in command. The Sith Lord leading the attack breaks the young Jedi. She becomes a dark Jedi seeing reason in the Sith philosophy and understanding that they are not just demons because they use their emotions to their advantage. Now being the apprentice of the sith lord they grow closer and eventually become lovers as well.\n\nWell, I hope we will roleplay soon just message me on Reddit don't be shy &lt;3.\n\nAnd remember may the force be with you ... always.\n\n(Palpatine voice) No ... Noooo ... fulfill your destiny ...",

            "selftext": " \n\nLush is a discord roleplayer community that offers a world in which resides a wide array of fantastical beings. We are first and foremost a mature community of 18+ literate roleplayers looking to add more quality writers to this world! We write anywhere from novella to a minimum of paragraph length, offer clean organised OOC chats, and a team of dedicated and responsive staff.\n\nEven though our lore is fairly extensive, it is split in a way to ease access for new characters in must-read and optional sections. We welcome original characters who are looking for a natural progression through Lush be it through learning magic, acquiring magical items or accessing high society in a moderated way.\n\nHere's the pitch : \"Lush, a magocracy established in the eye of what the council named 'The mist'. A complex, self-sufficient chain of guild-ruled mega districts. It floats amongst a dense fog, held by magically powered devices lining the city's edges. Since it is made of an agglomeration of different districts connected by large magical bridges, there isn't a direct way in, or out of it. Anyone that comes or leaves must be either summoned, or banished by a mage. The arcane arts play a major role in the life of nearly all of its inhabitants, and while tech in itself was never really let aside.. most innovations combine a certain amount of engineering, and spellcrafting. As a result, Lush is stuck in an era of its own, replacing most of today's convenience with magical means, yet dropping any significant tech past the medieval era in the process \\[...\\]\"\n\nIf you are interested, here's the invite link: [https://discord.gg/hQVRyZd](https://discord.gg/hQVRyZd)",

            "selftext": "Hello! My name is Katie. I\u2019m 24 years old, on Eastern Standard Time. I write 350-500 words per post and 1-2 posts a day mostly. In a bit of a weird spot in my life so I may be a bit flakier but always communicative. I write in Reddit PMs, Discord, or Google Docs. I like to chatter OOC. I'd like this roleplay to be a bit darker and serious. I'm sorry if this seems direct and short! I just have an itch to scratch. \n\nI\u2019m interested in a royalty/drama/romance/political intrigue roleplay. I wrote a quick flavor text sort-of intro to give you a feel. My thoughts are I would play a newly crowned queen stepping into a world of chaos. I left the setting vague because I think this would be at any point in time: anything from medieval to modern day Your character could be anything in the world: her royal advisor, a childhood friend, a knight/bodyguard, anything. I\u2019m down to plan. You\u2019ll notice in the small flavor text below I left your role vague because I wanna work this out with you and plan something we\u2019re excited about together. \n\nDM me if you\u2019re interested!\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe throne was still warm from where her father sat earlier this morning. It felt too big for her, like the times she would sit and play pretend as a young girl. She knew she would find herself ascending the throne one day. She had prepared academically for this moment, well versed in etiquette and politics, geography and economics. On paper, she was ready to rule. \n\nBut as she glanced out over the crowd, holding their breath anxiously, her eyes were drawn to a specific spot, like magic. Her stomach churned. A bit of blood still stained the floor from the morning\u2019s assassination of the king, yet there had been no time to mourn. The kingdom needed a ruler, and the heir must be sworn in right away. \n\nOutside the walls, the kingdom was in turmoil. The loyalists mourned for their king, the gears in the machine of rebellion began to turn. A new leader meant uncertainty, new opportunities, a chance to wrestle control into their own hands.\n\nThe head of the church led her through the coronation ceremony solemnly, his voice still low from the funeral earlier that day. Her mother held back tears, doing her best to keep a stoic face for her daughter, knowing directly after this that she'd have to return to funeral arrangements while the new Queen was rushed through her last minute duties.\n\nA coronation should be a grand affair, a celebration. Instead, a tone of sadness filled the room, a rush to finish the ceremony and recognize their ruler took the pageantry out of it. The public coronation would happen after appropriate mourning, but the country needed a leader now. \n\nAnd just like that, the ceremony was over. The crown was placed on the new Queen's head. The room broke into strained applause. A false smile spread across her lips, one that only the male in the back of the room would recognize as a facade.\n\nHow could anyone be happy at a time like this? And how could anyone look forward to the time to come?",

            "selftext": "Hello there! The name\u2019s Ruben! Before I get into things, I\u2019d like to stress that I have taken a long hiatus from roleplaying, and I\u2019ve only recently decided to get back to it, so I might be a little rusty. With that in mind, some good advice and constructive criticisms are more than welcome. I\u2019m in EST (Eastern Time Zone) and I\u2019d prefer a partner that shares the same time zone with me. It would make things much easier for me. I\u2019d also prefer that\u2019s older than 18 years of age, as most of my roleplays contain NSFW themes not suitable for minors.\n\nI had an idea for a roleplay, and I\u2019ve been sitting on it for a while now. My idea for the roleplay revolves around two strangers who became pen pals after finding each other on the internet. In the spirit of the upcoming holidays, I decided to make this a Christmas themed roleplay, wherein our characters have decided to meet up in real life after months of getting to know each other online. My goal with this is to make a slow-burn roleplay where the two strangers who have become fast friends start developing romantic feelings to each other. As a fair warning, this roleplay will include some smut. A scenario like this has rarely been done on here, so I feel like this could be an interesting/fun idea to roleplay!\n\nI\u2019m a stickler for grammar, spelling, and proper punctuation. I\u2019m looking for partners that can write complete, coherent sentences. I understand typos may come up at any time, so I won\u2019t be too worried about those, but try to keep them at a minimum. I\u2019ve ended roleplays because of this before. I don\u2019t care too much about how many sentences you write, as long as your descriptive enough. I\u2019m all about quality over quantity. \n\nWell, I guess that\u2019s enough for this ad. We can discuss more in-depth details through messages if you\u2019d like. I look forward to hearing from all of you soon! Thank you!",

By this, I mean failed experiments that have escaped, objects of interest in the wrong hands, among other specifics.\n\nThe setting, theme, and general idea is heavily inspired by the works of the SCP wiki. Although we won\u2019t use the SCP Foundation as our setting, and we won\u2019t use any SCP\u2019s in the roleplay, note that it is still heavily influenced by it. I\u2019ve taken inspiration from other works for later encounters you will have, but that\u2019d be spoiling stuff.\n\nAnyways, the structure of our roleplay will go: you get an assignment, we lengthily play it out, repeat. You may be asked to report back to headquarters. There will be recurring characters and such. As we go on, a couple assignments will question your morality a *lot* concerning the Government, which may lead to our ending, however it goes. But that\u2019s a *long* way away.\n\nI\u2019m not interested in stats with this, we both know that your character won\u2019t die to the second encounter. But this is more about the story and your choices. \n\nI don\u2019t mind if you roleplay in first or third person, but I\u2019ll play in third.\n\nI live in Britain, so if you abide by a European timezone that\u2019d be preferable but I\u2019d not necessary.\n\nHope to hear from you soon!",

            "selftext": "*She was a prize, a trophy, a sign of humanity's triumph over that which was seen as unnatural - their ability to tame that which would strike them down. At least, that's what most people seemed to think. In truth she wasn't much less human than they in terms of her thoughts, desires and feelings, really in most ways. Except for her appearance.*\n\n*A long, slender, scaled tail. Horns sprouting from atop her head. Scales running over parts of her otherwise totally normal skin. And of course; a pair of strong wings, perfectly capable of carrying her weight through the skies.*\n\n*By all means she was a normal human girl aside from those draconic features  and yet to most of humanity it made her something to be feared; a monster, for lack of a better word. But one nobleman \"tamed\" her, not that she ever gave up ideas of freedom, but what with her under constant watch from the guards, how was she exactly meant to do that.*\n\n*And so there she was, dolled up and playing the act of the tamed little dragon girl, at another social event for the nobility. Once again a trophy, a bragging point for her \"master\" of which she desired nothing more than to see his demise despite her otherwise docile nature... Perhaps, on this night, things may finally change.*\n\n(Hello there! Been a while since i've had a good, long-term story based RP, and this idea's been mulling around in my head for a little while now. You probably got the basic gist of it, but basically i'll be playing as a part dragon girl (human in every way except the features mentioned) who is basically a prisoner to her \"owner\". The setting would be a fantasy one set in the 1800's; so expect that kind of level of tech and such! But of course given it's a fantasy setting it could really go anywhere, and i'm totally down for including some steampunk themes and such.)\n\n(As for who you may be, well that's up to you! Perhaps you're a rival nobleman who wishes simply to see his rival shut up for once, stealing me away just for that reason. Maybe you're someone assigned to guard me who feels sympathetic, perhaps you're even just a commoner working as a lowly butler or some such during an event like this, hurt by how unhappy i clearly am. Or perhaps you're some sort of robin hood-type hero, the kind that steals from the rich and gives to the poor. Your character is entirely up to you! Those are just a few ideas to maybe help out :) )\n\n(If you're interested, send a message! But please don't use the reddit messenger thing; i honestly never check it. I prefer to play on discord too but i can play here if need be! Message with a little idea of what kinda character you'd play and we can discuss from there!)",

            "selftext": "Welcome, welcome to City 12\n\n**Join here:** [**https://discord.gg/QhgmBeE**](https://discord.gg/QhgmBeE)\n\n\\-----\n\n Are you an experienced roleplayer in search of an exciting new community? Do you enjoy creative writing, character development and thrilling plots? Or are you perhaps looking to meet new friends that value your creativity and welcome your ideas?\n\nHere a City 12, we aim to provide an open and welcoming roleplaying community, where player freedom and creative expression is valued above all else.\n\nSet within the Half Life 2 universe, City 12 offers a unique roleplaying platform that caters to all. With the help of our community, we hope to create a living, experience like no other.\n\nWhether you are an experienced Half Life 2 Roleplayer, or are new to the genre; you will find inside a series of helpful guides to help immerse you in this dynamic world that we hope you will soon become a part of.\n\n\\-----\n\n**What can I roleplay?**\n\nPretty much anything you like. City 12 is a mature roleplaying community, set within the bleak alternative world of Half Life 2. A unique dystopia, HL2 is a world in which humanity suffers beneath a heartless and unknowable alien regime, popularly known as the Combine. The remnants of humanity have been herded into the last remaining cities on earth, watched over by an oppressive and cruel police-state. Stripped of their former names, and of all historic significance, these cities are soulless and dreary places of hard labour and austerity.\n\n**Citizens**\n\nDressed in plain uniforms of cheap denim, citizens lead an existence rife with danger. Life is cheap and hard, ever under the watchful gaze of the Combine, citizens have to face a daily routine of hard labour and empty stomachs. Yet despite the untold hardship, mankind endures.\n\n**Civil Protection**\n\nThe path that leads to ordinary men and women joining Civil Protection is often intimately complex, none the less when they put on that sinister mask, they become merely another unit in the Combine\u2019s hated arsenal of repression. With near total impunity, units of Civil Protection can often be found praying on the helpless citizenry of City 12. Like playground bullies with guns, any sense of morality or justice soon fades from any would be recruit. With improved rations and power over their peers, the life of a Civil Protection unit is measurably preferable to that of your average citizen.\n\n**Civil Workers Union**\n\nMembers of the Civil Workers Union are the cogs that keep the machine turning. Managers, administrators and landlords, these individuals help to keep the various factories, offices and housing blocks of City 12 running. Although considered of higher status than the average citizen, members of the CWU are no less at the mercy of Civil Protection. Yet to combat this risk and often to hide their self-serving corruption, CWU members are often amongst the most enthusiastic of informers, happy to sell out their fellow man to save their own skin.\n\n**Criminal elements**\n\nAs ordered and repressive as City 12 society may be, the streets are no less free of crime as any other sprawling ghetto. From petty theft to serious organised crime, many nefarious individuals peddle their dark trade throughout the lesser patrolled areas of City 12. From gangs to serial killers, one would well advised to obey the curfew and avoid the seedier parts of town.\n\n**Resistance**\n\nNot all residents of City 12 are content to lay down and accept Combine rule. Many a brave soul has attempted to take a stand against the oppressive regime, yet few survive for long. To become an Anti-citizen is to accept that your death is inevitable, for as stalwart and just as your cause may be, the infinite tendrils of the Universal Union will slowly but surely wrap around your throat, one day Civil Protection will find you. Yet despite the seemingly futile situation, hope still exists for the brave few that take up the mantle of resistance. Expect no help, expect no glory, expect no mercy.\n\n**Aliens**\n\nA decade before the Combine invasion, following the Black Mesa incident in the early 2000s, mankind was faced with the stark truth that mankind is not alone. From the simple yet terrifying headcrab, to the sentient Vortigaunts, City 12 is home to many creatures that are not of this world.\n\n \\-----\n\nAlthough we would ask that you to respect the source material, player freedom is at the very heart of City 12. So if you are looking to join a new and exciting roleplay community, then look no further!\n\n**Join here:** [**https://discord.gg/QhgmBeE**](https://discord.gg/QhgmBeE)",

            "selftext": "First of all, a bit about me. I am an experienced, mature RPer who has a number of years of experience in different formats, including face-to-face, email, forums and the like. Primarily, I am interested in character interaction and development, especially through storytelling, conversation and relationship building. I like to see well developed, well thought out and believable characters. I prefer exotic or unusual settings, primarily science fiction, cyberpunk or post-apocalyptic. \u201cReal world/slice of life\u201d scenarios aren\u2019t that interesting to me; if it's something like a military or espionage setting, maybe, but not something 'mundane'. With that being said, I\u2019m open to ideas if they\u2019re original or creative or a little unusual.\n\nI generally like well-written, well thought out posts, and definitely prefer quality over quantity. I don\u2019t want to read a novel with each post, but I don\u2019t want to see one-line-wonders. Similarly, I am a stickler for grammar and spelling and punctuation, although I am prone to the odd bout of ferocious typos myself. However, as long as the intent is there, then I\u2019m happy.\n\nMy interests lie in mutual storytelling and creativity, rather than playing along to somebody else\u2019s story or the like. I control my character, I decide what\u2019s going on with them, I create their background and so on. I ask for my partners to respect that, as I will do the same for them. Likewise, I will never launch a major story element or a plot twist or the like without okaying it with a partner, as I would expect them to do the same for me. If I do something a partner doesn't want, then I'll gladly change it, but I ask that they will do the same for me.\n\nWhat I am looking for at the moment is a Roleplay set in the **Star Wars** universe. I am fairly open to ideas, settings, characters and stories, although I also have a few of my own that I am happy to discuss with a partner. All I am asking is that the RP feature entirely original characters; I'm not interested in playing (or playing against) canon characters.\n\nPlease note that I am **only** looking for a Star Wars themed RP at the moment. Likewise, I am **only** looking for a one-to-one RP\n\nIf you are interested, please contact me by **PM**. I will not reply to messages posted here or chat requests.",

            "selftext": "We are looking for dedicated, chatty, fun members to join our small group roleplay. We are a **BRAND NEW** roleplay, so you've not missed out on anything yet!\n\n**All is not actually well at Pandora Wellness &amp; Rehabilitation Facility.**\n\n**Not a single soul can see in. And not one single soul can see outside of those big, black gates. You can dream about it, sure. But you definitely can't even think about doing it. Because your hospital chip will sense that via your heart rate, way before you even think about making a move.**\n\n**Pandora Wellness &amp; Rehabilitation Facility, most commonly used by the 'messed up rich kids', is essentially a 5* luxury hotel, featuring it's own state-of-the-art sports centre, latest spa treatments, world-class cuisine, and your own specialist doctors? Sounds like a once in a lifetime offer to change your life.**\n\n**Which is exactly what that is.**\n\n**A lifetime offer.**\n\n**Once you're in Pandora, the likelihood is that you will never return to your real home.**\n\n**On the surface, it appears that all the residents of Pandora have an amazing life set up for them whilst they are there. The majority come from wealthy families \u2013 the few that don't are usually there on a 'gifted programme'. Their 'suites' are set up with materialistic things. They have personalised tuition, and they more often than not end up with a bunch of friends. Sounds great, right?**\n\n**Wrong.**\n\n**Pandora is filled with rules. Many, many rules. And if you're caught breaking a rule, it's not even worth your life. Punishments are given. They start simple, like no phone privileges, or no 'treat' with your evening meal. But they soon move on, to physical and emotional punishments.**\n\n**Doctor Huntley, known as Hunter amongst the patients \u2013 due to his predatory nature, is the main psychologist and the 'leader' of Pandora. Hunter uses his influence to control and intimidate not only the patients, but the staff also. Everything to do with Pandora is organised and controlled by Hunter.**\n\n**Everything.**\n\n**Food intake, daily exercise, water allowance, the books and movies they are allowed to have access to, the times they're allowed to do these things. Internet access is restricted to their own server, in which every social media website is blocked. Most internet searches are blocked. Pretty much the only thing you can do, is buy 'pre-approved' items from Pandora's official 'shopping page'. This features a small selection of books, movies, clothing items, sports equipment and stationary. And to be able to shop, you have to earn 'credits'. These can be earned by good behaviour, achieving targets, helping out when required and making all of your grades. These credits can also be put towards your spa treatments and a 'weekly treat', which you can choose from a low fat chocolate bar, or a bag of rice crisps.**\n\n**All of these things are logged on the official Pandora 'bracelet'. Use that term loosely \u2013 it's not exactly a fashion accessory. It's more of a 'chip' combined with an Apple watch. Hunter, and all other staff members can see what's recorded on the chip. Daily weigh ins, your calorific intake and the exact food you've eaten. The time you took your medicines, the things you've purchased. Your sleeping hours, your restless hours. Your heart-rate. Your specific location at all times. It's all stored right in there. And what's not stored in your bracelet is all seen on security cameras. The place is littered with them. There's at least 200 cameras on site, even in the bathrooms.**\n\n**Very, very, very rarely patients can be taken outside of Pandora. Only to specialised appointments, or family visits. These are chaperoned by 3 staff to 1 patient, to reduce the risk of a 'runner'.**\n\n**Some patients have tried to break out. It's resulted in them being locked in 'Maxx'. The maximum security wards. Chained to a bed and tube fed. Mentally tortured with pictures, videos, sounds of things that scare them the most. Every once in a while, Hunter will do a 'visit' with all of the patients, to see those locked in Maxx. It's usually enough to scare anybody else from trying it.**\n\n**Will you try it? \ud83d\udc80**\n\n*Please send me a PM for a link if you\u2019re interested! We\u2019re a very small group, so we\u2019re looking for people who are dedicated &amp; interested in writing and being around. We get that everybody has a life &amp; commitments, don\u2019t worry!*\n\nPlease be aware of the fact that:\n\n1)We plot &amp; chat on discord, but write on a forum.\n\n2)REAL LIFE FACE CLAIMS MUST BE USED. (Singers, actors, musicians etc. No anime or drawings allowed.)\n\nThanks so much! Hope to hear from some of you all soon!\n\nB. x",

            "selftext": "I\u2019m not sure if this is the right place for this, but I\u2019m going to post it here anyway. I\u2019m a writer, messing around with a big project. (I\u2019m not famous and you don\u2019t know me!) I have an idea for an epic fantasy story and there\u2019s one plot line that I\u2019m really wrestling with. I think that what I\u2019d like to do is maybe role play it with some of you to see what I can do with the plotline. \n\nMY CHARACTER: Captain Clay Jones, 28, Captain of the 3rd Horse. (I am going to use a generic name for him because I don\u2019t want my nomenclature to get in your way!)\nHandsome, dashing, athletic, Jones is a model officer with very little in the way of ambition but sort of has some of it thrust upon him by his family. His oldest brother is being groomed to take their father\u2019s place in the Senate while his other brother is a powerful coutier/social climber/equivalent of a media mogul. He also has an older sister that is a wildly successful actress and a younger sister that is just attending university. He is the military son and needs to succeed to help everyone around him. Jackson was a good student at the \u201cacademy\u201d and has advanced quickly. He\u2019s charismatic and well liked by his command staff and his men. Superior officers like him because he thinks of the men first. \n\nYOUR CHARACTER: Captain Whatever You Name Her, 28, Captain of the 6th Horse.\nI\u2019m keeping this wide open, physically, personality and background wise. I have a name in mind for her, but I don\u2019t want to stand in the way of what you want to do with her. It\u2019s literally all up to you. I have some ideas but I\u2019m stalling so maybe you can help. You can create her any way you like. There\u2019s very little I\u2019m going to shut down. The only requirements that I have is that she is a high competent warrior and battle commander. Her soldiers respect her and follow her commands without question, but you can decide the whys and the hows of her command style. Also, I\u2019d like for her to have a signature weapon. I really don\u2019t care what it is, but she is known for that weapon. Other than that, the character is yours to do what you want with.\n\nPLOT: We are officers in an invading army, commanding two units of cavalry. We\u2019ve known each other since the \u201cacademy\u201d where we were intense rivals. After graduation we were assigned to the same unit but distinguished ourselves quickly, moving up the ranks. The invasion, which is of questionable legality, is a chance for us to make our names. We clash often during strategy meetings and our forces argue and brawl frequently. The general worries that we do more damage than good sometimes, but on the battlefield there is no question of our value. We even work well together in battle.\n\nThe catch is that we are having an intense affair. It\u2019s mostly physical but there is an obvious attraction between the two characters. We can explore how that grows and changes, if it does at all. I\u2019ve thought of making Jones engaged or married and you can make the woman character married or single. It\u2019ll be one of the things we deal with as the story moves on. I don\u2019t have anything plotted out yet, just a general idea of how the story is going to move forward. I want the focus to be on the relationship between our two characters, their interactions with their troops and some battle experiences. We can flesh that out later. There's an opportunity for you to play more than one character here as well in addition to the female captain. You really have lots of freedom. \n\nThe world isn\u2019t set in stone either. Our characters are from a large republic. Men and women are generally equal and cans rise within the ranks. There are dark forces at work behind the scenes of the republic that my character suspects but yours knows nothing about at first. I\u2019m going to set up a \u201caesthetic board\u201d for you to get a taste for the \u201clook\u201d of the world. In a sentence it\u2019s something between Asgard in the MCU, the Fire Emblem video games and THE WHEEL OF TIME. \n\nI write 3rd person limited (think A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE) and would like to do pretty large chunks of text. I\u2019m not talking walls and walls, but I think 2-3 paragraphs isn\u2019t such a wild request. I won\u2019t \u201cdirect\u201d too much, but I\u2019ll sort of guide the plot and we\u2019ll see where we go. \n\nFor now I want to keep this on Reddit, but that may change depending how far we get into things. I\u2019m still a little unsure about Discord, but I\u2019ve heard good things, so we may move over to that. This is definitely for folks 18 and over. While I want loads of story, I\u2019m looking for something that\u2019s kind of smutty too. It\u2019s a very hard R rating, if not NC-17/XXX. \n\nIf this sounds like your brand of vodka, drop me a little orange envelope telling me about your proposed captain. Reference pictures are always welcome. I\u2019m not afraid of having more than one person RPing this with me because I\u2019d like some different views of things. Hopefully I didn\u2019t ramble on too long and lost anyone. Drop me a line and let\u2019s see what we can do!",

            "selftext": "Hello, Reddit! \u2661\n\nIt's been a while since the last time I posted a request here, however, I've got a mighty need for a very particular craving as you may have guessed from the title.\n\nSo, just a few days ago I watched the pilot episode for this new cartoon called **Hazbin Hotel**, and although I didn't initially intend to get too into it - well, let's say I ended up falling for it so hard I ended up planting my face onto the floor.\n\nThat was a bit of a silly metaphor, but you get what I mean. Point is, I'm feeling self-indulgent AF, and I'm craving for some good old Canon x OC. That being said, I made up an OC concept I'd love to play with, and I'd absolutely LOVE to ship her with Alastor (The Radio Demon)! This request is open to anyone that wishes to indulge me on this idea I have, so if you're interested, please feel free to read the rest of the post!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR:**\n\n\\-People who would be comfortable roleplaying Canons against OC's. The option of doubling is always open! So if you want me to roleplay as a Canon for any of your OC's, please tell me because I'd love to do so! \u2661  It doesn't necessarily have to be Hazbin Hotel, can be any fandom that I have knowledge of, really. I just wanna make myself sure I can return the favor, because it's the least I can do, really.\n\n\\-**18+ roleplayers only** \\- as I intend to take things in a NSFW direction, as well as people that are open for that possibility. Pertaining to Alastor's Canon sexuality, I have no qualms with roleplaying against an asexual/ace-spectrum Alastor and compromise this aspect, but if you're uncomfortable with the idea of writing smut with him, I'd probably suggest you to *not* contact me. I won't push you to do anything you don't want to do, but as I've mentioned, I'm looking for a partner that's open to that possibility.\n\n\\-Multi-para, 3+ paragraphs, preferably. Third-person. I mainly look to do this roleplay in **Discord,** but other options are available.\n\n\\-Commitment - I'm very ditch-friendly, but I would absolutely love to make this a long-term thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn case we've never met, nice to meet you! I'm Xii, a 22 year-old roleplayer from South America! I've got 9+ years of experience, and I verse myself mainly in fandoms!  My roleplaying rules, much more detailed, as well as some info about me, are in the Google Docs below. I apologize in advance I didn't put them in here, but there are a handful, and I wanted to save you all the time.\n\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j28RYCAUDhXXK4S9FnYtASA85rJmxRSTqRpm65rKRLE/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j28RYCAUDhXXK4S9FnYtASA85rJmxRSTqRpm65rKRLE/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease feel free to DM me if you're interested in writing with me, and we shall discuss other details! You don't know how badly I'm craving to roleplay this, so whoever decides to indulge me will get my eternal love, admiration and affection.\n\nAs per usual, thanks for reading, I really appreciate it! \u2661\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Xii",

            "selftext": "I\u2019m a 29 year old with almost two decades of writing/roleplaying experience under my belt. Most of what I write is third person slice of life. I love creating universes, especially modern cities, in my head and filling them with my own original characters. I generally play female roles, but am perfectly capable of taking on a male role if I have to.  \n\nNow that that\u2019s done!! First and foremost, I will not play with anyone under 21. I\u2019m a huge lover of NSFW moments, and I don\u2019t even have words to describe the creep factor of doing those with minors- or anyone not in my age range. That being said, any smut needs to be part of the story. I need a partner who is into playing multiple characters, plots, and whatever else it takes to keep things exciting. As for roles, I must admit that I have a weakness for \u2018forbidden\u2019 relationships.  Give me plots that involve sneaking around, being secretive in public, and telling too many lies to keep up with.  Please be open-minded. Some taboo topics make for excellent plot bunnies. Proper grammar is a must, or at least as close to proper grammar as  possible for character purposes. Quality &gt; quantity!!! I\u2019m not looking to write an essay, so I won\u2019t expect that from anyone else. I tend to reply with 1-3 paragraphs. I try to match as often as possible, but I can get carried away if the muse strikes. I understand that life happens and no one can be available all the time, but I\u2019m hoping that this will turn out to be a long-term thing. Just in case: I\u2019m a huge fan of face claims!! We don\u2019t have to use them, but I\u2019m a very visual person and graphics help with immersion. I do not use cartoons or anime as a reference.",

I'm currently enrolled full-time and am aiming for a degree in Business Administration, with hopes of working somewhere in the entertainment industry. In my free time I love to play video games, watch anime and movies, cosplay and go to cons, hang out with friends, and roleplay!\n\nI'm posting here tonite to see if I can find some peeps who would be interested in doing a LoL AU RP! The idea I have in mind is based in the real world. Its basically going to revolve around Akali (played by me\\~), a 22 year-old rapper and part-time university student. I'm going for a slice of life styled flow, where we'd basically just go through the day-by-day for some chill and not too crazy roleplaying!\n\nYou can be whoever you want! You can be one of the K/DA girls or maybe a member of True Damage, any other LoL champions, or even an OC if you'd like that. I'm hoping for something long term, with a romance developing over time as the story goes on. I write usually 1-3 paragraphs per response and I'm also perfectly fine with writing adult scenes if that's your fancy\\~!\n\nI hope this post interests some of you at the very least! If you would like to RP with me, please PM me with a bit about yourself, why you are interested in RPing with me, and your Discord info! Hope to hear from all of you soon\\~!\n\n***Love,***\n\n***Ely-chan \u2665***",

            "selftext": "The Mezzo family had always been on the upswing of most trends. Their family dates back to the time of the American Revolution. Their upswing has made them rich, maybe too rich. Reno Orlando Mezzo and his wife Moore Ottilia Mezzo have everything they could ever want or need, but it doesn't stop them from making more money, and after oil went scarce, their genius invention and ideas to make the weather the next big source of power made them even richer. Their eldest child, a daughter who they have oddly named Hackelina Alianah or Hackel for short fights with her younger brother, Greene Kevin over who will be the next heir to the family business. They each want to take the company to new heights in their own way. The twin sisters, Trinity Iana and Mallah Niphia could care less about the direction of tbe company as long as \"daddy\" buys them what they want. And recently, Reno and Moore have had an oopsie baby that they have named Jarrell or Jarry Theodore. They whole family looks to the future and to your wallets to see just how wealthy they can become. \n\nWhat I Am Wanting: Someone to create a character or band of characters to fight this family as they hold the world hostage for their prices. I like book-style responses but can adapt pretty easily to most styles. Many different scenarios will happen from dramas to romance to even some NSFW stuff. So if this plot catches your eye, message me and let's get this story going! Also extra points if you can figure out the reference and connection to the names of my family.",

            "selftext": "Hello,\n\nas the title suggests, I am looking for a long term writing partner who gets highly immersed in embarking on endless fantastical journeys!\n\nI imagine it as an explorative writing experience where we start out with a character each, throw them into a setting that fits their backstories to make them meet and go on from there to organically build their world and the characters around them. We would be planning ahead by imagining upcoming key scenes and then letting our cast find their way to them.\n\nI'm a very open minded person and always available for brainstorming about the story or chatting about life, interests and pretty much anything. We can take inspiration from our passions, experiences, real life phenomenons, tropes we know [such as tv-tropes or the mbti concept to explore character relations/interactions] and all other forms of creative content we enjoy getting lost in.\n\nThe point of the RP is to explore an ever-expanding world together, come across uncommon ideas, breathe life into our characters and obviously to have fun and learn about writing and life together.\n\nAlthough I do not rp smut, believable romance is always welcome. Should such circumstances arise building up our character's love scenes and then letting them fade out beautifully is a must :)\n\n\nA little bit about me:\n\nI'm a 22 year old female and my time zone is GMT+1.\n\nWhen RPing, I prefer a literate approach with multiple paragraphs per reply. A whole world isn't built on one-liners. Of course there will be situations when replies end up shorter depending on the dynamic of the scene... I'm sure you're catching my drift by now.\n\nI recently lost my writing partner due to her changing drastically after having found a significant other [and understandingly not having had the time to keep up writing with me since]. At our best times, we used to write daily to at least every other day. Having something as captivating and enriching as that would be a dream come true.\n\nCurrently I'm in my 3rd semester of a bachelor of arts in illustration and work as a part time illustrator and copywriter in an ad agency to make ends meet. I have about 8 years of devoted writing experience and know how concepts and stories work due to my background as a trained copywriter and storyteller.\n\nDays can get busy, but depending on how invested we both get into the story (I'm hoping a lot), I can make as much time as possible for it.\n\nMy interests include anything from science-fiction, action and fantasy video-games, movies, books and more to drawing, photography, singing and metal and rock music. I also adore traveling the world and having deep conversations about anything that fascinates you/us. \n\nFrom my experiences, Discord provides the most comfortable and reliable writing experience to set up a server with multiple channels there to keep everything organized.\n\nI'm really interested in getting to know you and creating a lasting friendship with lots of smile-worthy memories and insiders to look back at. Feel free to send me a DM so we can get to know each other and see if there is that magical spark to get the journey started!",

I've recently really gotten into '80s/'90s Star Trek. I thought it could be fun to do a roleplay in the Star Trek universe. I don't expect it to be 100% canon so we can kinda do whatever we want with this. You don't have to know anything about Star Trek as long as you're into Sci-Fi. I'd also like to explore a romance between our characters that builds throughout the story. No Smut. Message and we can into the details and such.\n\nThere are a few different stories we can discuss. I'm also interested in your ideas.\n\nThe main story I'd like to follow is a new starship is unveiled that has trans-warp capabilities, allowing to jump around the universe in mere minutes. One of use would play the captain and the other would play the first officer. The first officer would feel some resentment because they wanted the captain position. This could put some drama between our characters and possibly help them grow closer. We would then just travel and explore, getting into adventures.\n\nI play a 3rd and 1st, whatever works best for you. I'd also like at least a paragraph per response. I understand sometimes it's not really possible and that's fine. I also understand that we have prior obligations and responsibilities. I'll do my best to give you a heads up. I have a discord server set up for us. Just a heads up, I use Pinterest for reference photos.\n\nAnyway, pm me and we can get into talking.",

Anyways look forward to hearing from ya! P.S. This doesn't really take place in any of the previous movies, I just thought of making a story of my own.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"I guess ye're probably wonderin' how I got meself into this dreadful situation, ey?\" Marissa spoke, with a warm but tired smile taking a sip of rum. She had a crew of her own, she was of course second in charge, the \"First Mate\". She heard all about the captain, Jack Sparrow, and his crazy antics..even met him once a long time ago on the one and only island, Tortuga, a pirate's dream land. Some would think the captain of her own ship was crazy for allowing especially a woman to be second in charge. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe was a pirate herself, her crew wouldn't dare mess with her as she would snap at them. It started with her crew and ship was ambushed by a group of sailors and fighting them off, in the end they didn't win as there was too many and it was an unequal fight.. soon their ship was bombed and everyone managed to escape the ship, Marissa wasn't able to make it into a rowboat like the rest of her mates and ended up staying afloat on a barrel, the water were cold enough to get hypothermia. Marissa was stranded after a while.... slowly letting sleep take over her thinkin' this was it....or was it? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n((continued in PMs, then I'll give you my Discord username there! Looking forward to starting this adventure with ya!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'll become more detailed once we start this off, I'm just warming up with the starter.))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[ OC Bio \\] \n\nFull name: Marissa Martinez\n\nAppearance: Although she stands at the height of five foot two (5'2''), being short comes with a feisty attitude. She has a curvy, but toned body. Strawberry blonde medium-length, messy but wavy hair. Bright emerald green eyes, and freckles speckled across her light-tanned skin (cheeks, nose, shoulders and arms, as well the rest of her torso). She had wore a cream-colored puffy shirt that was well-formed fitted with her figure, black trousers and boots.",

            "selftext": "**Hi there!**\n\nIf you're looking for a fellow writer interested in stories, character development, plotlines and details, then let me just say hello! \n\nI'm looking to start up some new and fun rps! I can write F or M characters, original or fandom (however my fandom knowledge can be a bit limited). If you've got an idea already, some characters, a setting, or both, send it over! Did an old RP you have die and you miss it with all your heart and soul? Friendo, I'm interested in revivials. Thinking about starting something up, but not sure what? Then let's work together to make up a big ol' world with characters and stories and whatnot. I love all that. \n\nI've currently got OC characters and stories in the following genres, so if any of these are up your alley, let's chat!  \n\\-Post-Apocalyptic  \n\\-Steampunk/Wild West  \n\\-Mafia/Roaring 20s  \n\\-Fantasy/DnD  \n\\-Supernatural\n\n***Please Note:***  \n\\-20+ required. I'm in my twenties, so I would just feel more comfortable with a partner closer to my age.   \n\\-I enjoy writing out detailed responses and building up characters and worlds! I never expect my partner to be able to match my length, but I would prefer more than just a few word responses.    \n\\-I can rp via email or discord, but I generally prefer discord. Not a requirement, just a preference.  \n\\-I do my best to respond at least once a day, sometimes more or less depending on the day, but I'll never badger you for responses.\n\nThanks so much for reading! PM me if you're interested, and I'm looking forward to meeting ya!",
