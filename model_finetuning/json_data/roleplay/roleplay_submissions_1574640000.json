I'm interested in anything ranging from near-future dystopias to space operas. Which includes most of what could possibly cross your mind when thinking of sci-fi, including cyberpunk, advanced technology, post-apocalyptic futures and giant robots kicking eachother. I'm especially fond of that last one, but it's really up to you!\n\nWhat I'm looking for in a partner:\n\n- Literate. Everyone makes mistakes, of course! I just ask you to be a bit careful when typing out your sentences, just take your time and it'll be fine obviously.\n\n- Creative! I love worldbuilding! It'd be really nice if we had an equal part to play in creating our world.\n\nAnd that's pretty much it! If you're interested, go ahead and send me a little PM with your Discord tag to make communication easier in the future!",

            "selftext": "I've been re-watching a bit of Merlin (the BBC show), and I kinda wanna play with some old mythology. I'd like to keep the middle ages setting where all magic is punishable by law. The role I intend to write will be of a young, powerful witch who is reincarnated about every thousand years, so I'm also pretty open to urban/modern fantasy settings as well.\n\nThe basics of the character so far are that she is either in her late teens or early 20 and very irresponsible/immature. Her destiny is to protect the weak, but she will try to fight against this due to the pressure of it all. She often uses her powers frivolously for her own personal gain but needs a lot of training to hone them completely.\n\nI'm looking for someone to play a mentoring role, someone who could also have magic and/or has been training in the craft longer. I don't know how they'd meet yet, but we can go *in medias res* and start while they've already known each other for whatever amount of time we choose. Romance is not required, but if we're considering it, I would prefer someone a smidge older with maybe a boyish demeanor or a perfectionist that's a little uptight. Could take on a vaguely brotherly position at first.\n\nI have no issue with NSFW scenes *with prior development and/or chemistry.* I cannot stress this enough. I do not want this to be the sole focus of the characters, especially from the very beginning. Once we lay down the groundwork of their dynamic, then I'll be open to discussing and writing it more often.",

I have some ideas when it comes to mecha type stuff that I'd love to roleplay.\n\nI was inspired by reading about [ALICE](https://gundam.fandom.com/wiki/ALICE) on the Gundam wiki, and I'd love to roleplay something with a similar premise; **a pilot has an on-board AI of their giant mech who gains sentience through the help of their human pilot**. I don't mind playing either role! I think this could be done within the Gundam timeline, a pick-and-choose format for the mechs found within the series, or original robots all together.\n\n**That said, I'm just craving a lot of mecha stuff in general**. So if Gundam, Macross, or Eva is your thing, just hit me up and see what we can figure out.\n\n\\- **I use third person, past tense, paragraph style when I roleplay**.\n\n\\- **I prefer to plan and talk OOC on instant messenger** \\- I have discord. **E-mail is fine too!** Roleplaying can be done on e-mail or IM. I don't do Google Docs or kik. I'd love to work out story details with you OOC.\n\n**-I don't have any preferences for gender** but tend to bring **dudes** to the table, but I'm not looking for something entirely romantic or fluffy. I'm not searching for something all doom and gloom either, though.\n\n\\- I'm on PST and often can reply at the very least a handful of times a day, but I try to reply as much as I humanly can around my job.\n\nI think that's everything! If you read all of this, when you PM me, let me know what your favorite giant robot is, and have an awesome day.",

            "selftext": " Why, hello there, \n\nWith the latest trailers and info about, *Persona 5: Scramble,* and *Persona 5 Royal* being out in Japan, the love for that world/game has resurfaced within me. It was never gone, but after completing the base game a few times, I had let my love for the Thieves fall into the background. Now, its back, and I wish to write something within the world/or characters.\n\nAs for plot/story ideas, I don\u2019t have anything super concrete just yet, more basic thoughts and ideas to be tossed about and work-shopped. I\u2019ll list them, now!\n\n*Quick side note*: When speaking about the Protagonist, I will call him Joker. I love Ren, and Don\u2019t mind Akira. Sometimes I even call him Akiren, but Joker is the name everyone loves, so Joker it is.\n\n* *Time-Loop AU:* Given the emphasis on time, and all of that, we could take a Groundhog\u2019s day approach, and Have Joker Stuck in some loop. (Could be within the main story, but with something new we create causing the loop).\n* *Different Transfer Student AU*: Saw a post of this on Twitter, it was just a picture but proposed the idea, if another of the Thieves was the Transfer student, rather than Joker. The post I saw, suggested if Makoto said transfer, which could always be a way to take things!\n* Crossover with Other Franchises!: I\u2019ve always fancied the idea of A Kingdom Hearts and P5 crossover, given both games deal with Hearts. Plus, Donald working with the Thieves is a lovely thought. Could also have the Thieves be Pokemon trainers, cause Sword and Shield came out, and I\u2019ve been playing a lot of that. Maybe adapting them into Stand Users.\n* Akechi\u2019 Redemption. :Something with Pancake Boi, and perhaps turning a new lead, at some point in the game. I Suppose this could be considered an AU.\n* Gender flip AU: Again, saw the concept online, and thought it was a fun concept! Could always be used.\n* Not much of a fun concept, but I\u2019d love to include the Dancing in Star Light costumes, in any idea, somehow. I *adore* those costumes on the characters.\n* Basing things like the Mementos Mission Manga: Side-stories, and new events. Could even add new palaces and such!\n* Ships! Of course, they can be added into any idea we end up doing, but I felt the need to note I am open to including some romance. Feel free to mention any of your favorite ships, if you end up messaging me.\n* Any thoughts or idea, you may have is always free to be tossed onto the table!\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nSo yeah! So Phantom Thief stuff would be lovely! Those aren\u2019t all bits of thoughts I have, but enough for now. Of course, if you want to suggest something not there, feel free. (No promises if I will like the suggestion, but I am always open to hear different ideas.)\n\nAs far as writing, and partner stuff goes, do know:I ask that my partner and I write in third person, as the point of view. Can write a paragraph or few, rather than a sentence or two. IRL gender doesn\u2019t matter to me. Everyone is welcome.I personally like to double, and write multiple characters, and enjoy partners who also. Though, I won\u2019t turn anyone away if they don\u2019t.\n\nI am over 18 years old, if any one was curious. Open to write in different mediums. Anything else? Ask away in a Private message. (Not reddit chat.)\n\nThanks for reading!",

            "selftext": "Greetings and thank you for reading this. I\u2019ll start with a little about myself. I am a literate and experienced, mature-age roleplayer who has played across multiple platforms including chat, emails and even MMOs. My interests lie in both the small-scale character building and the large-scale worldbuilding that accompanies it.\n\nWhat I am looking for in a partner is somebody similar who has a similar approach to mine. I believe that two way communication is key to success in a RP relationship and that the players should not only engage with each other, but also feel free discuss and suggest plot, story and worldbuilding ideas.\n\nI am looking for something specific with regards to my character; I will be playing a MtF Trans character. What stage of their transition they are at is open to negotiation, but regardless they identify and present as female.\n\nI am interested in original worlds and settings based around Cyberpunk, Sci-Fi, Post-Apocalyptic and Low Fantasy genres. I have a few basic ideas I can work from for each of these, but I am also very much open to ideas and collaboratively building a world. I am only looking for one-to-one RP, not group games. I am not averse to including NSFW elements, but only as a part of the story, rather than for the simple sake of it.\n\nI prefer to play via email or Discord. If you are interested, please **PM** me. I will **not** reply to posts on this thread or chat requests.",

If you don't know what to write we can talk about it, communication is key.\n\u2022 I am Open for NSFW but let's talk about it first and I really don't want it to be the only thing the characters are doing.\n\u2022 As mentioned above please be around my age don't write if you're below 18.\n\u2022 Please don't need a month to reply if you know you can't reply within a week don't message me cause if I notice you can't provide I will just delete the Roleplay.\nUnless you have a reason I know everyone has a life and needs to work but waiting so long sucks for both of us.\n\u2022 Don't message me if you use real people as face claim it makes me uncomfortable please use drawings.\n\nOkay now about me:\n\u2022 Fandoms I am in: Marvel ; DC ; Steven Universe ; Adventure Time ; Bloodborn ; Skyrim ; Fallout 4 ; Persona 5 ; Sailor Moon ; Pokemon ; Houseki no Kuni ; Kimetsu no yaiba \n\n\u2022 Generally things I Like: Fantasy ; Horror ; Slice of Life ; Highschool / College ; Supernatural ; Love (open for mxf and fxf)\n\n\u2022 For the Females out here I don't mind playing males but if I would like to double so I at least can play one female character.\n\n\u2022 I got some stories if you don't have any Yourself:\n\n1. The two characters are going to college and people around your city are going missing.\nAs you start becoming friends one of your characters goes missing at a college party and after some hours the whole building crashes down you are the only survivor or so you thought... (It's supernatural with slice of life and romance)\n\n2. One of our characters hates life it doesn't seem like it's worth living while trying to game end themselves they suddenly see a ghost (which will be the other person)  but they loose their consciousness shortly after. When they wake up they notice that they are in a hospital. They survived and they are glad about it because they can't stop thinking if what they saw was real or fake. But soon enough they notice that they are able to see ghosts. With their new power they want to confront the ghost they saw in their apartment which will turn around their whole life.\n\n\n3. Werewolves, Vampires, Dragons, Unicorns and all those monsters used to be things that did not excist until now.\nSociety is thriving after monsters showed themselves.\nThey were real all along but trying to live with humans is not so easy. People don't accept them try to push them out of their cities. It's a huge problem in society even so much that some monsters try to hide themselves again while others proudly show who they really are. Some even kill humans to show that monsters will conquer the world soon enough.\nYou on the other hand don't really mind them and after your old roommate left you for their partner you are trying to find a new one you get lots of requests but you soon found someone that seemed perfect.\nBut you feel like they are hiding something from you...could it be they are a monster? \n(Romance would be here the main focus)\n\nGenerally I love roleplay and I love to get my to partner aswell share our Fandoms and memes I adore talking outside of the rp as much as inside.\nSince I do art i definitely will draw our characters lmao.\nSo if you are the same hit me up but please add \"Monster\" in your text message so I know you read everything.",

Thanks!)\n\n**About Me**\n\nAnyway! Hi, I'm Aterose and currently looking for a long term roleplay partner, though that much is obvious. I\u2019m a nineteen-year-old (twenty in a few months if that counts for anything) female living in the EST timezone. I have about 8-9 years of writing experience and consider myself pretty literate.\n\n**What I\u2019m Searching For**\n\n* Literacy. I prefer to roleplay with someone who can write at least two to three paragraphs minimum. The two of us should be going well over Discord's 2000 character limit.\n* Willing to chat OOC. I find it important to have a friendship with my partners as well as discussing future plots for our roleplay.\n* Must play both male and female characters.\n* Third-person only \n* Romance. Our roleplay won't revolve around romance but more so our plot. If our characters are hitting it off though I'm all for it.\n* Patience. I work 4-5 days a week so don\u2019t ask me when I\u2019m going to reply next, I can\u2019t stress this enough. \n* Finally I require you to not reply every day. An odd request but if I have a partner replying hours after my own reply I feel obligated to respond. As stated before I have a busy life. Please wait at least 24 hours before responding.\n\n**What I Will Not Do** \n\n* Smut (I prefer to fade to black)\n* Modern\n* Historic\n* Canon characters (From you or me) \n* Fandoms. Unless I have seen/read/played the fandom and the plot is good enough. This is a big maybe though. Roleplays inspired by fandoms is fine. \n\n**What I\u2019m Interested In**\n\n* Sandbox! I\u2019m all for sandbox. It leaves a ton of room to do whatever we want. I almost always do dystopian future settings and possibly some fantasy thrown in there.\n* One idea I have is not very detailed but we can figure it out along the way. The government has fallen due to a force we can discuss. There was chaos, death, and destruction. A large town/small city decided to come together and form their own government, only they couldn't come to an agreement as well so they split the city in half. Our characters are on opposite sides. We can decide what their goal is, whether that be putting an end to the dispute or something else. \n* Other than that I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m interested in right now, I\u2019ve been branching out due to partners having some pretty amazing ideas so I guess I\u2019ll just continue with that. Just throw whatever ideas you got at me and we can figure something out! Please suggest at least one idea when messaging me. \n\nIf you're interested or just have questions shoot me a message with your ideas and a little bit of information about yourself. I will not respond to chat requests or \"Still looking?\". Please DM only. Also, if you've read everything add your favorite color to your message. Hope to hear from you soon!",

            "selftext": "To make it quite plain; I\u2019m a sucker for romance. Even moreso when the characters start off in positions and situations where they dislike each other for whatever reason, and then grow together over the course of the story. I like slow burn romances \u2013 from the early blushes, to the eventual much more intimate parts. \n\nSome people like prompts, others don\u2019t. In this case, I\u2019ve only written some in case a prompt is what you\u2019re after, and it will (I hope) help to give you an idea of the kind of story I\u2019m looking for too. **This is by no means the extent of what I\u2019m willing to rp \u2013 if you have an idea and you think it fits the theme, just PM me!** The *italicised* character is the one I\u2019d want to play myself. They\u2019re in no particular order, and I\u2019m certain some of these could easily be combined as well, if you wanted. \n\n* Arranged Marriage \u2013 a match neither of us really want, but are being forced into. Or perhaps your character does desire it, and it\u2019s a matter of demonstrating why mine should too. \n* *Prisoner of War* \u2013 defeated, used as leverage, maybe just good old kidnapped; however I got there, whoever you are (soldier, General, maybe even royalty), we\u2019ll have to learn to get along.\n* Assassin x *Mark* \u2013 there are so many different reasons an assassin might hesitate, or be forced to delay. Maybe they want to get closer before going in for the kill, or maybe they realise their preferred method isn\u2019t working, and have to take the time to develop a Plan B.\n* Villain x *Hero* \u2013 a typical superhero and villain scenario; enemies that eventually find common ground and interest in one another. \n* Traditional Rivals \u2013 perhaps more appropriate to a fantasy setting, but think things like vampires x werewolves, demons x angels etc.\n* Rival Houses \u2013 generations of families that hate each other, and maybe we do too, but there\u2019s an edge to that dislike that\u2019s too hard to ignore. Or perhaps now something\u2019s come up and we are forced to tackle the problem together. \n\n**Setting**\n\nI\u2019m fairly flexible in terms of the setting of the game. I enjoy fantasy, sci fi or historical settings the most, but if you want modern, modern fantasy or even SOL I\u2019m happy to do that. \n\n**About Me**\n\nI\u2019m over 25, female, and very literate. I don\u2019t expect you to match me. I enjoy writing, and sometimes if I\u2019m really into a story I can get carried away and write a lot. Some people seem to get put off by this. I hate ghosting, so I will always do my best not to do that to you. I\u2019d appreciate if you weren\u2019t interested in the rp anymore that you just tell me so instead of disappearing*. I always play females*; I can play males if they\u2019re side characters, but not my main PC. I don\u2019t mind if you play a M or F character. I prefer to write in 3rd person past tense. Sometimes I get busy, and can only reply once a day or every two days. I\u2019ll let you know if I\u2019m going to be away longer. I don't mind writing NSFW content but prefer if it's not the entire focus of the rp. I play over Discord or email. \n\n**About You** \n\nBe over 18. Write more than 1 line. Write dialogue, contribute to the plot, write feelings, express emotions. Be willing to commit to something long term. If you\u2019ve read this far and you\u2019re still interested, include in your message to me how long the longest RP you ever wrote in was. I don\u2019t mind if you like to chat OOC or not. Be patient. Tell me if you need to go away for a few days or can\u2019t reply for awhile for whatever reason. It\u2019s fine. Life comes first. Don\u2019t be a ghost though, because they suck. \n\n**So\u2026**\n\nIf you\u2019re still interested after reading all of that, send me a DM! Let me know what interests you, and what your initial ideas for a plot might be. **If this post is still up, I\u2019m still looking for partners.** \n\nThanks! X",

I've had couple of roleplays in this setting that turned out really well, and I've had the incredible urge to try and replicate that success. So, simply put, I just need **18+ people**, male or female, who would be potentially interested in building up this world with me!\n\nHere are some of my caveats:  \n\\-**18+** Like I stated above. This is mainly story based, but yes, occasional adult themes can pop up, so better to be safe than sorry  \n\\-**Third-person only.** I don't hate first person, but this simply makes things smoother. This is usually not a big deal, but I know some people only like to write in first.  \n**-Competent writing.** This is probably the biggest point on here. Everyone has different levels of roleplaying, and I'm searching for the more nuanced way. At the same time, I'm flexible. As long as you can put together a coherent response, I'm most likely game.\n\nIf you want to try it or simply find out some more information, PM me, and I can give you my Discord ID. Cheers!\n\n**I\u2019m still looking!**",

            "selftext": "Hey there! I had an idea of an rp to do but I keep getting ghosted or sidetracked so I was hoping to find a male 21+ to write with me on this new idea. Bear with me it\u2019s a bit of a confusing idea. I\u2019d like us both to write multiple characters and in Literate 3rd on Discord also.\nSo my idea revolves around this in timeline order, (but not necessarily written in that order just perhaps explained or later revealed) You are either A. The younger rightful heir to the throne or B. The bastard son of the late king or C. A better idea than I had.\nYour other older brother was killed, and presumably it\u2019s Prince A\u2019s fault. A coverup of the brothers death sends Prince A to another kingdom to stay. The Queen has a hatred for Prince B and in the past has repeatedly tried to be rid of him. Prince A meets whomever I write (a commoner or non-royalty is ideal) and she ends up coming back with him to his home kingdom after the news of the eldest brother\u2019s death settles. Prince A is going to be crowned king and already has a betrothed princess from far away. \nNow this is where it could be complicated.\nI thought maybe my character could fall in love with whatever character you choose or come up with. Either prince A whom she\u2019s already met, or Prince B, the bastard and you could write either however and add whatever neat flair you\u2019d like.\nI was thinking maybe they learn that the murder was actually set up by the queen, and it was actually Prince B who she meant to kill and not her favorite eldest son. \nThe queen hates my character who Prince A has admittedly kind of fallen for. But since he has to marry another woman, prince B courts my character instead. Perhaps she could have feelings for both and have to choose, or maybe there could be a scandal where my character falls with child and has to marry whichever prince so it\u2019s not a disgrace and a bastard (because the queen already hates that.) \nThen they could later uncover the truth about the queen, perhaps go to war, or whatever we choose. This could be medieval or modern. Whichever. There\u2019s so much potential and different ways to go. If it\u2019s Prince A You choose that could mean my character becomes possibly queen or if it\u2019s Prince B it could mean trouble or quarreling or even more death and mystery. I\u2019m down for anything. \nI hope this is interesting to you! Message me with any ideas you have or thoughts and we can see if this is a good match. I don\u2019t mind \u201cmature\u201d themes but I do love good story driven romance and character development. Hope to hear from you soon!",

Your powers could be used to control the world outside you with your mind, moving objects with your pure will.\n\nYour kingdom and dynasty have only ever won, until now.

I've recently been watching the Vabylinia anime for the Fate series and I've been reminded just how much I love this universe.\n\nWhat I'm looking for is quite simple. I either want to play a Master to someone's Servant or the Servant to someone's Master. We can either follow one of the Grail Wars that exist currently or we can start our own Grail War.\n\nI'm sort of looking for OC x Canon, but I'm absolutely not against us playing Canon characters. I'm more than willing to discuss the finer details as well, so if you have your own ideas, by all means, bring them to the table!\n\nAs far as requirements, please be over 18 and preferably at least 20, as I want to play with someone a bit closer to my age. Please also be grammatically correct, though I can absolutely excuse the few odd typos. I'm not too stingy on post length, just give me something to work with, at least a paragraph. And I understand that life happens, just please communicate with me if you need some time, don't leave me guessing.\n\nHopefully this has garnered some attention, and if it has, feel free to PM me! Hope to hear from you all soon!",

I don\u2019t care what the pairing is (MxM or FxM), but I will only roleplay male characters. \nI got plenty of plot ideas and am open to hearing yours as well!\n\nI\u2019m very easygoing and laidback when it comes to roleplaying and I\u2019m looking forward to hearing from some of you! My Discord is alpha#4639. \n\nThanks!",

It has been distributed into several factions such as the World Government and Revolutionary Army as to keep their silence. Blackbeard has defeated the crew of Monkey D Luffy and horded their devil fruits. Taking control of the four emperors of the sea, Blackbeard continued to spread his influence over the calming sea, fighting and taking the fruits of all those he found; amassing them to the point where he controlled 98% of all fruits. \n\nIn an attempt to free the world from the reigns of Blackbeard, the Revolutionary army, lead by Monkey D. Dragon, made an attempt to reclaim some of the fruits and strengthen their own forces. Unbeknownst to them however, the World Government and sent a powerful fleet consisting elite units to combat this assault. The Battle was bloody and vicious, many lives where lost and sent into the fray; fruits being destroyed and regrowing elsewhere in the world. The battle ended with a face off between Monkey D Dragon and Blackbeard, and in a last ditch attempt, thousands of tonnes of explosives where detonated and cleared the building and everybody inside.\n\nThe location of Blackbeard and Dragon are unknown, however, what is known is that the fruits where destroyed, spread amongst the world as both the Revolutionary Army and The World Government limped away to lick their wounds.\n\nThe world moved on as the fruits regrew, the world government seizing a stronger hold on the sea as the Revolutionary army sought to gather more members. Whilst fledgling pirates began to see the opportunity, whoever controlled the fruits had the most power, and the age of devil fruits was reborn.\n\n- THE NEW AGE OF PIRATES HAD ARRIVED -\n\nMan there are plenty of One piece servers out there but what makes this one different. I'll tell you!\n\nBalanced character leveling- As much as we love luffy and his main character skill leveling we would like to make this fun for everyone!\n\nNew canon- we here in the Golden journey server are starting from a brand spanking new plot line meaning no pesky canon to work your self into \n\nFun and open staff- No only are our staff fun and open but most of us will elect probably not to bite you. \n\nAnd MUCH MORE!\n\nif you wanna join us you just gotta come on down and stick around!\n\nhttps://discord.gg/qdR5rkm",

I prefer they are canon, but honestly, anything is alright. \n\nLadies I love yall but I only do best friend rps with my fellow waman, I'm sorry please don't hate me. \n\nFellas, I don't mind the rp turning romantic should the plot lead it that way, but I want to make sure there is chemistry. We can talk more details if we decide to RP. \n\nI have a silly lil' request. I really want to rp with my favorite Marvel lady with a Winter Soldier. I just love the angst and so many different angles that can happen. I have just so many ideas. Please, someone, do this with me. I also super love Xmen role play, Avengers Rp, Justice League and Bat-Family rp. \n\nBonus points, if you want to rp as an obscure character that I don't know.......then you get the choice of one amazing high five or an epic fist bump. One per customer, please. \n\nI am a bit of a Super Hero fan, mainly Marvel but I do love DC. I know more about Superheroes and random facts about them then I know my own family.   \n\n\nDisclaimer.

Have done Dom/Sub , Fantasy , Medieval , Post-Apocalyptic  , A song of Ice and Fire , TV shows like GoT , TWD and Films such as Marvel and DC . Not asking for  longterm or anything just want to find detailed roleplayers up for some  fun but if we work well together then we can stay in touch and try  different scenes , don't always set up a complicated story with twists.  Prefer simple roles to be honest but always up to try new things . I can play as M  , F or Futa and you can play any gender you wish as well .

You ran drugs for a mob you\u2019ve been a member of since you were a teenager, you had plans to slowly climb the ladder and get the highest rank possible, and was succeeding until you made one decision to stop and help a middle aged woman who was seemingly being robbed, police showed up they recognized your vehicle as it had been reported many times, he decides to search your vehicle and you\u2019re immediately placed in handcuffs and taken to prison. Unfortunately the mob is no help to you, if they help you it would only blow their whole operation so they leave you in jail to take your case to trial. \n\nOutside of prison I\u2019m a full time arts teacher at Pinewood Academy, however on the evenings and some weekends I volunteer my time at the prison, also instruction art seminars, they\u2019re much more than just drawings, we draw, read poetry, paint, listen to music/discuss music, and even talk about the history of art. \n\nYou always seem to find yourself in hot water inside the prison and you\u2019re encouraged by your councillor to take one of the programs offered in the prison to keep yourself out of trouble. You take my class passing it off as the easiest one where you\u2019d have to put the minimal effort in. Turns out you\u2019re a natural when it comes to drawing and painting, a talent you didn\u2019t even know you had. \n\nFalling in love with an inmate is the last thing I expected to do. My family was very strict and always enticed me to be a proper lady, go to school, have a career, get married and start my own family. They would never want me with someone like you. \n\nA bachelor life filled with one might stands and no real attachment made you believe you would never settle down, if there were anyone who could do so it would be me. \n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nPlease be detail and descriptive\nGive legible responses \nLooking for MALES only.",

I am 22 years old, I  live in Europe, GMT +3 timezone and English is not my first language, so  felt like giving you a heads up. I have not roleplayed in quite a few  months and I found myself missing it a lot. I have an OC witch female I  have wanted to play for a while and I am willing to share more details  with you about her if you decide to PM or contact me!\n\nI  have been roleplaying for over a decade now and I\u2019ve been in love  writing as long as I remember. My main fandom is Marvel, but I\u2019m also  very open to DC and Miraculous Ladybug ones. If we both find ourselves  hitting it off and having fun writing together \u2013 I\u2019d be open to have  more than one ship with you and we can build the entire world around it!  I just would love to find a good friend in roleplaying partner with  whom we both can always brainstorm ideas together about our characters.\n\nMy  preferred length for replies is from 2 to 3 paragraphs, sometimes even  more. I do love to get detailed and inside of my character\u2019s head quite a  lot. I try to reply every single day and as often as I can although  sometimes work or other things may get in my way.\n\nIf you\u2019ve got any questions, feel free to message me and let\u2019s discuss things together\\~",

Cramped apartments filled with testosterone reeking military men in civilian clothes. Undercover CIA agents balancing on the thin line between right and wrong. Border patrols with drones and service dogs. Joined operations. Black ops.\n\n*Bad guys doing good things and good guys doing bad. Which side are we on? There's no black and white in this world. Just the shades of grey soaked in blood...*\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**RP SPECS**\n\nThis will be a multi-paragraph collaborative storytelling between experienced writers. Rich in various types of characters and personalities (both on the cartel and military side). With main focus on masculine, adult men and their platonic and romantic relationships.\n\nEqually plot and character development driven. Timeskips, mild god-modding, controlling each other's NPCs as well as pre-establishing some aspects of the scene is encouraged whenever it makes sense and helps to move the story forward. I hope we're both ready for some research if needed!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf all of this sounds like it's up your alley?

            "selftext": "~Welcome To The Saga Of Nobuhana~\n\nLong divided, must unite. Long united, must divide...hence the saying goes...\n\nThe regime of The Great Giri Empire over Nobuhana had lasted nearly 4 centuries. Originally bringing peace to the land to supplant the wicked and corrupt government of old. However after such a long time, the cycle repeats once more and the empire only decays more and more everyday. Corruption is the norm as taxes on the peasantry only go higher, natural disasters have repeatedly hit the nation, and a worthless emperor presided on the throne. Discontent was at all time high and it was only a matter of time before chaos would erupt across the land. However in these trying times it is up to men and women of talent to take up the task and change the country in their own image!\n\n~At The Saga Of Nobuhana We Offer~\n\n\n&gt;We offer semi literate RP,\n\n\n\n&gt;A close knit community!\n\n\n\n&gt;A variety of roleplay options, there is something for everyone!\n\n\n\n&gt;A player dependent combat system!\n\n\n\n&gt;And we are active daily!\n\n\nAnd Much More!\n\nWe are new, but we hope you enjoy your time on the server! \n\nhttps://discord.gg/vQTWAVV",

            "selftext": "After seeing Joker, I have been super intrigued by the development/backstory of the Joker. I know DC fans either loved or hated the film. I personally had no idea of what to expect and, in the end, thought it was very well done. I found the film very unsettling, but realistic as to how mental health can unfortunately be perceived by others. For my roleplay idea, I would personally love to introduce Arthur Fleck to Dr. Harleen Quinzel. Canon faceclaims and comics aside (Although, I have read my fair share of Harley Quinn comics), I really just want to embody the tone of the movie in the RP, as well as who he was and how their infatuation might have started in Arkham State Hospital. Please PM me if interested (21+, novella-style writers)!\n\nPS: I am EST. I use Discord, and I can promise 2-3 replies a week, typically more. Please keep in mind that I do go to graduate school and have a part-time job on top of a social life, so I cannot be around 24/7. However, I will keep you updated on my availability.",

I prefer a forum like Jcink   but I\u2019d be open to trying a discord server whether it be a group thing   or one on one. I just saw Midway and that has been a big inspiration  for  me but I also liked the Ben Affleck Pearl Harbor.\n\nI   had a character concept of a guy in his 20\u2019s- 30\u2019s from Boston who   doesn\u2019t take kindly to bullies. The original plan was to have him desert   the US to join a Canadian air group and join the War in early 1940.\n\nI\u2019m not a historian but I like the period.\n\nI   found one Jcink board but it wasn\u2019t a great fit. They were really   technical when it came to knowledge of History and while I get that you   need to have the basics I don\u2019t think I need to memorize units and all   of that.\n\nAs far as ideas go if it was going to be a one on one kinda thing. I guess I have a few writing prompts.\n\n\\-I   met you back home in Boston. We\u2019ve been away for a while. (We could   correspond during the war until I get back and then we could deal with   the return)\n\n\\-You\u2019re in London and I met you between missions. We get to know each other.\n\n\\-I get shot down over France and you nurse me back to health or maybe you help me hide from the Germans.\n\n\\-I   get shot down over Germany and you\u2019re a German girl. Maybe we don\u2019t  get  along at first. Either i\u2019m in a hospital or hiding out.\n\nI\u2019m   open to other ideas too. I have discord. Message me and we can chat   about things.

            "selftext": " \n\nHello all - apologies for this wall of text, but I have a couple of fandoms I'm interested in and then a very specific Marvel idea I'd also be interested in! I'm looking for a M character to my F character, but I don't care about your real gender! I also prefer a dash of romance in my rps but I don't like to rush into them. Smut is a side dish, not a main course for me! Also, up front - I don't double (beyond playing side characters as needed)! Sorry, it's just not my thing!\n\n**Cyberpunk Genre**\\* (I have a very vague idea about a tale involving corporate greed &amp; super soldiers that I would possibly bring to the table here, but I'm open to suggestions! OCs go wild here - my big exception on OCs, tbh! Not looking for any canon characters here - feel free to bring a plot for this one! I'm also up to coming up with one together!)\n\n**Sherlock**\\*\\* (Prefer to play with canon characters here, esp Sebastian Moran even though he's.. slightly not canon? I have a very well developed OC I'd like to use with this one! I have a couple different plot routes that we could go through here - the Big Choice you would make is if you want to take the \"Follow Moriarty\" or \"Destroy Moriarty\" route!)\n\n**Westworld**\\* (I'd like if it was both OCs, though still FxM, and I'd like to modify the world a little to better fit a long-term rp- I also would LOVE to make a cyberpunk WW - taking place outside of the parks in an AU where the hosts were more widespread is also totally in the cards! Lots of ways to go with this one)\n\nAnd **Marvel**\\*\\*\\*\n\nI would play Darcy Lewis (weird choice, I know, but I for some reason dig these pairings?), an OFC of mine, or possibly Peggy Carter, but I've never written her so it might take me a little bit to dial in to her frequency. I would like you to play Steve Rogers and/or Bucky Barnes (had one person suggest both and if that's your thing, sign me up). The storyline I had in mind is as follows: Darcy or Peggy or the OC, we'll call just MC (for my character) and Steve or Bucky (S/B) meet in the 1940s, right after the 107th has been rescued by Cap and the Howling Commandos unit is formed. MC is one of the nurses assigned to the unit, where she meets S/B! Cue a few sparks, a budding friendship/relationship, and hopefully a slow burn? And then, of course, a little tragedy. Bucky goes into the ice, and then it's Steve's turn, and then, finally, MC gets grabbed by Hydra and gets the Soldier treatment. (I'm flexible in what order MC goes into the ice, btw!) The time frame in which MC goes under will probably change depending on the character you would want to play. If Bucky is the character being used we can include a fun little dark interlude with them both working for Hydra, not knowing each other but there's still SOMETHING there - til eventually they are separated again. Everyone ends up in the 21st century, and I was thinking of our characters meeting perhaps a year after the events of TWS - but before CW. Honestly? Kinda throwing CW and everything after it out the window. OUR canon now. So, a year: long enough I think for Hydra programming to have been broken through enough to allow MC to recognize S/B and for Bucky to recognize MC if we're using him. And then from there we can have them take down Hydra and other baddies as we come up with them - this is just a foundation! I would prefer romance to be a decent part of the story, but not to make it all about that INSTANTLY. I think things need to build to a realistic place. From there, NSFW scenes are A-Okay for the most part, but not the core of the story, please.\n\n**About my writing:** I write in third person and past tense, and my reply length varies depending on the current story situation. There are times for long introspection or lots of details, but sometimes all you need is a couple lines of dialogue to keep the story moving. I pretty much always want to mainly play a female character and have FxM pairings, but I'll play side characters of any gender as needed throughout the story. I don't really like doubling, I find it overwhelming. I don't love pairing my characters with other OCs unless it's in certain fandoms (or out of fandoms) and the OC is like... a realistic person, you feel? I prefer to rp with people who have good spelling and a decent grasp of grammar - though playing fast and loose with the rules for the sake of style is totally understandable.\n\nI'm good with writing pretty much anything, but I prefer to rp with those that are 18+, mostly because I'm CERTAINLY not writing smut with a minor. And it's also NOT primarily about the smut. I'm not interested in fulfilling your long line of dirty nonsense that several people have brought to me that have nothing to do with the fandoms I've listed. Sick of that, lads!\n\n**About me:** I'm a 22 year old rper who has been going maybe 7 or 8 years now. I like drama and romance (and some smut) in my rps, and I think rps thrive on good arcs of conflict. Interpersonal drama, dangerous threats, and the (very) occasional dash of lighthearted fun. Again - I mainly play females - but I'll do any side characters who pop in and out.\n\n**I would like you to be:** literate! I don't need purple prose but I'd like a little detail - I like my rps to feel like a good book - it's not a race! Reply frequency does NOT matter to me - I understand that real life is inevitable!\n\nSend me a message if you're into any of these! Also - **I will provide writing samples on request!**",

I\u2019m going to play as the man that gains possession of you, who will play as a girl offered as a quest reward.\n\nMy kinks are wide ranging and my limits are potty play and gore. I\u2019ll discuss more kinks on kik.\n\nIf you\u2019re a fan of western aesthetics mixed with some magic and sci-fi, read on!\n\n\ufeffSetting\n\n\ufeffThis story will take place in the fictional solar system of Ophelion. It features far more inhabitable planets than ours and houses many different cultures as well as horrors. \n\nSaladin\n\nSaladin is a planet not unlike earth. It has varied biomes and two magnetic poles at its opposite ends. The planet\u2019s inhabitants consist of many species from  mindless beasts to conquering kingdoms of humans and other races. Though it\u2019s history is that of bloody conflict, feudal lords, technological advancement, and eventually space travel, Saladin is often regarded as the jewel of the system. It\u2019s many kingdoms are ironically named after flowers.\n\nEos\n\nEos features wide plains, tall mountains, and many rich mines. It provides the perfect environment for factories and military opportunities. It\u2019s established as a training center for the armies of many kingdoms as well as a testing ground for new weaponry.\n\n\nAzure\n\nAzure is a planet consisting mainly of great oceans and scenic islands. It was colonized by humans and it\u2019s native aquatic humanoids were driven away from their ancestral homes so that casinos and resorts could be put in place to generate revenue for the rulers on Saladin. Quarrels between the two are commonplace.\n\nNavarro\n\nNavarro is a planet outside of Saladin\u2019s control. Mostly lawless, it features many sprawling cities and gangs that go unchecked. Crime is commonplace, thus it\u2019s a popular stop for slavers, smugglers, and any other kind of outlaw.\n\nOrion\n\nOrion is the agricultural center of the system. It\u2019s environment and soil surpasses any other planet\u2019s in Ophelion; naturally, Saladin\u2019s rulers established their farms and outposts on the world, disregarding any natives. Unlike Azure, the Saladinians began interbreeding with the humanoid residents of Orion to establish their own peaceful society.\n\n\ufeffCharacters\n\n\ufeff(This bit will be left almost void of content due to the fun that comes from exploration.)\n\nQueen Emilia Thorne\nEmilia Thorne is the queen of the Kingdom of Rose, the predominant faction in the system. She and her kin are a mysterious lot despite their fame and all share similar shades of blood red hair. \n\nKing Julius IX\n\nJulius IX is king to Bleeding Heart and it\u2019s connected tribes. He is also the main enemy of the Kingdom of Rose, as he believes that they are a weak people just as his forefathers. Though past the ages of outspoken aggression, there are no doubts he condones acts of terrorism committed against the Rose.\n\nKline Ambrose\n\nKline Ambrose is the leader of The Pet Shop, a notorious gang of slavers and pirates that stretches across the system. Though his name and face are known across worlds, he hasn\u2019t been put down yet.\n\n\ufeffAdventure Awaits!",

Which usually means it\u2019s an idea that won\u2019t disappear until I play it out! Haha\n\nEssentially, I\u2019d be playing a high class escort that you\u2019ve hired (or maybe someone hired me for you?) for the entire night, a fancy pre dinner included and all! I think I like the idea of sex going to happen, but getting to know the other person before it happens. If that makes sense? But it\u2019s clear I\u2019m here to make your night better, so I can act however you want me to. I am yours for night. \n\nI\u2019m looking for someone with interesting dialogue at least, be able to hold a conversation and eventually be able to hold a detailed sex scene when the time arrives. I don\u2019t care who your character is, they can be anyone! I\u2019m just doing my job :) we can discuss pre prompt stuff before we start!\n\nSo please let me know if you like the sound of this, open with some ideas for the setup or just introduce yourself! And no this is not just a smut RP, we can\u2019t just straight to it. This isn\u2019t dirty pen pals! Eventually we will reach dirty stuff though!",

            "selftext": "{F4A} Too much down time...HELP!\n\nHi hi. I wanna make this short and sweet so no one has to spend forever trying to find a partner! I\u2019m a 22 year old female in MST (mountain standard time) that\u2019s interested in a long term roleplay. I have a few ideas up my sleeve so I\u2019m ready to discuss them as well as any ideas my partner might have! I have a lot of down time right now so please, let\u2019s write. I have 9+ years of experience but I am using my phone so bare with me. If you have messaged me in the past, please don\u2019t be afraid to do so again, I may have just not gotten to it because my inbox fills up quite quickly! I will talk about requirements and more in directs messages, but I do require my partner to be 18+ so it does not conflict with anything we may write about. Thank you for your time \u2764\ufe0f",

I have an OC witch female I have wanted to play for a while and I am willing to share more details with you about her if you decide to PM or contact me!\n\nI have been roleplaying for over a decade now and I\u2019ve been in love writing as long as I remember. My main fandom is Marvel, but I\u2019m also very open to DC and Miraculous Ladybug ones. If we both find ourselves hitting it off and having fun writing together \u2013 I\u2019d be open to have more than one ship with you and we can build the entire world around it! I just would love to find a good friend in roleplaying partner with whom we both can always brainstorm ideas together about our characters.\n\nMy preferred length for replies is from 2 to 3 paragraphs, sometimes even more. I do love to get detailed and inside of my character\u2019s head quite a lot. I try to reply every single day and as often as I can although sometimes work or other things may get in my way.\n\nIf you\u2019ve got any questions, feel free to message me and let\u2019s discuss things together.",

            "selftext": "I want to play a story where I play your character\u2019s perfect wife or girlfriend, preferably one who accepts sexism and is absolutely devoted to your satisfaction in a selfless way. This means that she is not a horny sub but she doesn\u2019t really expect pleasure or satisfaction for her, and she does everything out of sheer love.\n\nHowever, I find it problematic to play characters that already know each other because synching on all previously shared details is impossible. So I have designed the following scenario, which is based on a sort of scifi premise but it doesn\u2019t mean the play itself will include any further scifi.\n\nOne day you are visited by a man. He tells you that for reasons beyond your understanding, you have been granted a wish by an alien civilization with technology so advanced that in your eyes will look like magic. He makes matter arrange itself into new and fully functional objects in front of you. He tells you that they can use that technology to give you a new life. Modify electronic records to create a bank account and even a new identity for you. Even create a human being with the characteristics that you want, as long as they are logically coherent. Their only limit is that it\u2019s too complex for them to change the mind of existing people, so they cannot make you famous or so rich that you would be well known. They cannot either change your own mind so if you want a person created for you, they cannot insert the shared memories they create fitting your description of the new person, and you will only know what you wrote in your description to them.\n\nHe tells you there is no moral limit in what you can describe (their morals have nothing to do with human ones) and that they will complete in what you would call good faith all the details that don\u2019t fit your description. If you create a person to be your girlfriend or wife, she will start existing believing she has always existed, once created she will be a completely real human being (not a simulation, not a robot) and she will believe that you have recently had a concussion, which would explain your gaps in memory, but doctors would have said that you will be able to remember things as they are being reminded to you again.\n\nTo avoid a snowball effect of having to create more people, she may be an orphan.\n\nSend me a description of what you want as if you wrote it to the aliens, and if it suits me I can play it for you.\n\nBefore that, please first read Section 1 in the pinned post in my profile, which describes the basics about how I roleplay. The rest of sections are recommended but not required.\n\nI am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+.\n\n&lt;PLOT DRIVEN NSFW&gt;",

I'm looking for someone who has few limits and is willing to play a canon character for me. My starter has him kind of out of character, so theres not really any standard I'd hold you to other than the theme of the starter. I legit had someone who was okay with something horrible who wasnt okay with this, which is kind of vanilla in comparison. So just be open minded. I'm looking for someone who can be the assertive type, but willing to play a different sort of character. If you're a macho man, I wouldnt try this. That's all I have to say about it, hopefully we can rp. Discord is my preferred platform, but I have kik as well although I dont chec it as often.",

            "selftext": "\n(It's very important to me that anyone interested read everything before messaging me. Thanks!)\n\n**About Me**\n\nAnyway! Hi, I'm Aterose and currently looking for a long term roleplay partner, though that much is obvious. I\u2019m a nineteen-year-old (twenty in a few months if that counts for anything) female living in the EST timezone. I have about 8-9 years of writing experience and consider myself pretty literate.\n\n**What I\u2019m Searching For**\n\n* Literacy. I prefer to roleplay with someone who can write at least two to three paragraphs minimum. The two of us should be going well over Discord's 2000 character limit.\n* Willing to chat OOC. I find it important to have a friendship with my partners as well as discussing future plots for our roleplay.\n* Must play both male and female characters.\n* Third-person only \n* Romance. Our roleplay won't revolve around romance but more so our plot. If our characters are hitting it off though I'm all for it.\n* Patience. I work 4-5 days a week so don\u2019t ask me when I\u2019m going to reply next, I can\u2019t stress this enough. \n* Finally I require you to not reply every day. An odd request but if I have a partner replying hours after my own reply I feel obligated to respond. As stated before I have a busy life. Please wait at least 24 hours before responding.\n\n**What I Will Not Do** \n\n* Smut (I prefer to fade to black)\n* Modern\n* Historic\n* Canon characters (From you or me) \n* Fandoms. Unless I have seen/read/played the fandom and the plot is good enough. This is a big maybe though. Roleplays inspired by fandoms is fine. \n\n**What I\u2019m Interested In**\n\n* Sandbox! I\u2019m all for sandbox. It leaves a ton of room to do whatever we want. I almost always do dystopian future settings and possibly some fantasy thrown in there.\n* One idea I have is not very detailed but we can figure it out along the way. The government has fallen due to a force we can discuss. There was chaos, death, and destruction. A large town/small city decided to come together and form their own government, only they couldn't come to an agreement as well so they split the city in half. Our characters are on opposite sides. We can decide what their goal is, whether that be putting an end to the dispute or something else. \n* Other than that I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m interested in right now, I\u2019ve been branching out due to partners having some pretty amazing ideas so I guess I\u2019ll just continue with that. Just throw whatever ideas you got at me and we can figure something out! Please suggest at least one idea when messaging me. \n\nIf you're interested or just have questions shoot me a message with your ideas and a little bit of information about yourself. I will not respond to chat requests or \"Still looking?\". Please DM only. Also, if you've read everything add your favorite color to your message. Hope to hear from you soon!",

            "selftext": "[F4M] Modern Slice of Life Roleplay\n\nHey! You can call me Suki. I\u2019m a Semi Lit to Lit Roleplayer who is currently searching for someone who would be willing to do a SOL Roleplay. Now, we can decide a Story and Characters ourselves! I love brainstorming an idea that my Partner would love, however I\u2019d like to make it stick to the following concept.\n\nMy main Idea was that the location would be an Urban place in Japan since I really just enjoy the aesthetic of that. Our characters could be together by any bond, relationship wise. I enjoy Romance and Drama in these sorts of Roleplay, so brainstorming that sort of stuff is fine too! \n\nA Few ideas I had were\n\nStudent and Teacher, \nRoommates, \nStudents, \nCo-workers, \nClose friends, \nVanilla Couple, \nSome sort of Tinder Date\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFirstly, I use Image References rather then describing my character, however, If you wish to use just a few sentences or a few paragraphs about yours, or an Image will do nicely. Currently I am in the mood to use an Anime one, if I do use an OC, so please be aware of that. Your own does not have to be Anime, you just have to be okay with mine of course! \n\nOn the other hand, The Canon Character pairings when I do play them, i\u2019m fine with all of them (OC x Canon, OC x OC and Canon x Canon) so you can play who you feel, even if it means crossover!\n\nLike I said earlier, all the details will be discussed in Private, and I only play on Discord, Wickr or Kik. This can go many ways in terms of plot. May it perhaps be Dark, or Rather Sweet. You obviously may choose what role you have, however if you are unsure I have a few suggestions in the back of my mind!\n\nMy Rules Are for you to only be able to write more then 6 Lines, or a Paragraph per response is preferable. Please don\u2019t come to me if you\u2019re looking for a Quickie for other Subreddits are for that sort of thing, however I am always fine with Smut as long as that isn\u2019t the sole purpose of the Roleplay.",

And sometimes, you want to write with someone else who'll write back! Here we are though, with a big week of Thanksgiving to just slack off (mostly).\n\nNow, I want to set some things in stone here, and tell you what I like, and don't like.\n\n**I LIKE:**  \nLiteracy: Listen, I hate using that word. It sounds pretentious, like the kinds of writers that scream at you if you get at least ONE error in punctuation. But, I like having both sides have all the proper stuff in English. If you make one or two mistakes, no worries, but if there's like seven in one paragraph, it ain't gonna work out.\n\nFantasy/Sci-Fi: Those two are my top dogs in terms of roleplay. You got a mage dude/dudette? Hell yeah. You got a bounty hunter with a cool but suffocating mask? Sold. I mean, I can work with about any type of roleplay, except modern and *heavy* romance, which I'll explain on the other section.\n\n**I DON'T LIKE:**  \nImpatience/Impoliteness: Should speak for itself. Be nice, be patient, and we'll get along fine.\n\nModern/Heavy Romance: I'm not very experienced with either, and I've never really taken a liking to them. I've always preferred more fictional writing, so I apologize if that's what you were looking for. I'm able to do romance, but none of that sappy gooey type of stuff, you dig?\n\nThat's about it! Please send me a DM if you're interested. Don't just leave a Discord tag though, tell me what you're interested in, what your ideas are, and what your time schedule/timezone is.",

I only RP over Discord or Google Docs.  \n\n\n**I am literate, friendly and creative. I typically post smaller posts compared to Novella\u2019s and typically aim for 300-500 words a post I write in the third person, past tense.** I work a lot and I find smaller posts easier to keep up with. I also post about every day to every two days, depending on my energy level and what my work schedule looks like. I also prefer someone who can be active. If I must wait over a week for a reply in a new RP, I tend to lose interest.  \n\n\n**If you have a habit of ghosting every RP, you\u2019re in, please don\u2019t respond to this ad.** **Please make sure you have time to RP before responding, I just don't want to ultimately waste my time with planning an RP that never gets off the ground. You shouldn't either.** I understand if interest gets lost, but I\u2019d honestly prefer just a simple note then to find myself blocked. I promise I\u2019ll understand, and I won\u2019t guilt-trip you. I always thank my partners for their time and understand that sometimes writing styles just don\u2019t clash, or other things come up.  \n\n\nSo, what am I looking for?  \n\n\n**I love romance. I love NSFW/Smut.** Of course, the entire RP wouldn\u2019t revolve around it, but preference goes to partners who also enjoy it. I\u2019d say about a 70/30 ratio would be implemented between Story/NSFW themes.  \n\n\nI am only looking for **Final Fantasy VII** right now! I am fine with canon's or OC's or a mixture. I am fine with anything in the universe. This could be a retelling, a retelling with OC's, an AU story or anything. I love the original game that I want to RP it. Fine with any pairings as well that stick to an M/F format.  \n\n\n**So that\u2019s it! If interested throw me a DM and we can go from there. Please do not use the 'chat' feature and just send me a message, thanks!**",

            "selftext": "(Posting this with my idle account and not my main.) \n\n\n(I am going to make this as coherent as possible. It doesn't have to make 100% sense to you as long as you see yourself in what I've tried to say and how I've explained the connection between our characters. Also my character is based on myself entirely both physically and personality wise.)\n\n\n*when all abuse was given with romance*\n\n\nI was known as the nice but adrift girl at college. Talking to most people but never having a fixed group, a fixed set of friends, no one knew about my family but just the fact that it's only been a little while ever since I've come to this town and I'm pretty much on my own. I look like I'm simply daydreaming often times. Sitting in my usual pair of jeans and a cropped top, the sun gently resting on my tan like complexion and fair face, making the curls stand out in my dark hair, my brown eyes fluttering their long lashes at something in the distance before I stop leaning back into my chair before I return to whatever I'm watching on my phone. Often giggling to myself too, the applies of my cheeks popping out every time I smile, little tiny arcs forming at the corners of my plump pink lips. As time passed by it became evident that I don't let any guy get too close to me, even when I have opportunities where I can go on a date with someone. Never staring back at any guy who's checking me out but always looking back at you whenever you do that. Looking up at you as I walk past you, being 5'3\" but curvy and thick. Having these soft doe eyed look that can turn to a teasing one so quickly, as I love being playful, and as you get to know me more, you find out that I'm a big tease.. but also a weird mix of guarded up and sensitivity.\n\n\nWhich perplexes you. You want to break through me as you love how clingy and incredibly affectionate I am. Knowing that you can turn my immense care and clinging factor into obsession, getting the sense that I'm hiding something. Hiding a part of me from you, which is unacceptable because you want to own all of me. You start to get more dominant, more intense, demanding more of my time and attention, starting to keep everything in my life in check. Often making me a little anxious and childish, but something never lets us part ways. \n\n\nOne day you see me crying about something and you realise that this part I've been keeping away from you is simply me not allowing myself to completely depend on you and become co dependent because I have these attachment issues, or we could go as far as to saying that I'm getting over an ex...\n\n\nBut I've still gotten quite addicted to your company like you have with mine, both of us not staying away from each other for long now that its been some time ever since we got together. Now that you've earned my trust... you can do what you want, what you've been waiting for, and show me your most pure and raw self. That you will cross any lengths to completely brain wash me and be mad for you. *anything* at all. It doesnt have to be typical Stockholm syndrome RP or a typical turning-me-into a slave rp, the possibilities are *endless* and we could talk all about it if you send me a msg.. I have a LOT of kinks and they get really messy.\n\n\nI have discord",

            "selftext": "Hi all, \n\nI'm a 19 year old girl from the wonderful US of A and have been roleplaying for a total of about five years now. Currently a sophomore in college, I work part-time as a college writing tutor. I'm hoping to find a literate male role-play partner, someone who can match my age or exceed it. My roles are almost always long-term and written in first person, at least paragraph responses. Additionally, I really appreciate a bond OOC. It makes it easier to communicate and make sure we're both having fun. I love to write, but I also love surprises and twists and turns, hence why I'd love to share something with you! Preferably taking place on Reddit or Discord, whichever you'd like!\n\nDelving deeper into what I'm here for, my favorite roles are usually sci-fi (demons, angels, monsters, apocalyptic, other magical races, space exploration, you name it!), romantic, and have some spicy drama. I'm no stranger to slice of life, though, and could easily be persuaded in that direction so long as there's an interesting dynamic. The most important thing to me is that my partner is literate and dedicated to making something work, developing a bond and extensive background for our characters, etc. \n\nLet's brainstorm together! Hope to hear from you soon, in your initial message let me know your favorite food. \n\nCheers!",

But one thing I find is that life always gets a little messy. Then, I lose my partners, due to lack of understanding.\n\nSo here's what I am searching for:\nOne,maybe two, genuine roleplayers where not only our styles match pretty nicely, but, we can always speak to each other. I want to become a friend of sorts. Someone who, I know, won't just uppity splits cause I disappear for a month or so. Someone who knows I will do the same. Someone who communicates to the best of their ability. But also, someone who isn't afraid to say \"hey I'm bored with this one. Wanna start something new?\"\nSo, yeah. A lifetime roleplay partner.\n\nTall, tall glass to fill. I KNOW. Buuuuut.... It's what I want.\n\nNow. To add all of that. I also want someone who isn't afraid to get down and dirty. Open to NSFW content. Not just the sexual aspects, buuuuut.... The other darker things. :) (this also means that 18+ is a must!) \n\nNow, as the title here says... Swashbuckling Madness.\nI have a very loose idea in my head about a pirate queen, a war, her capture, and meeting of a prince/navy captain. Or something like that. Again, very loose. But it does sound kind of enticing. Don't you think?\n\nAnother one I have recently thought about is a little heavier on the fantasy though. A world of science... A scientist... And his happening on a Phoenix. His disbelief. Her firey nature... Again. Loose ideas!\n\n\nAnywho. Please message me if all this sounds good! And put the word dimwit somewhere in your message so that I know you read this. \n\nKeep in mind... It is black Friday weekend and I do work in retail. I can't promise to get a reply to you fast. But I will as soon as I can!\n\nThanks for reading.",

            "selftext": "\nSome of you may recognize this as the plotline to Fallout: DUST. I had been getting back into the Fallout series, but I would really like to take a much darker, and I mean /darker/ spin to the story. DUST is an alternate timeline to Fallout New Vegas with a lot of dark content, a bleak atmosphere and many touchy topics that I think could make a great story. We can discuss it more in private but I am open to doing a story based on the Prelude to The Fall, the soldier of the civil war leading up to the outbreak or even the Aftermath where there are those trying to find a way to salvation! If you think you'd be interested in spinning a story of survival and waning hope then feel free to send me a message with whichever platform you prefer.  \n\n\n*Battle of Hoover Dam II*  \nTwenties years prior to the present day DUST, The Courier alongside the NCR take their final stand at the Hoover Dam. Essentially driving them back across the Colorado River and maintaining the Hoover Dam for the NCR. However, shortly after the end of the war, Courier Six attempted to seize control of the Mojave through use of the Securitrons under the NCRs noses. The battle between Courier Six and the NCR was brief before the NCR finally got the upperhand and forced the Courier into hiding, branding him a domestic terrorist and occupying the Vegas Strip by force. Removing the families from power and putting New Vegas under NCR jurisdiction. This move was seen very unfavorably by many in the Vegas area, The Kings pushing for insurrection within Freeside and the Strip leading to a civil war where many began to turn on the NCR as an oppressive occupier.  \n\n\n*The Vegas Civil War*\n\nThe Courier had become a figurehead of revolution to many people in and out of the Vegas area. The Kings starting a violent insurrection which forced the NCR to bring the Mojave under Martial Law. Curfews came into effect, heavy patrols were put out on the streets due to high threats of snipers and ambushes now under The King's influence. The NCR turned the Lucky 38 Casino into the base of operations for the new task force assigned with suppressing the insurrection, although under the eyes of any including their own chain of command operatives within the NCR discovered the location of the Sierra Madre. Turning Mr. House's old tomb into a brand new laboratory, the NCR brought their best scientists to begin retrieving samples of \"The Cloud\" and the bio-material of the Ghost People to see if they could reverse engineer it into bio-weapons and other experimental technology to bring back to California and turn the tide of the war. The war was seeing little progress on either end for the past five years, though Vegas Residents were disappearing regularly now and being last spotted being taken prisoner within the Lucky 38 for unknown reasons. A radio broadcast from California soon reached the task force, warning of a sandstorm approaching The Mojave and an evacuation being recommended for all NCR citizens.  It wasn't until their was an sudden breach within the Lucky 38, the Cloud samples had been released and formed a second storm within The Strip that was quickly overtaking the area. Due to the experimentation from the NCR Scientists the Second Cloud was far more horrid than the original and had begun turning much of The Vegas Strip and Freeside inhospitable.  \n\n\n*The Fall*\n\nTerror and chaos as the Cloud Began engulfing The Strip. The NCR began executing citizens without discrimination due to how many were exposed and turning into twisted creatures of The Cloud. Those who could were escorted through the Monorail for evacuation. The Kings rebellion had their last gun fight against the NCR, before being driven down to the sewers of Freeside to save those they could from the coming Cloud. Radio broadcasts urging anyone still alive to flee underground where they'd be promised shelter and supplies, the rest were doomed to death after the NCR locked down all gates within The Strip and Freeside. Had they not made it into the old casinos they were forced to succumb to the Cloud.  \n\n\n*The Dust Storm*\n\nMost NCR and Rebel Operatives didn't even get the broadcast when the Cloud broke out and evacuation came into effect, the Dust Storm saturated with radiation swept across The Mojave and devastated the lands. Those who didn't flee to immediate shelter or had proper equipment were killed or turned into Ghouls quickly, some operatives of the NCR on the outside managed to lead a convoy into Zion Valley. Though they went dark soon after with their fate being unknown, the last message sent out being reports of Spores sprouting along the valley.  \n\n\n*The End*  \nJust as Ulysses predicted, the Divide cracked and the Tunnelers moved to the West. The Cloud and Storm blot out the sun forever, allowing them to travel on surface and devour much of the human and animal population. With most food being scarce and those settlements still being hospital under the control by unknown forces or remnants of the NCR unable to evacuate, many turned to murder and cannibalism were they unable to store enough food. The NCR still within New Vegas have issued a shoot on sight for any survivors still found in the area, and signs of evac have not been seen. All that remains are clues as to some people who may still be operating within New Vegas, maps to potential escape routes and the Broadcast from the King's Rebellion.",

            "selftext": "Hello there! Anyone is welcomed here as long as you're at least 18+. \n\nI just wanted to keep things straight forward! I have been tuned in with these characters and I have a love for them and the show. Though I will say that I am in the third arc for JoJo, and haven't gotten too far.\n\nI hope that doesn't restrict anyone in wanting to write with me. But, it was always on my mind to write something out for one of these two.\n\nI am naturally laid-back I don't get on your head about replying or where you've gone. If you're busy than no worries from me! As long as you let me know beforehand so I don't get too worried where you ran off too. I'm always chipper so I like to chat even outside that. However, if you just want us to use that to just speak about ideas than that is totally okay. It is encouraged that we talk and plan!\n\nI am totally down with mood boards, never made one but I'd love to help and or see what you can do! I love to headcanon, and even vent about our characters together.\n\nI want the subgenre to be romance, or even that can be the full plot. But, I don't wish to rush anything at all. We can take a twist to the story, and write them out in AUs such as a more Slice of Life, or even a Supernatural Twinge. \n\nI will admit I favorite MxM but, I am fine with everything else! But, I will not write FxM (with me as female.) But, I will write MxF though, sorry if that's confusing. I mean that I'll play the male character. FxF is fine too, but not sure if I can write as a female character from either anime.\n\nI prefer quality over quantity, but I want at least two paragraphs. Just try in your responses, I understand things can be slow in terms of plot so sometimes that works. Just give your best effort, please!\n\nHere are the character's from each anime that I would love writing as.\n\nJojo's Bizarre Adventure-\n\nJoseph Joestar: to which I ship with Caesar. I can ship him with anyone, and even an OC if they aren't too strange. I usually hate OCs but why not try?\n\nCaesar Zeppeli, Jonathan Joestar, and maybe Polnaerff.\n\nMy Hero Academia-\n\nFor this one my list is slightly bigger but:\n\nIida Tenya, Bakugou Katsuki, Todoroki, and Kaminari. I can ship them with anyone as long as they are the same age, and there is nothing between family. An OC can also work, but by all means.\n\nI won't make Katsuki as much of a bully, and I hope you aren't expecting me to make him abusive or yelling.\n\nWe can discuss the platform we will be using, but I won't use kik. I may be persuaded to give my discord if we really seem to click.\n\nLastly, **Message me telling me about yourself and what you plan to seek from this RP.** I won't answer any replies that don't seem like they're trying. Not to sound rude but, really I want people who care to message me and maybe then we can have a great time writing. I will reply to everyone that makes any effort but lazy replies will be ignored unfortunately. \n\nI'll introduce myself right back, hopefully I didn't sound like a jerk!",

Anyways, onto the idea.\n\nDouble Trouble and Catra are spending time together and just hanging out for a while. Double Trouble starts amusing Catra with transformations, but as they turn into Adora or Scorpia for a bit, something hits Catra in this moment. She walks to Double Trouble as they're in their regular form, and quickly kisses their cheek and asks them to be with her. They think on it for a bit, and eventually agree to it. So, over the course of a couple days or so, Catra constantly asks Double Trouble to turn into Adora or Scorpia. Double Trouble complies, only wanting to entertain her and being happy with her smile. Eventually, Double Trouble starts getting iffy with it.\n\nWe can discuss other potential ideas in a chat. If this idea intrigues you, feel free to message me.",

            "selftext": "They spoke of peace, of order.  They spoke of a galaxy free of evil and the vile influence of the Sith. The Jedi Order promised us a place in this paradisal vision of theirs, all we had to do was follow their rules.  To a force-sensitive child with no real future, it seemed the choice was obvious.\n\nWe did as we were told.  We followed their rules and did our best to be what they wanted us to be until the day came when we could no longer discern the darkness from the light.  Peacekeepers became generals, scholars became warriors, and the beacon of hope that the Jedi Order once embodied became a standard of bloodshed and war.  \n\nWe, still only padawans, could sense the fall of the order before even our masters.  Unwilling to take part in violent means to meet the superficial ends the council wished to meet, we abandoned our temple and the Jedi Order.  Armed with only our lightsabers and a cursory knowledge of the Force, we began wandering the galaxy in search of a greater purpose more noble than being pawns in a war with no potential for a clear victor.  Step one, though, is finding a place to sleep where the Jedi Order can\u2019t find us...\n\n\nHello!  If you\u2019ve made it this far I can only assume my hook has grabbed your attention and I\u2019ve succesfully trapped my next roleplay victim!  Ahem... partner!  \n\nMy main interest for this plot is adventure, action, and character development.  I prefer any romance that may take place to be slow-burn.  Our characters have known one another since they were children, the idea of romance may or may not have occurred to them yet but if/when it does it will probably be difficult for them to express their feelings to such a close companion.  \n\nYour character will be entirely yours, the only stipulation I make is that our characters knew one another when they were younglings at the Jedi temple.  They were given to different masters but kept in contact with one another.  When the clone wars began the reunited and ran away together.  Other than that, go crazy!\n\nI\u2019m looking for a partner of a similar skill level to my own as well as someone with the intention/inclination to make replies often and of a quality which is indicative of a passionate writer.  A healthy love and knowledge of the star wars universe helps as well!\n\nAt the peril of appearing snobbish to many of you (and perhaps relatable to a smaller minority of you) I do ask that any interested parties send a sample of their RP in a DM.  I have been paired once too often with partners that couldn\u2019t keep up with me and its resulted in a lot of great plots going down the proverbial drain as I slowly lose interest in carrying the story single-handedly along.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested please DM me and we can get to talking about the finer details!  Keep in mind, I gotta like your writing but I also gotta like you so make a good impression!  I look forward to meeting you partner!",

            "selftext": "Holiday break is coming up and I'm looking for a long-term partner for some collaborative story-telling. I am open to some amount of fandom inclusion, but we'd have to talk about that. (My fandom interests are Sherlock Holmes, Sense8, Hannibal, Marvel, and Harry Potter). Ultimately, I'd like to find someone over the age of 21 with a decent amount of writing experience, who has an interest in crafting a plot and characters with me. \n\nI am open to playing multiple characters and exploring a variety of relationships (I tend to play MxM if there is any NSFW content, but I am open to any other pairings -- romantic, sexual, or otherwise). \n\nWhile I don't have a lot of fantasy / sci-fi experience, I would be open to these genres if playing opposite to a person who feels comfortable taking control of world-building. \n\nAs far as posting goes, I'm a busy dude. I have a lot going on and can't promise a post every day, and I would like to find a partner who understands that some days might bring inspiration and multiple posts, but other days I just won't get around to posting at all. Either way, I'll try to be in communication in some way. Post length is up to you. Whatever you need to get the job done, as long as you aren't leaving out details to be lazy or posting paragraphs of superfluous detail. Just write well, please. \n\nI'd honestly prefer Google Docs, as it allows more freedom when posting. Discord mobile makes me nuts, and I'm more likely to reply often if we use docs. But if Discord is your jam, I can make it work. \n\nMy big no's:\n\nDon't write overly traumatized characters and ask me to care-take. I know that trauma and mental health are easy ways to make a character *stand out*, but make sure it has a purpose in the plot rather than being the entire plot. \n\nDon't expect to jump right into something steamy. Like I said, I'm down for NSFW. But it needs to be a slow build. \n\nWhile I enjoy angst, it needs to be done well. I don't want to have to chase your character through the ground, all of the way to China because *angst*! \n\nDon't write my character for me. No godmodding. Some actions can be assumed, and I'm going to assume that you know what I mean, but don't make big decisions of character for me. I'll treat your characters with the same respect. \n\nI don't do anime anything.\n\n\nReach out if interested.",

            "selftext": "Hello! Before I go into detail about this, I have to say that I do not support any wars anywhere in the world and it is not something to romanticize whatsoever. However, I will contradict this strong belief in this roleplay I would like to do! \n\nI am thinking of having a country that is divided by two states trying to establish their own lands where one state is more powerful than the other while the other struggles to even keep their divided side of the land. One state will be more evil in terms of abuse of their power and the other will be the powerless one where no harm is coming from in comparison to the opposing side. Both states will have the same belief that they own the land with its every square inch, therefore there will be strong opposition between one another. Now for the characters, you guessed it; I would like to have one character on the powerful side who could be a soldier with weapons and an army or just another citizen, meanwhile on the other side, a character who fights with rocks, active in protests and vocal on social media about the issues her side of the land face against the more powerful and forceful side. They could possibly meet in a protest where one can get hurt from the other, something of that sort and from there on, we can plan an exciting romance! \n\nI would love for my partner to be able to drive scenes and make things happen, don't be afraid to create conflicts and action; I love a partner who can take equal part in the formation of the plot as there isn't a fixed direction this will go. If you're interested, please message me so we can start this on Discord! \n\nThanks for reading!",

            "selftext": "This thread contains spoilers for Terminator: Dark Fate. \n\nHello again, Reddit!\n\nI took a break from roleplaying for a bit as I transitioned to graduate school and my new job. However, last night I saw the newest Terminator movie and got the craving to Roleplay again. \n\nSpecifically, I really loved the character Grace and would love to play as her against your character. I would prefer to play her against a female love interest (or platonic friends) as that was the vibe I got from her during the film, however I am not opposed to playing her against a male character. \n\nDisclaimer: this is the only Terminator film I\u2019ve seen, however I am somewhat familiar with the franchise as I researched it prior to seeing the movie. \n\nAbout me: I\u2019m a 24 year old woman in graduate school with a part time job that takes up quite a bit of time. I do make time for Roleplays, and fit them into my life, so I usually respond pretty frequently. I tend to write about 2-3 paragraphs per post in third person past tense. \n\nAbout the Roleplay: I would be okay with taking the rp AU and going against the ending of the film where Grace dies, possibly trapping her in the present world. Or we could have it take place in the future where Grace is from. \n\nHonestly, if you\u2019re interested at all in rping in this world, send me a pm and we can chat and brainstorm.",

            "selftext": "Noises and smells fill the air of the market as I walk past the creatures and humanoid like creatures, my armor glinting off the bright sun that burns down onto the large bustling city. People giving me a wide berth, some a bit more polite to me and others of my tribe. Our upbringing making us the finest warriors and mercs across the galaxy. I walk into a seedier part of town, my hand a bit closer to my blaster as I near my destination. \n\nThis place both a home and a prison to me, I always say this is my last bounty, but I always come back. Was it the adventure that makes me keep taking these missions? Credits are never the issue, living on my bare bones ship and basically living in my impregnable armor. So what keeps me coming back to this life? My mind filled with these thoughts as I near a door, a wand with a scanner on the end comes out. I hold up a card and it scans it, opening the door and I walk in. Stepping past and around creatures as I near the bar, tossing two credits down for the bartenders attention. It waves me to walk to the back as I give it a nod and head back. \n\nI see a person sitting in a darkened room, only his outline visible as his smile shines in the low light.\n\n'Mathius, welcome back. I assume you filled your bounties?' I take a small leather sack out and toss the bounty pucks at him. The holograms coming up with CAPTURED [ALIVE] on some but most with CAPTURED [TERMINATED] on the hologram. He chuckles to me and slides a small pile of credits over to me.\n\nI ask from behind my helmet 'do you have more work?' the person shakes his head 'not alot, your burning through bounties faster then I am getting them, I have other hunters I have to feed' I shake my head as his face reflects off my mirrored visor of my helmet. \n\"Not my problem, do you have work or do I need to visit your brother on Qualox? I hear he is paying well for bigger missions'\n\nHe slams a puck down hard on the table, as he removed his hand I grab it and he grabs my armored wrist, my other hand grabs my minisaber and I pull it quickly. Two guards step from the shadows and press two blasters to my head as he whispers\n\"Tsktsktsk, your temper is going to get you killed some day Mandalorian' \nI growl a little 'just give me the damn bounty and I can get you paid you welp\"\nHe lets go of my wrist and I stand up, the puck hologram flickering to life but the image is badly distorted. A clear image flashing for only a moment as I tilt my head to him \n\"Is this a joke? I can't verify my target with this, do you atleast have a tracking fob?' he slides it over and looks at me \"that's your target, you will get more info when you near your target'\nI scoff as turn and walk out of the room\n\n\n*** Hey! Thanks for reading, if you made it this far, hopefully you would be interested and writing a story with me! Basically this is going to go off the idea of the Miniseries The Mandalorian, not plot for plot but just that part of the Star Wars universe! Your character can be whatever you prefer her to be! Could be a Jedi! A rogue empire officer! Or whatever!",
