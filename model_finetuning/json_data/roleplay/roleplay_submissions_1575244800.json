I don\u2019t really care how much you write, just as long as it\u2019s moving the story forward, but preferably stay away from one liners and very short posts. I know everyone makes mistakes but I would like to be able to understand the basic content of your messages.

            "selftext": " Hello, my name is Roxy. I've been roleplaying for nearly 6 years now, but that doesn't mean I'm an expert nor will I ever be. Generally, I liked relaxed roleplay. This means I don't worry too much about spelling, grammar, or word count. So, if you care way too much about it I might not be the person for you (I'm human and make mistakes).\n\nI mainly play as my OC for my main role, but I'll gladly play as other roles on the side to help the story. However, I don't want to be the only one puppeting a bunch of people without reason. You can play as whoever you want, as long as your comfortable and happy with the decision.\n\nAs for plot ideas, I'm unsure at the moment. I usually see how it plays out at first and then either wing it or I get some big ideas that I want to try. I love all genres, so don't be afraid to say you don't like one or really want to try one. As long as both of us like it, there are no issues.\n\nAt the moment, I am looking for a fandom roleplay. These are the fandoms;   \n\\- Marvel; Spiderman and/or Venom   \n\\- DC; Teen Titans (young or older version) and Batman (any era and universe)  \n\\- Devil May Cry (Have not played 5 yet)\n\nYou can offer other fandoms if you have some you like. These are just ones I'm in the mood for.   \nIf you're interested, please contact me through Reddit. Don't ghost without warning, I understand if people are busy though.",

Stories have spread, creatures haunting the shadows and preying on anyone foolish enough to start out after nightfall.\n\nSomething bigger is coming, makes what we have seen look like a fluffy bunny.\n\nThat's where we come in. There isn't an official name yet, but a few agents have called us Damocles. A sword ready to fight against these unnatural being: one part soldier, one part sorcerer.\n\nWe've pushed back against this other world at great cost. Chief says we have some new blood coming in today, just in time. Report came in, I'm supposed to bring the rookie along, see what we can uncover, and eliminate it.\n\nI'm in the east coast US time zone and prefer to use Discord.",

I am currently looking for people who are detailed and   literate for some long term plot oriented rps. You must have a   passion\u00a0for rp and show that you are willing to be detailed. I am  looking for this rp to be gripping, story focused with consequences and  tough choices to make. I have a plot idea in mind listed below however i  am looking for someone to help me flesh this idea out to it's full  potential.\n\nRules:\n\n1. Be detailed\n2. Dont write my characters for me\n3. Be literate\n4. I WILL NOT RESPOND TO LOW EFFORT REPLIES! SERIOUS REPLIES ONLY!\n\nPlot:\n\nSlice of life idea: I play as your daughter. You are a single parent who has dedicated his/her entire life to raising me and making sure i turn out okay. However, things get a little rocky when your character meets someone from their past and falls in love instantly. You have to work to decide what is right. Will you abandon your daughters feelings for this new partner? Will you abandon the idea of finding love again? Or will you perhaps find a way of making the two get along?\n\nIf  you  have any questions please feel free to ask. Please DM me on reddit  so  we can discuss where to rp. Please put the word \"purple\" in your   opener so i know you read the rules. (SERIOUS REPLIES ONLY!)",

I've had couple of roleplays in this setting that turned out really well, and I've had the incredible urge to try and replicate that success. So, simply put, I just need **18+ people**, male or female, who would be potentially interested in building up this world with me!\n\nHere are some of my caveats:  \n\\-**18+** Like I stated above. This is mainly story based, but yes, occasional adult themes can pop up, so better to be safe than sorry  \n\\-**Third-person only.** I don't hate first person, but this simply makes things smoother. This is usually not a big deal, but I know some people only like to write in first.  \n**-Competent writing.** This is probably the biggest point on here. Everyone has different levels of roleplaying, and I'm searching for the more nuanced way. At the same time, I'm flexible. As long as you can put together a coherent response, I'm most likely game.\n\nIf you want to try it or simply find out some more information, PM me, and I can give you my Discord ID. Cheers!\n\n**I\u2019m still looking!**",

I try to stay away from OCs but as long as you're not just writing yourself I don't mind. \n\nHit me up in a pm if you're interested :)\n\nThe writing is very old but if u want some writing examples you can look at spencxreid.tumblr.com.

            "selftext": "I finally got into MHA, and I am finishing up season 3 currently. I created an OC that I would love to flush out. My OC, Maku, can cause intense pain in an opponent with his quirk (triggers pain indicators in people without any physical cause), but the side effect is that he has to deal with a partial amount of the pain himself over a period of time, making him almost constantly in pain. He is the leader of a \u201ccrime\u201d organization, their mission is to reorganize the government structure of Japan; a bit of a communist revolution, you could say. Your character will be a new member to the organization, taken in because of your unique quirk. You specialize in some type of healing quirk, and will be at Maku\u2019s side most the time due to his overwhelming dependence on medicine/drugs. Other than having a somehow medicinal-related quirk (and having a male OC, sorry) you can make your OC whatever you want. Would prefer rp to be a slow burn romance, too.\n\nYou must write in 3rd person and have responses that can match me, my responses can range from a few paragraphs to a few sentences. I expect effort, not someone who does not push the plot forward or does not give me stuff to work with. The biggest problem I\u2019ve had in roleplaying is when people rely on me for all the interest in the story and don\u2019t take time to add some character to their own responses. I really never do fights scenes and I assume it is difficult to avoid in a MHA roleplay, so I apologize beforehand for my lack of knowledge in that. I also suck at responding in a consistent manner, but usually I can do at least one response a day. I use Discord or Kik. Please PM me if interested!\n\nI am interested in any rp you might have to offer, so if you don\u2019t like my idea, there\u2019s still a chance I might like yours. I would especially love to play as Eraserhead in a rp, so definitely shoot me up if you\u2018re interested.",

If you\u2019d like romance, then you need to know that I\u2019ll be playing a female, so unless you are okay with a FxF pairing, I advise you to use a male character.\n\nThat\u2019s all.

I've had couple of roleplays in this setting that turned out really well, and I've had the incredible urge to try and replicate that success. So, simply put, I just need **18+ people**, male or female, who would be potentially interested in building up this world with me!\n\nHere are some of my caveats:  \n\\-**18+** Like I stated above. This is mainly story based, but yes, occasional adult themes can pop up, so better to be safe than sorry  \n\\-**Third-person only.** I don't hate first person, but this simply makes things smoother. This is usually not a big deal, but I know some people only like to write in first.  \n**-Competent writing.** This is probably the biggest point on here. Everyone has different levels of roleplaying, and I'm searching for the more nuanced way. At the same time, I'm flexible. As long as you can put together a coherent response, I'm most likely game.\n\nIf you want to try it or simply find out some more information, PM me, and I can give you my Discord ID. Cheers!\n\n**I\u2019m still looking!**",

            "selftext": "The world of Terresia is under assault by the Devourer, a being of unknown origin which seeks to consume its mana and leave it barren. A guild named Ad Libitum exists throughout the remnants of the world to protect it from the consuming monster, though not so successful. As a last resort, the world's life-giving tree uses the last of its power to create two beings called Descenders, which are born to protect the world who gave it birth. These two, after being awakened by a strange creature fairy-like creature named Lily  whose own world was destroyed by the same threat, learns of the danger to the world's World Tree. Now joining Ad Libitum, these two will be doing all they can to save this world from the face of destruction.\n\nHello again and congrats if you have read all of it. Recently I have been playing tons of the game Tales of the World: Radiant Mythology and thought I would make an rp based in the world. Though of course this rp will be different to help with people who don't know of the game or the series as the characters will be different from the original game. Other then, I will be going into more detail with whoever I end up roleplaying with. Also if you want, we can only have one Decender and you could possibly just be a member of Ad Libitum or someone who decided to visit the World Tree in search of some answer to the Devourer.\n\nNow I guess to get to some info on partner stuff and other things, for the sort of person I'm looking for when roleplaying is at least three paragraphs and is decent at detailing things. Along with that, I roleplay in the third person too. And to note, I do like to play more than one character from time to time so if you do too, all the more fun.\n\nNow I do have a life so there will be at times where I will be busy I do tend to keep updates on my situation so that you may know how it is and when I may be free or busy. Last thing though, please at least be 18 or older since I don't exactly like the thought of roleplaying with a minor and am more comfortable with that.\n\nFor location and timezone stuff, United States and my timezone is EST.\n\nIf you're interested or have any questions, just message me. Don't be a stranger!",

Further on this is the fact I would like to play an OC. During the roleplay I can play CC, such as Lestrade etc to progress plot. Lastly, before I spill the plot, I\u2019m looking for at least one paragraph (no, two sentences don\u2019t count as a paragraph.) I would love to do a fully literate rp. Hope you\u2019re interested, plot points can be change, everything is open to debate. \n\nHow Sherlock met her was complicated, she was an ex-spy, he a detective. She made a body, he solved the crime. It\u2019s quite simple. \n\nEvelyn has the intelligence with the heart, the heart is frozen but still got a fire trying to break free. That\u2019s how it began, if he could do a controlled experiment regarding emotion, maybe he would be able to manipulate then better. \n\nThat\u2019s why their strange friendship began.",

Like all final tests, your squad and all others taking the test was overseen by some of the best the Republic had. \n\nFor this test the overseers were none other than Commander Cody of the 212th, And Commander Brayec of the 87th sentinel corps. Brayec was a well known leader, the first non clone and non Jedi to lead a clone legion. He joined the republic for reasons unknown to those outside the Jedi council but as he proved himself in the battle of Geonosis was given a position alongside Jedi master Taya and her padawan. \n\nCody and Brayec were searching for squads to recruit into their respective legions. An honor it would be to be part of either.  \n\nYour clone type, name and all is up to you! I\u2019ve been rewatching the clone wars and am looking for a good clone wars story. Keep in mind I\u2019m also willing to do other related stories as long as the era is clone war. Thanks!",

All I ask is that you write something I can reply to.\n\nI had plotted out an idea but the person ghosted. Id love to play it out and see where it goes. The gist was that a witch/magic user was being hunted by a group who's goal is to eliminate all super natural. A werewolf who was tired of being hunted and had been living in the woods saved the witch and they up end going to take down the organization that is hunting them. Clique, I know but I love slow burn romances especially when there is fighting involved. I'd really love for them to both female but I'm ok with any gender pairing.\n\nIf you have any ideas\u00a0let me know and we can make something up. I love the ideas of supernatural creatures and slice of life. I only ask for a plot that's not smut centric. Honestly, I prefer to fade to black when the situation arises.\n\nI have a kik and discord if you like and I have done RPs through email too. DM me and we can exchange information.\n\nAnd just a heads up- I work full time second shift (so afternoon to late night). I also have health issues so I'm not available all the time but I try my best to let my partners know and to reply once every few days if not every day.",

I've got one as well. I don't like doubling just to set up predetermined romantic pairs, but I would like to play some canon characters and expect my partner to take up at least one.

I very flexible with scenes and do have a few ideas but given that they have become a bit stale i am hoping to find someone to build a scene with. I am also looking for someone who is around 25+ years of age given there can be adult content and because im looking to find someone who is a bit more mature. ( i am 30 so ya )\n\nMy ideal partner is someone who is detailed, creative, and descriptive willing to write at least 1 or 2 paragraphs and who is understanding of busy schedules i have moments where i can write a lot and other moments where i can be a bit slow\n\nIf your interested please DM me with any scene ideas you have or characters you like to play! I typically like to RP on discord so if we click i would be more than willing to share my info\n\nAny way! Hope to hear from you soon!!\n\n( I am a tad busy at least right now it is so if i dont reply right away thats why.i will respond ASAP )",

Years ago a German born Russian man was shot, the bullet moved just a bit to the left and missed his heart, that man went on to become a celebrated genetic scientist in the Soviet union, creating artificial life, it was a secret for a long time, but in 1998 an article was published by an underground paper that exposed these things for what they were, including a full list of names, and even some photos, it ruined many lives, but something like this couldn\u2019t be covered up, these things could be spotted by their violet eyes, while at first was thought to be a genetic issue now turns out to be an entirely different species of humans.\nMany of these things had family\u2019s with humans, relationships with children friends and work, in a week it was gone, families destroyed, lives ruined.\nThey were moved to a new subsection off Moscow simply called \u2018South city\u2019 the men were reduced to work labour and many women worked as maids or other less than desirable jobs, to some humans they were fetishized, to most they were just animals.\n\nIt was said that there are no murderers in the soviet union, such things are such an American mindset, it helped those like this assassin you contacted, they swept it under the rug, Your brother was shot in the head? He spit in the face of an officer is what the report would say.\n\nChecking your watch you found your way to the neon lights of the Vishka bar, the noise of the drunkards and the smell of tobacco of the group smoking outside, turning into they alleyway you could see the old military escort vehicle sitting there, the passenger side door was left unlocked for you.\nThis was it, there was no backing out now.\n(You can choose anyone to be the target, I personally recommend this character hiring the assassin is a temp, and to have your main character either the target, or an associate of said target.\nThe start of this story after the meeting will focus a bit on the assassin (Me) up until meeting with the target, so you will need to be able to play more than one character.",

Bear with me please, I\u2019m new to this place...\nOkay, I guess I should start with telling you a little bit about me? \nI\u2019m 18f, currently living in Central Europe. I\u2019ve been roleplaying for about 6 years and it\u2019s one of my favorite hobbies.\nI\u2019m mostly used to fantasy rps of all kind, but clone wars has been a big part of my childhood as well as the other star wars movies.\nI\u2019ve had trouble finding partners for this since the newer sw movies are far more popular nowadays, but I thought I might give it a shot here. I mainly use discord for rp, tho.\n\nAnyway, I have a character made for this, but I\u2019m definitely willing to make a new one or change some things!\nYou don\u2019t have to be super informed about the lore or ships or anything - as long as you appreciate the series/characters and are up to try this with me, I would love to hear from you!\nIn terms of timeline - We could go anywhere from beginning, middle or towards the end of the clone wars, I really don\u2019t mind.\n\nYour character can be anything! A jedi, sith, a clone, a senator, bounty hunter, Padawan, pirate, droid, canon character - I won\u2019t be picky. I just really want us both to have fun with this and get along well.\nFor reference, the character I made would either be a padawan/young jedi. But yea I\u2019m willing to start fresh on character creation, too.\n\nIf you made it this far, I applaud you.\nIf you\u2019re interested, even better! I\u2019d be super happy to hear from you, in the comments or in pm.",

            "selftext": "**Hello**, I am looking for a creative and devoted person to GM a roleplay for me. I'm hoping to do something in the My Hero Academia Universe. I'd prefer to have our setting in America Hero School.  Looking for character development, Story arcs, Romance / Action-Adventure.   I write in third person. Normally two paragraphs. \\[Examples Below\\] \n\n I currently have basic characters concepts from the following Quirks.\n\n* Wind Element \n* Pyrokinesis \n* Animal Shifter \n\n\\[Basic Info includes - personality, hobbies, family, a bit of backstory.\\] \n\nIf you'd be interested in GMing for me.  **Message Me.**\n\n\\-Thanks\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Roleplay examples below are from a MHA 'Double' Roleplay I've done recently.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*  **Roleplay Example 1**\n\nKayari pushed herself off the way and darted towards the cloned shapes. She just needed to touch them to spread her flames cross their body. \u20181,2,3\u2019 were engulfed with flames when she made contact with them. Two got past her. She reached out to race her fingers along the nearest wall. She closed her eyes for a moment and the flames on her body went out. When she opened her eyes they were no longer glowing. She moved away from the teacher and Todoroki her fingers staying in contact with the wall. She was looking for the nearest opening or doorway to get into. They cut off the power and made her overuse her quirk. She could hardly see anything now. Not that she would admit to her drawback.   \n\nShinso thought the girl had a rather cool quick compared to most others in his class. She probably could of got into the Hero study class but maybe she had no tried enough. He had never asked her goal or motivation and he - well most the class had known about his disdain for being looked down upon. It seemed Present Mic made no attempt to follow of stop them. He quickly led her away from the building they had trapped him on. \u201cOnce we spot the kid. I\u2019ll ask it a question - so it\u2019s no insufferable to deal with.\u201d He didn\u2019t get along with people, let alone kids. The girl with any modification of her quirk would likely scare the child shitless. He could easily ask if it wanted candy or something and get a reply. Then mind control it onto pleasant submission. \u201cAfter that we should look for the man in immediate danger.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Roleplay Example 2** \n\n \"Of course.\" She said with a small smile and a roll of her eyes he couldn't see. She squeezed his hand her so slightly. As they slipped out the door back into the light she felt blinded all over again while her eyes adjusted. \"You should freeze the door.\" She could have melted the door shut but she didn't want to screw up her vision up further. \"Oh,\" She let go of his hand but not trying to make a bid deal out of it. There was no longer any need or excuse to be holding it. \"Which way?\" She could still see general shapes even of her vision was a bit blurry. She couldn't tell which way they had come from and which they should be going. She would need to rely on him for a short while. He was Endeavors son, if she should entrust anyone with her well being it should he him, right?  \n\n Ten? A bit older than he'd first expected. At least crying child was not in the cards. Luckily for them both. As they approached he asked a simple question. \"Are you alright?\" He wouldn't need to use his mind control power and the kid answered his question. The kid roleplayed out a scene where he pretended he ran away from home. Shinso thought they might need his power after all because the younger boy seemed reluctant to come with them. \"I'm sure your parents are worried about you. Why else would heroes be scouting the city to find you.\" He noted. At that the boy agrees to return home. He looked to his classmate. \"That was easy enough.\" More so than he expected. \"Can you find anyone else?\" He asked. There was the man in immediate danger still they would need to locate. A hostage was often held for a ransom so the women should be okay for a while. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Roleplay Example 3**\n\n As he seemed to read her mind she lowered her eyes but didn\u2019t respond. She stood frozen in place as he presumably ice the door over what the sound she could hear. Her quirk drawback was kinda of a pain in the ass and it was embarrassing. She hadn\u2019t been able to work on lengthening the time until the effect kicked in. Largely because it wasn\u2019t until recent years her parents agreed to support her dream of becoming a hero. Which meant she hadn\u2019t used her quirk too much growing up. Not that the government looked kindly on those who used their quirks without express consent. She was lost in her own thoughts when he spoke. She nodded her head in understanding but said nothing. It seemed now that she was more of a burden then useful but at least he wasn\u2019t like Bakugo making fun of her for it. \u201cThank you.\u201d She mumbled almost inaudible.   \n\nShinso felt a warmth rush to his face from her strange way of complimenting him. He should probably boast but it wasn\u2019t really in his nature. He just nodded and turned slightly away - he preferred it when his face remained expressionless. It was not like he hadn\u2019t received compliments before. So why was he having this reaction now? No matter. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have been able to locate him as quickly without you.\u201d He reminded. He turned back as she caught onto something and he started to move in that direction. \u201cSomething?\u201d He asked a bit unsure with the vagueness of her statement. He kept glancing over to her mostly to take in those odd things about her appearance. He wondered if she had been teased in their younger years. He actually didn\u2019t know too much about her even though they were classmates. In time he would have to change that.",

            "selftext": "Hey there fellow role players! I\u2019m searching for someone to satisfy a particular role play urge I haven\u2019t had in a while. I recently got back into the Voltron series on Netflix (yes that one), and realized how much I freaking adored everyone\u2019s favorite space prince Lotor... and really want to do a great RP centered around him, with adventure, romance, and the like. \n\nBasically it would be Lotor x OC. I\u2019m looking for someone to play Lotor, as I can\u2019t write male characters too well myself. The last time I did this RP, I wrote as an OC that was part of the Altean colony who was one of the rare few born with Altean magic. Lotor takes an interest in her and rather than drain her of Quintessence like the other colonists, he spares her life and takes her as a partner of sorts. In exchange for helping to hone her powers, he teaches her Altean history and of the heritage her people have long forgotten. Over time however, he starts to see her as less of an asset and someone that he genuinely comes to love and care for. \n\nSounds interesting? If so, you\u2019ll need to be 18+ in case other themes come up, and also willing to RP only on Discord, since that is where I do the majority of my online RP these days. I don\u2019t expect novel length paragraphs but at least try to match my responses and give me good stuff to work with. \n\nLiteracy? I\u2019d highly appreciate that too. At least be literate enough to not use chat speak during RP and have writing ability. I\u2019m not looking for a Shakespeare, but at the very least someone who has equal interest in developing a good story and seeing it through. \n\nYou\u2019d be getting a new friend out of this too, as I do enjoy befriending my RP partners, bouncing off ideas and sharing the occasional silly memes. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested, toss me a message so we can exchange Discord info and discuss further!",

The war ended in a peace treaty, and both powers have been vying for diplomatic supremacy until what's viewed as an inevitable resumption of hostilities. Meanwhile, the criminal underworld has grown tense, as conflicts between the Black Sun, Hutt Cartel and The Exchange have laid the seeds for war between the Galaxy's great crime syndicates. The Mandalorians, fresh off of reclaiming worlds lost to the Republic in a failed crusade a half-century prior, have called for a hunt on Force adepts throughout the Galaxy.\n\nHowever, all the Galactic players' plans were put on hold about half a year ago, when we launched Violet Stars Beckon, our first sitewide event since our reboot. The Archeri Chorus, a Force-sensitive hivemind, launched a devastating conquest of Hutt Space with the Singing Spire - a superweapon with which the Chorus forcibly subdued entire planets at once - at its head. One world after another fell before the Archeri onslaught as they cut a path through Hutt Space, conquered Nal Hutta itself, slaughtered all but one of the Hutt Grand Council, and laid terrible siege to Nar Shaddaa. While the Smuggler's Moon burned, with billions falling ill with the deadly Archeri Plague, the Chorus began construction a second spire, with which they planned to launch an all-out assault on the Galaxy at large.\n\nThe Galactic Republic and Sith Empire, spurred to action by the new threat, reached an unprecedented agreement to ally against the Archeri and deployed the full weight of their power to Nar Shaddaa. While they were ultimately successful in defeating the Chorus, victory left little time for celebration. A Republic battlegroup, acting on its own, opened fire on and destroyed several Sith vessels as the battle concluded. Now, with the mutual threat diminished and Hutt Space in ruins, the Galaxy careens ever closer to the cold war between the two superpowers turning hot...",

I suppose I'm a sucker for the baddies, but think the stormtroopers need their full due. They were my favorites from the first film and the only ones I will ever know. \n\nAnyway, I had an idea to have Vader interact with them and I was thinking he would fight alongside them in a battle, maybe on the Tantive IV? And we could witness their interaction and how he commands them and leads them? \n\nI think also, there is potential for a story idea where we can see them on the Death Star before and during the events of a New Hope?\n\nI\u2019m looking for mature people at least 18 or older and willing to help me out with this.",

            "selftext": "Hey there :), \n\n23 year old female in search of long term roleplay partners, male only. \n\nI do have a few roleplay ideas however I certainly am open to hearing yours if you have them. If we can\u2019t agree on one we can definitely write one up together. \n\nI like drama, action, romance, day to day life, forbidden romance and could even dabble in the fantasy category. I\u2019m not hard to please but I do have a few notes worth reading so neither of our time will be wasted.  \n\nAs follows; \n\n-I don\u2019t mind sex scenes in roleplay but just don\u2019t make it all about sex. \n\n-partners must be minimum 18+ but preferably 20+\n\n-proper grammar and literacy is important.\n\n-it\u2019s always hard to find people who can give the same amount of effort and details as I do. I\u2019m not saying you have to match word for word but at least try to give the same amount of detail it\u2019s not that hard. \n\n-I understand life goes on outside of the roleplay universe I get busy as well so if you need to be absent for a few hours or more just let me know I\u2019ll be more than patient. \n\n-if the roleplay isn\u2019t going the way you like JUST SAY SO. Don\u2019t ghost. I\u2019ll do my best to fix what you don\u2019t like and get us both on track.  \n\nWe can roleplay via Kik, discord or here, I\u2019m okay with any of those options so whatever you prefer we will do. Message me if interested and we\u2019ll work it all out. \n\nSee you in my DM\u2019s :) \nXo Riley",

            "selftext": " \n\nHello :) I am searching for a role play partner that would be interested in specifically romance type roles. Example roles would include; TeacherXStudent, BossXSecretary, etc. whatever it is you're in the mood for. Or it could include fantasy roles as well, I'm not picky honestly and will do just about any kind of role. Just to be clear, certain roles, like TeacherXStudent to name one, will not be an \"ageplay\" type of role play. Not to sound rude, but if you request an ageplay type role play I will not respond.\n\nYou Do Not have to be the most literate person as long as you're not sending short 5 word messages. 1-2 sentences would be fine with me as long as you are descriptive enough to move the story forward.\n\nNow, these roles plays can and more than likely will contain NSFW type material so Please be at least 18+. I would prefer to message over kik or discord, but if you do not have one or you just don't like to use kik or discord, then just let me know and we can work something out.\n\nIf you have any other questions about something I wasn't too specific on and/or you are interested in being my partner please message me. I look forward to hearing from you :)",

I\u2019ve been having a hard time finding a decent partner to rp with. Just please while you take the time to read this give me to show you I can be a good partner. I have a couple of good plots I would like to try out if anyone is interested. If you have a plot that you would wanna try out I am open to that. I believe that when rping is something two people should be able to enjoy together so I\u2019m open to a lot of stuff. I wanted to combine genre of cyberpunk but give it a small twist to it. I have a few plot ideas I would like to mess with. \n\nThis is something different from the game Itself. This takes place in a Neo Tokyo  was thinking about a drug which would boost a person's rage; a kind of \"berserk drug\". The drug would make people feel great and invincible- increasing their violent tendencies. This would spread like wildfire in society, my character who is merc who was once with the syndicate but cut his ties with them.He now takes odd jobs around neo Tokyo while bounty hunting. (Your character) would be what oracle is to batman. Being able to scan areas for him and helping him get through certain. Obstacles with hacking. As for the plot I wanted to base it on the everyday life of bounty hunting and taking jobs from crime bosses and stuff of that caliber. I also wanna create lore around this story and focus on character back stories and stuff like that: if you are interested please dm me.\n\nWARNING: if you do choose to dm me and want to partake in this rp please be serious and committed to it. I\u2019m starting to get tired of people wanting to do this rp then disappear and ghost me... I need a serious partner that is willing to expand this rp and enjoy writing a story for it.",

You put it on and quickly realize its possibilities for both good and evil. Your character could be sadistic and selfish, or heroic and wacky, if a little mischievous.\n\nMe? I'm just along for the ride. If you're not entirely familiar with the canon but are still interested, just let me know and I can answer your questions. It would be ideal if you could play multiple characters, but if not It doesn't really matter.

You could even become famous! Hunters have these special abilities called \u201cHunter Instinct\u201d, and every hunters hunter instinct is unique! Hunter instinct can range from manipulating earth with your mind, or even manipulate minds! Hunters often use weapons to accompany their hunter instinct.\n\n\nHello!

Taking in the sight of his wrists tied to the wooden posts of the bed. His legs sprawled out like he was a turkey that was about to be stuffed.\n\nEventually it became too much for him. He couldn\u2019t hold it back anymore. It first started with a twitch of his lips. Then moving on to a tear dropping from his eye. Until it felt like his stomach was about to split apart. That is when he couldn\u2019t hold it back anymore. \n\n\u201cOh my god, y-you can\u2019t be serious!\u201d\n\nThe tears started flowing freely and he began to laugh even more. The pain inside of his stretched body growing from him not being able to curl up from the laughter.\n\n\u201cyou\u2019re here to k-kill me?\u201d\n\nAt this point he seemed like a complete fool. Naked and giggling to such an extent that he couldn\u2019t be heard correctly. Taking in a few short bursts of oxygen he calmed back down and then stared at the figure in front of him. Starting to try to reach behind the bed post where his knife lay hidden he began to talk some more. \n\n\u201csure, I mean vampires are supposed to be the most elite of assassins; but come on. You\u2019re nothing more than what appears to be a corner gal in all black.\u201d\n\nTouching the end of the hilt he flicked his finger up and the blade he had hidden shot up. Doing a flip or two mid air it came down and cut open the binding on his wrists.\n\n\u201cthere we go...\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nHey everyone! It\u2019s been quite a while since I\u2019ve been here. However I have an idea I\u2019ve been wanting to do for quite some time. I want my character to be a normal human who has... well, let\u2019s say not made very many friends. \n\nSo! Where will this story take place? Maybe in medieval times ? Shall we go along brandishing swords and fighting side by side ? Maybe we will be in present time, I\u2019m always down for a fun fight scene.\n\nI have been writing for about a decade now. I really do not mind how long you have been writing as long as you can send in-depth and at the least a paragraph or two response. I\u2019m not a huge stickler for correct grammar... as you can tell I probably made quite a few mistakes here and there. The only think I ask is you know the very basics ( such as your and you\u2019re ).\n\nHope to hear from you soon! (:",

            "selftext": "&gt;**Sublevel Studio in Downtown Los Angeles - November 28th, Excerpt from Nightly Casualties (Narration by Grompit)**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*The Hallway is dark.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Not something that would bother a Lasombra. The stone walls are bland and imposing. A chill hangs in the air, or perhaps simply the memory of cold. She was dead after all.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*A rhythmic, pulsing beat carried through the hall, coming from everywhere and nowhere. The way ahead lead into darkness - human eyes only work so well in the dark.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*The way behind is the empty, hungry darkness Eleanor was intimately familiar with. There would be no beat in it.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*The notion of that rhythmic beat being consumed sent ghost fingers running up Eleanor\u2019s spine.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*The way ahead was dark. But not as dark as behind.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*The hall stretched and turned. No end in sight. Only the darkness before her and the hunger behind her.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*No doors on either side of the hall, just rough hewn stone. The chill, bone deep, loosened its claws the more she walked.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*The sound of her footsteps drowned out by the rhythmic, all consuming beat. It echoed in her ears and rattled her teeth, yet was balm to her heart and stitches to a ragged soul.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*The beat is everything.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*The beat is nothing.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Everywhere and when.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*It knows all and none.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Life untamed and unbridled.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*As she walked, though. The beat softened, shrinking down. It no longer rattled her teeth or shook her bones. Instead it was the true north of her compass, guiding her forward.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*A door brings her hallway to an end. Plain, oak planks bound together by iron strips. A simple, unpolished handle.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Something tells her it isn\u2019t locked. All she had to do was open it.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*The heartbeat lay beyond, and the Hunger behind her.*\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in reading the rest of Eleanor\u2019s nightmare, or get in on some scenes yourself, LA in Anarchy is the place to be!\n\nLA in Anarchy is a Vampire: the Masquerade play-by-post/text roleplaying server which uses 4th or 20th Anniversary Edition rules.\n\nWe\u2019re an active community of writers and roleplayers searching for others who wish to narratively explore the various themes present in Vampire in a moderated Sandbox environment.

            "selftext": "It was October 1978... a man named Michael Myers returned to him childhood hometown of Haddonfield. It was there he killed 5, he was only stopped by one Dr Samuel Loomis. Loomis managed to halt the spree of Myers with 6 shots, saving who would of been his next target, Laurie Strode. Michael dissapeared from the location before police arrived but the night of carnage did not end there. \n\nStrode was taken to a hospital where Myers followed. It was there the final showdown occurred. In an effort to kill Myers, both Strode and Loomis filled the room with a flammable chemical. Loomis then had Strode exit. It was then Loomis ignited the compound. Sending himself and Myers into flames. Strode recounted to the police watching a now blind and on fire Myers limping out of the room before finally collapsing dead. \n\nHaddonfield banned the holiday known as Halloween from being celebrated for years, the fear of another Myers like incident coming to life spread through the town causing such a decision. But that was 35 years ago. It is now 2013, Haddonfields newest generation has all but forgotten the events of that night. But you? You wish to uncover them, document and create a story out of them. \n\nAnd who are you? 20 year old Cora Adeline. A film manor and part time writer. You've recently moved to Haddonfeild from Colorado as you were accepted into its prestigious college. Once there you learned of the events from an old film teacher who remembered the night in great detail. It was then you were hooked on the story, you wanted to know more. For your next film project you decide to do a documentary of that night. Including an interview with none other than Laurie Strode. Although she hasnt exactly been returning your calls. \n\nOtherwise school has been great, not only are you a straight A student. But you're quite popular among your fellow film fanatics. However the school isnt all sunshine and rainbows among each student... there is one kid. Nathan Castle, a quiet offen overlooked kid who keeps to himself and tends to stay away from people if he can. Hes not one youd wish to partner up with if you can help up. Not that hes done anything bad, most just get a bad vibe from him. But that doesnt concern you, you have more important task to focus on. But, soon that focus will be turned to something much more.... dangerous. \n\nHello! I hope my prompt got your interest, basically this is an AU of the Halloween universe in which 1 and 2 are the only to canonically take place. While Michael Myers is dead the shape that possessed him still lives in. This rp would play through its next possession in the form of Nathan Castle. Much of this story will be formed as we go and as always I'd love to hear your ideas!  Thank you!",

            "selftext": "(It's very important to me that anyone interested read everything before messaging me. I can tell when someone doesn\u2019t read what I\u2019m about to say. Thanks!)\n\n**About Me**\n\nAnyway! Hi, I'm Aterose and currently looking for a long term roleplay partner, though that much is obvious. I\u2019m a nineteen-year-old (twenty next month for those who care about age) female living in the EST timezone. I have about 8-9 years of writing experience and consider myself pretty literate.\n\n**What I\u2019m Searching For**\n\n* Literacy. I prefer to roleplay with someone who can write at least two to three paragraphs minimum. The two of us should be going well over Discord's 2000 character limit.\n* Willing to chat OOC. I find it important to have a friendship with my partners as well as discussing future plots for our roleplay.\n* Must play both male and female characters.\n* Third-person only \n* Romance. Our roleplay won't revolve around romance but more so our plot. If our characters are hitting it off though I'm all for it.\n* Patience. I work 4-5 days a week so don\u2019t ask me when I\u2019m going to reply next, I can\u2019t stress this enough. \n* Finally I require you to not reply every day. An odd request but if I have a partner replying hours after my own reply I feel obligated to respond. As stated before I have a busy life. Please wait at least 24 hours before responding.\n\n**What I Will Not Do** \n\n* Smut (I prefer to fade to black)\n* Modern\n* Historic\n* Canon characters (From you or me) \n* Fandoms. Unless I have seen/read/played the fandom and the plot is good enough. This is a big maybe though. Roleplays inspired by fandoms is fine. \n\n**What I\u2019m Interested In**\n\n* Near future settings such as futuristic concepts in a semi-modern time. If you\u2019ve ever read Neal Shusterman you\u2019ll know what I\u2019m talking about. \n* Future settings but humanity has taken a step backward. Horizon Zero Dawn is a great example of this. \n* Sandbox! I\u2019m all for sandbox. It leaves a ton of room to do whatever we want. I almost always do dystopian future settings and possibly some fantasy thrown in there.\n* One idea I have is not very detailed but we can figure it out along the way. The government has fallen due to a force we can discuss. There was chaos, death, and destruction. A large town/small city decided to come together and form their own government, only they couldn't come to an agreement as well so they split the city in half. Our characters are on opposite sides. We can decide what their goal is, whether that be putting an end to the dispute or something else. \n* Not so much a plot but a preference. I find my most successful roleplays are those that start as a basic concept. This can be for example, \u201cMy character is a bandit, yours is a bounty hunter\u201d or \u201cYour character is a knight and mine a princess\u201d and we just start from there. It leaves a lot of room to just go wherever we want instead of creating a set plot that we have to follow. So if you have a concept you\u2019re itching to try don\u2019t be afraid to bring it up! Seven times out of ten I\u2019ll be interested. \n* Other than that I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m interested in right now, I\u2019ve been branching out due to partners having some pretty amazing ideas so I guess I\u2019ll just continue with that. Just throw whatever ideas you got at me and we can figure something out! Please suggest at least one idea when messaging me. \n\nIf you're interested or just have questions shoot me a message with your ideas and a little bit of information about yourself. I will not respond to chat requests or \"Still looking?\". Please DM only. Also, if you've read everything add your favorite color to your message. Hope to hear from you soon!",

            "selftext": "Hi all, \n\nA little bit about me: I\u2019m a 19 year old girl from the great US of A, and have been roleplaying for about five years now on and off. Some of my hobbies include but are certainly not limited to reading (sci-fi and horror), baking (if you don't message me regarding roleplaying, do it for the carrot cake recipe... you won't regret it!), working out (and convincing myself that sitting in the jacuzzi at LA Fitness is part of the workout...), going out with friends, and writing! All kinds of writing from fiction to essays, journaling to poetry... I'd also love to read your writing! I work as a college writing tutor part-time while attending school, and being able to read student narratives always makes my day. \n\n Lately I\u2019ve wanted to get back into the swing of things, and figured we could create a slice of life roleplay together! I'm hoping for a plot where our character development can flourish. On top of that my roles always involve romance, drama, twists and turns. That\u2019s the beauty of writing with a partner, there are surprises around every corner! \n\nI\u2019m hoping for a man who can match my age or be older (please not above 30 or so, just a personal comfort thing), someone who is literate and can hand me a paragraph or two for each response, and writes in first person. I\u2019m timely and like to get back to my partners each day, multiple times a day when things are going well. Sometimes, though, life gets in the way! I understand, and just want someone who can communicate with me. This will take place either on Discord or via email! \n\nAdditionally, I would love to be able to chat out of character together. It creates such a warm and friendly bond that can only enhance roles. Would absolutely love to brainstorm together, and someone who can contribute ideas is much appreciated. \n\nSome potential roles to work with or think about:\n\n* Enemies or two who don\u2019t particularly get along, maybe they\u2019re within the same apartment complex or friend group and are forced to interact (I love a little bit of conflict to get the ball rolling)\n* A teacher/student relationship (I love a good taboo)\n* Feuding families (A modern day R&amp;J deal) or rival colleges \n* A rich house owner and live in maid\n* Exes? Spicy, we can chat more about the potential circumstances. \n\nThe list goes on and on, and I\u2019d love to know  what intrigues you outside of this list as well. Hope to hear from you soon!",

As the title says I'm looking for a long-term roleplay partner for a fantasy or sci-fi plot.\n\n* I'd like that you can write more than 4-5 sentences at a time with good spelling.\n* Let me know if you'll be disappearing for a long time.\n* Open in communication so we are having as much fun as possible.\n* Not afraid of adult content, but isn't looking for exclusively such.\n\nMy preferred platform is Discord, though I'd be open to others if you ask first.\n\nWith all that business out of the way, here's a little about me. I'm an advanced roleplayer who loves fantasy and sci-fi. When I say fantasy, I usually mean your mediaeval fair with more complicated settings instead of typical kingdoms and such. On the other hand, when I say sci-fi I mean far future/space-age type settings the modern era just gets overdone. I'm also a big fan of adult content in my stories, but I don't want them to be the sole focus of the roleplay.\n\nIf you have any more questions for me, don't be afraid to ask. My DMs are always open and I'll make sure to answer within a day. To make sure you read this far, tell me your favourite book/movie. I can't wait for your response!",

            "selftext": "I am 18+ and all participants of this roleplay are 18+\n\nHello, hello! I am looking for a long term roleplay set in the My Hero Academia universe! I have a small plot already set in motion however if you don't like the idea, we can easily change it. \n\nI would rather discuss the plot I have planned as it breaks the community guidelines. \n\nThe character that I have is named Kessho Daiya, her Quirk allows her to create crystals from her body and the ground, the ones from her body cannot be longer than 2.5 feet, wider than 5 inches, or thicker than 5 inches. The ones from her body are rough, and a bit ugly looking. The ones she creates from the ground are much more refined and beautiful. There are materials she cannot grow through, like wood and tile, but the rest are mostly fair game. As a result of her limitations on what she can create, she has specialized in combat with a shortsword and a buckler shield. She has taken the name Crystal Fox for her superhero name, as her mother was a fox-themed hero, and her father could create gems from the ground, but not like Kessho can. She is a third year in UA, and she does her Work Study with the Pro Hero Native. \n\nIf you're intrested, message me. All comments on this post will be ignored.",

            "selftext": "I was 17 when I saw you. \n\nI remember seeing you from place to place and had labelled you to be a rough around the edges man who hadn't seemed to grow out of a boyish grin. I'd seen you several times either drinking alone on a hot day, dragging on a cigarette when you thought no one was looking and sometimes in my free time I'd get distracted watching you work on something.   \nFrom my bedroom window I could look up and down the street for quite some distance, including up to the porch of your house.    \nMost nights I could hear yelling from your direction, sometimes your voice, sometimes others'. There were even occasions where other neighbours had alerted the police just in case something was wrong. Things always quietened down pretty fast when that was the case.  \n\n\nYou were perhaps 20 or so at the time, but what I could never figure out is why, if your family caused you as much trouble as they did, why you didn't just up and leave already. I gave you a lot of my sympathies, though you didn't know it. I figured maybe it was true that trauma, both past or present, could sometimes tie you down.   \n\n\nI was 17 and a half when I finally spoke to you.  \n\n\n\"Invite some friends\". That was what my parents had said when I complained about not wanting them to host a get-together at our house. Those things were always full of children that were too young for me to talk to, or adults too old to want to talk to me. \n\nAfter a day of contemplating it, I walked down the stretch of road until I reached your front door. I nervously tucked stray strands of hair behind my ears before knocking. In the few seconds that passed, I considered turning around numerous times, though my feet remained planted where they were. When you answered the door, I realised I wasn't very prepared and stumbled all over my words to begin with. The sharp smell of cigarettes did snap me back into reality though. \n\n  \n\"There's like a... Thing going on at my place tonight. Parents are just throwing some sort of friendly catch up, nothing exciting, just... I don't know, we're practically neighbours and still we've never really spoken.\" I remember trying a smile. \n\nThat night, you brought more alcohol than either of us could finish. We stayed in my room keeping out of the way, but you got me smashed and yourself tipsy. I ended up tripping over something and that caught my parents' attention. They (very) promptly saw what had happened and sent you out. Naturally, I don't remember too much from that night, but I do remember that when they sternly told you to leave, you picked up the unfinished bottle in one hand, raising both arms as if innocent, and walked out without an issue. You were cool about it, unapologetic.   \nAfter that, I wasn't really allowed to see you.   \n\n\nI was 18 when I ceased caring.\n\nBy then, there wasn't much my parents could do to stop me. I used my study time to visit you. You had bought a piece of crap car that had become your most prized possession and in that thing we'd go on drives without destinations in the middle of the night. We snuck into some field one time and sat in the tall grass. As it happens, that was where you kissed me. You were assuring me the whole time that everything was fine, and for a while I forgot about the itchiness of the ground and the rock that was pressing into my shoulder as you hovered over me. I believed you.  \nBut then the middle aged owner of the property must have seen us and shooed us off, cursing \"stupid kids\", likely because of some of his own insecurities. On the drive back, you talked to me about just how exciting it would be to run away, how if I wanted to, you'd take care of it.   \n\n\nIt was the day before my 19th birthday when I took you up on that offer.  \n\n\nThey say it only took one more straw to break the camel's back, but it was an anvil that broke mine. When my rejection letters for college returned to the house, it was enough to send me to my room, packing my bags full of anything I thought to be sentimentally, practically or financially valuable. I dragged it all to your front door step and again, knocked, and for the second time, I was unprepared. Your mother answered the door.   \n\n\n\"Is he home?\"\n\n\"Are you pregnant?\"\n\n\"I said, is he home?\"\n\nYou appeared a few moments later and I think when you saw the bags you knew what I was there for. We left, off to a gas station for our first stop. You picked up a map and a couple bottles of water and tossed me a chocolate bar, a look on your face that told me you knew I could do with it.  \n\n\nI'm still 19. We've been on the road for a while now and I've noticed that sometimes you snap. Things frustrate you easily and though it's my instinct to try and fix it, sometimes it's clear that all you want is space. Take for instance, now: We checked in to a shitty motel and there's a pretty considerable space between you and I. From here, I had a lonely view of your back.  \n\n\n&gt;\\*So yeah, this is either a roleplay prompt if you want, or just a sampler to see if you think we might be able to come up with something new. For a bit of a head start, I like historical pieces. Westerns, world wars, all the old school stuff. I like characters who are opposites and have some (or a lot) conflict. I like adventures, I like details, I like the correct use of punctuation.\\*  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\*Looking forward to seeing some of you round\\*",

            "selftext": "Hiya! As my title suggests I\u2019m seeking partners for an adventure plot, however I\u2019ve been thinking about and craving a twist on the standard roleplay formula that could really shake things up and take us down an interesting route! I\u2019d like to write a plot whereby our characters are plagued with a curse, which every so often gives them a random active effect! I imagine the effects would range from the inconvenient, to the down-right detrimental - it is a curse after all - and we could certainly get creative with how NSFW we wanted to gear them! \n \nA little about myself as well, as what I\u2019m looking for. I\u2019m a 22 year old Female from the UK. I write exclusively in third person, past tense, multi-paragraph/novella format, this is non-negotiable and I would require my partner to share my writing style! Most of my writing happens in the evenings and night time of GMT due to my job, but I\u2019m more than happy to post more frequently when I\u2019m able to on days off! I\u2019m someone who tends to have ideas coming out of my ears when I get to world building and plotting with a partner, I\u2019d love for anybody interested to be someone who can bounce ideas with me, or at least take kindly to my constant stream of thoughts! As for what I\u2019m looking for in a partner specifically: I\u2019m looking for someone who is happy to world build and plot with me before we get started, while I have a concept for a plot I don\u2019t have anything towards the likes of a fully-fleshed world! Making a friend OOC is also delightful, writing together works best when we enjoy talking as well! Lastly, I\u2019d like for my partner to be open to a fair amount of NSFW content, this plot is something that could get very dark, crazy, and weird, I\u2019d very much get on better with a partner who would enjoy that - needless to say, partners over 18 only please! \n \nThank you for taking the time to read my post! \nI\u2019d love to hear from any fellow funky gals interested in my idea! Shoot me a private message and we can get to plotting on discord! \nI look forward to hearing from you!\n \n~ Boobbie x",

I\u2019m certainly over 21 and I prefer my partners to be as well.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what the current term is, but I\u2019m looking for someone who writes well. Advanced? Literate? Whatever. Please have a good grasp on the English language, complete with varied sentence structure, correct spelling, appropriate punctuation, and all that jazz. After all, you have to know the rules in order to break them in ways that are fun! For the most part, I write multiple paragraphs and would love to find someone who does the same.\n\nI like chatting with my partners about our lives and getting to know each other. I honestly don\u2019t care about your gender, but if it matters to you, I\u2019m a guy.\n\nMy current job has me working odd hours, so while technically my timezone is EST, I\u2019m on mostly at night. This will be changing soon, so I'll keep you updated.\n\nSound good? Drop me a PM and we can discuss specifics. I have a pile of plot bunnies scampering around in my head that I am happy to share. Also, if you\u2019d like a writing sample, I\u2019m happy to oblige. My PMs are always open if you have questions.\n\n\u2014 V",

I miss the outlet and creativity it always gives me, so I\u2019m back on the search! \n\nI\u2019m intrigued by several eras of history. \nI feel most comfortable set in America, but anything from the revolutionary war up to the 1920s...\n\nI play female characters, can play multiple characters at a time or just one... I\u2019m 25, and prefer 21+ for my partners. It just feels comfier. \n\nI\u2019m interested in day-to-day life. A slow burn relationship. Friendship. Romance. I am open to many different ideas. \n\nAs far as plot, I like it to be fairly dramatic. I like putting my characters through the ringer - throwing life\u2019s challenges their way. I find the historical context also helps add in other drama from societal norms and other things (diseases, lack of medicine, etc). \n\nI\u2019m really interested in creating the plot together with my partner. I find we are both more invested that way, and it is such a fun part of the roleplaying experience for me. \n\nIf any of this catches your eye,\nSend me a message! I look forward to hearing from you.",

The roleplay i'm imagining won't focus on smut, as i would rather focus on violence. It will be based around the mafia world, i will play a vigilante who is seeking justice for what the mafia did to her family. And you will play a Godfather, who recently discovered your right hand man is gone. \n\nThis is my first time posting on here, so i can be flexible around the plot but the roles will remain the same.

So first about me:\n-I'm female, 20 years old\n-I write exclusively in 1st person, present tense\n-I'm in PST and I do have a day job so bare that in mind please. \n\nAnyways, onto the good stuff! :)\n\nI'm looking for a partner doesnt matter if your gender irl as long as you play male since I can only play female. I only have a few requirements:\n\n-Be 18+\n-Be response in rp\n-Be transparent out of rp \n-Be open to most things \n\nSo, my RPS wildly vary but then tend to center around romance. I enjoy smut though it's not the main focus of my rps. I have many in mind but currently I'm craving a Sci-Fi destiny based rp (dont worry you dont have to know a lot, its just loosely based) Feel free to message me and I'll get to you when I can! I'm very friendly so if you read so far please send Bannanas somewhere in your initial message to me :) Also, let me know what you're interested in and be nice! My top rp takes priority but I'm into everything! I hope to hear from you soon!",

            "selftext": "[F4M] In a galaxy far, far away...\n\nWelcome to this search post. \n\nLet me tell you a little about myself first. I am a female, a writer since I could think of stories and write them down and a passionate Roleplayer. I have a had a pretty inactive phase, but decided to make a new account to restart completely. \nSo, if we exchange discord names and we have chatted before, but stopped the rp, pls, don\u2019t think I will stop again! I have had personal problems, but now it should all be alright again, so feel free to suggest us to restart our previous rp or do a new one.\n\nBut what am I looking for now? I am a literate writer and can write everything from one paragraph to multiple or even novella. I highly prefer a faster pace though, so I\u2019d stick to two to three paragraphs. If you write less, it\u2019s all good too. Just no one liners! \n\nLet\u2019s get to the story part of things. I am very in the mood to rp as one of my OCs and I am open to play against other OCs. We can do every era, even tho I don\u2019t know everything about every era. I have watched all movies, vaguely remember clone wars and didn\u2019t play all games, but definitely looked up lots of story parts and will also do that for the rp if needed. \n\nI have no particular story lines in mind, but would love to explore a romance between Jedi on the run and a Sith or Bounty Hunter.\n\n1) Jedi on the run and a Sith: between Order 66 and a New Hope, probably Sith being sent to hunt down the Jedi\n2) Jedi on the run and bounty hunter: almost the same\n3) Rebel and a person working for the empire (General, Sith, whatever): Rebel would probably get imprisoned and how they\u2019d get out of it? \n\nIf you want to do canon x canon, I can play Rey and Leia. I do ship Reylo and Hanleia, but in general, I am aiming more for oc x oc.\n\nOC x canon is okay too, if we go for doubling. No OC x canon without doubling!\n\nFeel free to message me!!",
