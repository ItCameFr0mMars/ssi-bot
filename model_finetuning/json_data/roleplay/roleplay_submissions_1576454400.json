Thanks. I want someone who is willing to put the time and effort into this role and be serious about it. I\u2019m going to do my best as being Gal Gadot\u2019s WW, with some added flavor.\n\nI think this could be an excellent project. Please send me a PM, and hopefully we can get a Google Doc on it. I want this to be a great role-play and story. Both Batman and Wonder Woman deserve a story focusing on the both of them. Diana is always so positive and upbeat, and Bruce is so dark and brooding. It\u2019ll be interesting to see them interact.\n\nI hope I have some takers. This is something I want to have fun with.\n\nA descriptive player is preferred, and someone who is over the age of 18.",

School and reluctance are unwelcome bedfellows.)\n\nBut anyway, the new topic is a rather different one; \"My Life as a Teenage Robot\", that cartoon from Rob Renzetti that aired on Nickelodeon years ago. Well, this plot was set in it, myself assuming the roles of characters when needed (though mostly keeping to Sheldon), while my partner is mostly intended to play Jenny (though, it's up for discussion, should my partner wish to also play other characters).\n\nEssentially, in this roleplay, Sheldon's matured considerably from when we last saw him. He's shed a few of his habits, especially almost all of his bad ones, and really hunkered down on his studies. He's most comparable to a young Tony Stark, sans the ego. What brought about this change? Well, I wouldn't want to spoil the surprise.\n\nHowever, just when life seems to be going his way, there always seems to be something or someone out to put a pin in it. Be it the Cluster, Armageddroid, or new villains. It's whatever, though, Jenny's always got it covered.\n\nAt least, that's what Sheldon likes to tell himself.\n\nRequirements:\n\n- I'm looking for a partner (preferably female. I don't feel comfortable doing 1x1, otherwise.) of at least 17 years of age.\n\n- Quality over quantity writing. I don't expect a thesaurus.\n\n- Transparent understanding of the setting and characters in aforementioned setting.\n\n- NSFW is certainly NOT a topic of discussion. I will not entertain suggestions of it.\n\n- If you meet the requirements above, message me (no chat invites, please).\n\n\nOtherwise, farewell, roleplayers, and have a good night!",

            "selftext": "My name is Hidatsu, but you can call me whatever. I'm 27 and a stay at home mom. I have a toddler thats 2 1/2, which means i'm constantly stepping in and out of the chat. I also have a husband thats a pain sometimes, and I might step away for that. But other than that, I'm usually online most of the day, either on the laptop or on my phone. \n\nEven on my phone, I still tend to write anywhere from 300-500 word posts on average, occasionally writing a 2K word post (If I'm in the flow of a scene; sometimes I get carried away.) I write as the character tells me as they're the ones in control; i'm just here to write it down. I'm hoping to find someone whos just as passionate about writing their own characters, and who can enjoy the story we write together. \n\nI also get very involved with the stories I write. My characters are just as big of a part as yours, and I love delving into their stories. I get super attached and when I'm inspired, I feel im annoying because I tend to bounce around a lot. I have ADHD so I can't really stick to one thing for long, except for writing. I'm bad about spamming things when I feel inspired, be that art/manips that I made, pictures of their faceclaim (i'm really bad with the twins), musics (both song links and playlists for  Spotify, and youtube links), and small little IC blurbs from the boys themselves! \n\nI only play male OCs that I already have made. My content rating is R, and I\u2019m only interested in writing with those that are 18+. I have like 3 original characters that have my muse right now,  and lately Remus has been rather loud and demanding of attention. I also can make new characters if it suits the story. You say \u2018but Hida, I don't double.\u2019 Would you be opposed to, say, having me run two characters? I have idential twins that I hope you meet later, and the storylines that I use them for contains the two of them together. \n\nA note, before we delve into what interested me. I'm in the search of not just a writing partner but a new friend as well. I'll be around just as much in ooc as I am for ic stuff, probably more. I'm not trying to scare you off or anything, just letting you know that I'm not going to up and leave. And if I have before, I am sorry. It won\u2019t happen again. \n\nRight, on to the content stuff!\n\nOkay so I\u2019m really interested in:\n\n* small towns and supernatural happenings (with wolf shapeshifters, demons, )\n* post apocalyptic/dystopia (zombies anyone?)\n* supernatural/modern fantasy (werewolves, shapeshifters, monster x hunter)\n* emotionally charged/dark and gritty\n* unresolved sexual tension/slow burn\n* redemption\n* luring to the other side\n\nAs for pairings, these all looked very tempting.\n\n* enemies to lovers\n* friends turned lovers/pining\n* Grumpy (mine)  x sunshine (yours)\n* the broken man (mine) x the woman that becomes his light (yours)\n* dark hearted man (mine) melting for the innocent woman/man (yours) \n* friend x best friend\u2019s older sibling\n* hurt/comfort (most often physical hurt, so be okay with gore)\n* Lady (yours) and the tramp (mine) esque/class difference\n* Biker (mine) x civilian (yours)\n* soul mates (I have an idea or two for this option)\n* blind date\n* experienced x inexperienced\n* injured/scarred warrior washed out from their former glory (mine) x royal/heir-to-be (yours) - this one can be used in a mideival or modern times, depending on who I play.\n\nI know, what a long list! But I mean, all of those sound absolutely fantastic to me. And I\u2019m crap at making decisions. SO. I guess its up to us to figure out which one to do. I\u2019m open to doing more than one storyline at once if you are, or we could just do one at a time. Whatever you want to do is cool with me. I\u2019m a sucker for romance, but also know that it has to develop organically for me via IC writing. Its one of my favorite genres to write, along with violence and the aftermath. I really enjoy writing my masculine males as injured and force them to rely on someone else. They\u2019re also usually pretty dark, dominant, violent and aggressive. But all of them are big softies the longer you write with them. One of my favorite things to write are werewolves, so you might hear me nudge towards that a little on my end. \n\nI hope this didn\u2019t scare you off, and that you\u2019d be interested in writing with me. &lt;3",

            "selftext": "\n\nHey everybody! It\u2019s winter break for me so I have a lot of free time on my hands.I\u2019m looking for a long term partner for a romance RP. I have quite a few different ideas and roles! Since it is a romantic story nsfw elements will probably be present but they are there to help advance the story of the characters relationship. A detailed story would be the best but not every response has to be a couple paragraphs, sometimes just a few lines or sentences are enough! \n\nHere\u2019s a few ideas/roles of mine, if there\u2019s one you like we can discuss it in more detail or if you have an idea please let me know! I keep the ideas pretty open ended so we can build them up together.\n\n1.Slice of Life:\n   Best friends younger sibling,\n   Senior year high school\n   Christmas party \n   Coworkers\n\n2.Fantasy: \n   Game of thrones (OC houses and characters or a game of thrones like world),\n   Harry Potter (OC characters or a world similar)\n \n3.Historical:\n    Ancient Rome/Greece,\n    Medieval,\n    Renaissance,\n    Wild West,\n     1920\u2019s \n\n4.Post Apocalyptic:\n    The 100 show (situation similar)\n\nSome of these ideas can be combined also! Like I said I keep them pretty open ended so we can make a story we both enjoy. You can make your character however you like! I prefer to write in 3rd person. I\u2019m also only comfortable with RPing with 18+ given that there may be nsfw elements to it. I think that is it so just pm your discord and we can discuss ideas and go from there!",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone! I\u2019m Kiri, and I\u2019m looking for people to write stories with!\n\nWriting is one of my biggest loves! Crafting stories, building worlds, and most importantly, collaborating on wonderful, dramatic relationships between characters is a fulfilling joy of mine. I get very involved in roleplays, to the point where, if I see that my writing partner has responded, it truly makes me day.\n\nA little about me: I only roleplay in original settings - and as long as the genre has a hint of fantasy in it, I\u2019m game! Fantasy, sci-fi, horror, you name it, I\u2019m there! I love roleplays with F/F and M/M pairings the most, but I still dig a F/M pairings too. I play all genders, all sorts of characters - anything\u2019s fair game for me. I prefer to roleplay on either Google Docs or Discord.\n\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019m looking for in a writing partner:\n\n* **Someone at least 21+.** I\u2019m 26, I like to write with people close to my age.\n* **Someone who identifies as female.** This is just because I get along best with women and female-identifying folk. Sorry, this is just a preference! **While I prefer to write with women, I write all genders, and you can play whatever gender is your preference!** I honestly love all pairings, really!\n* **Someone who is excited about collaborating on the story together!** I have a lot of ideas, but I want to hear yours as well! Let\u2019s work together to create a story that will keep us captivated and daydreaming about the world we\u2019ve built!\n* **Someone who understands that real life does come first.** I can\u2019t respond to our roleplay every day - between work and my health, not every day is a good day to write, for me. I highly value quality over frequency - sometimes I\u2019ve thought about wonderful response that my partner has written for days, before I\u2019m ready to meet my keyboard. My biggest pet peeve is being pestered for posts. A patient partner is definitely a must for me.\n* **A friend!** My best writing partners have grown into my friends - and some of my best friends are my writing partners! I don\u2019t want to only message folks strictly about the roleplay. Naturally, I\u2019d want to get to know ya too! I\u2019m a very bubbly and open person, so it saddens me when people only want to talk about the roleplay. Sometimes talking about a random thing can lead to a story idea! All in all, I write best with friendly storytellers.\n\nHere's some ideas I have cooking up\u2026 I shortened them greatly for this post; if any interest you, please let me know and I can tell you the ideas I had behind them!\n\nAnd if you have an ideas \u2013 whether it\u2019s about my ideas, or original ideas you had, I want to hear about them! Don\u2019t be shy, I\u2019d love to help ya develop your roleplay ideas too!\n\nAlso, one other note \u2013 I haven\u2019t mentioned genders in these plot descriptions because I love playing any gender, and whatever gender you wish to play is fine to me as well! I do tend to play more \u201cdominant\u201d characters, so I\u2019ve bolded the roles that I see myself playing \u2013 but everything is negotiable of course!\n\n* **THE LONG, SILVER NIGHT** \\- The human world and the demon world are separated by an enigmatic substance, the Silver. It is said that humans who disappear have been spirited away past the Silver, never to return again. In this world, **a demon** has great need of a Darkling \u2013 a human who has been spirited into the demon realm, who is granted dark power in exchange for never seeing the human world again. A Darkling\u2019s essence will give the demoness strength \u2013 but what are their ambitions? Why does she need this power? And what of the human \u2013 what dark power will they manifest, and how will they take in this strange, new world that they\u2019ve been forced to call their home?\n* **YOUR HAND IN MIND** \u2013 The heir to a dwindling, dying kingdom has been matched with the heir to another \u2013 a kingdom so strong and power that their might is forever blinding. But **the heir\u2019s match** is domineering, arrogant, crass and bold \u2013 it is not a good fit, and their patience wanes thin. The heir to the dying kingdom takes solace in the friendship they have with their **bodyguard**, the only friendly face they have in this new world\u2026 (A love triangle, where I\u2019d play the partner your character is engaged to, and the bodyguard, who your character also falls for! Let\u2019s mix this up with court intrigue and drama!)\n\nHere\u2019s some other general plot themes that I love, but I don\u2019t have a concrete plot for, but I\u2019d love to cook something up with you!\n\n* Magical boarding schools\n* Cults, or anything involving the occult, or witchcraft\n* Vampires, demons, creatures of the night! I love Anne Rice-style vampires: beautiful, immortal, tortured.\n* Werewolves! I love alpha/omega romances, with me as the alpha!\n* Cyberpunk -- I\u2019ve never done a cyberpunk RP, but I\u2019ve always wanted to! If you\u2019ve got ideas, let me know!\n\nI realize I don\u2019t have a ton of ideas here, but I really love brainstorming and plotting together! So if you have an idea that involves even a touch of magic, I can guarantee, there\u2019s a good chance that I\u2019m interested!\n\nPlease shoot me a message with a little bit about you as a roleplayer, some ideas you have! Also, please send me your Discord username so I can add you and we can talk further there! I look forward to hearing from ya!",

I feel lazy sometimes too. But at least I try to give it my best. And before this turns into a rant about not-so-great partners I'll talk to you about what I want/am looking for. \n\n\n-A unique roleplay.\n\n\nJust that. Really. But to be honest I'd like it to be involved with romance, buuut it's not that important. Really. I just don't want it to be generic? Or I don't know. I just don't want a role-play with a lazy plot. I've got some ideas, but I'd like to hear yours first, if you're interested that is. Also. I want to point out that I'm going to be busy a lot this week, but I'll try to respond whenever I can\n\nWell. That's all. If you think this post is intriguing, how about you hit me up?

English is my second language but I do my best as you can see. \n\nI've had this idea for awhile and I've seen many others do it too. Marvel based S.H.I.E.L.D themed to be exact. The age of the avengers have come to pass, now its up for the new generation of heroes to come forward and save the world. \n\nAt the S.H.I.E.L.D academy the new recruits come to learn the ins and outs of being a hero from combat training to basic human emotions. Some of the recruits are children of past heroes and some are new comers learning their abilities and talents and coming to terms with who they are. Not all will make it and not all may become heroes. Will their friendships and bonds bring them to be the new avengers or will they drift and become solo heroes or even villains. The world before them is vast and their talents or skills will play a big part in how the world recieves them. \n\nNow young hero welcome to S.H.I.E.L.D,  your training began as soon as you set foot in the academy. Good luck and best wishes.",

I currently only have two I still rp with that I met years ago, but they are so busy with life now that posts are really slow.\nI really would like to find a new friend to actively rp with me!\n\nIm really into Fantasy elements, and will definitely be most motivated to write for them. (Werewolves, vampires, warlocks/mages, magic, elves, etc etc. not all in one rp ofc. These are just examples of some of these elements) I prefer to write for original worlds with original characters as well.\n\nAs some basic rules:\n\n- Literate! (3RD person, past tense. Should be able to easily get out a large post if it\u2019s needed.)\n\n-Activity! (Please be active. I do sometimes work, in which I\u2019ll always let you know if I am that day and when I get off, but my hours are not very long. I can get out a LOT of posts in a day if needed, so I\u2019d prefer if my partner could do the same)\n\n-I only play Female main characters, but I don\u2019t mind playing males on the side. I also prefer FxM main characters, but side characters can be FxF or MxM\n\nI prefer Messenger over everything else, but if that\u2019s not possible to rp on, then we can figure something out.\nPlease dm me if you are interested!\nThanks!",

            "selftext": "***Everything below is intended for ages 18+ .***\n\nHi  there. 33 year old here seeking RP. I am in EST/EDT in the United  States (GMT -4), and I am a full time worker with a need for play.\n\n***Basic Requirements and Options***\n\nDiscord is necessary. I also have Kik, but I use my PC &amp; mobile both for play (which Kik doesn't have a PC app for yet).\n\nI am wanting to play opposite female characters with a male, female, anything in between. **BIG  POINTS FOR YOU IF YOU ARE WANTING A NON-BINARY CHARACTER (let's say  that these characters don't function as typical male or female) OPPOSITE  YOUR FEMALE CHARACTER :)**\n\n***What do I like to play?***\n\n\\-Modern OR modern fantasy (**slice of life, drama, so on. I love the whole \"love, marriage, baby carriage\" angle in any relationship I do in a story**). **SINCE IT IS THE HOLIDAYS, WHY NOT TRY OUT A HOLIDAY ROMANCE TYPE OF PLAY? LET ME KNOW IF YOU ARE INTRIGUED!**\n\n\\-Historical  or historical fantasy (usually I love play in the 1940s/1950s/1960s,  but can go to other decades depending on what's offered)\n\n\\-Fandoms (A few are Marvel/DC, including the Arrowverse/DCAU, Once Upon a Time, Star Wars, **GoT/ASoIaF (depending if people are not put off by Season 8)**, Peaky Blinders, **Harry Potter/Fantastic Beasts/Wizarding World,** Vikings, The Last Kingdom, **The Boys**; **Friday Night Lights).** Anime is in here too, such as Code Geass, Gundam, Fullmetal Alchemist, Naruto, Bleach, Yu-Gi-Oh...\n\n\\-Ask me if anything above is not listed for, say, fandoms\n\n***Writing and RP Style***\n\nI  play third person. Please, no first person. I also love visuals,  especially face claims. I usually depend on them. I tend to use  actors/actresses/models and the occasional art. I have some to offer if  any are open to them.\n\nI favor  adult level writing and want the same from who I play with. No FADE TO  BLACK. PERIOD. I can do it any which way for content, and I also love  those who want to talk OOC.\n\n***What is the catch?***\n\nI got it down to three simple statements:\n\n1. I  am on daily, but I will have AFKs like anyone else. If you have any  AFKs, please give me a heads up. I usually give someone a week of  silence before I move on.\n2. I  love players who are open minded and don't let tiny things set them  off. I've met people that were set off by small things. I hope to meet  players who are tougher skinned.\n3. If we end up parting ways, I'll respect you for saying something as long as you have the courage to say it.\n\n***Conclusion***\n\nIf  you are interested, please message me with your Discord name + 4 digit  number &amp; add in a \"marvelous\" somewhere in your response - be sure  to have what you're seeking particularly in your response, please, or be  ready for twenty questions. I look forward to meeting all of you!\n\n***Everything above is intended for ages 18+ .***",

            "selftext": "Hello there, and thank you for picking my post to read through :)\n\nNow, here I\u2019ll give a description on everything you need to know and what not. But first, I\u2019ll start off with a bit of information about myself! For one I\u2019m a female in America to say the least, I love rock &amp; roll and to roleplay too (well duh). I love most animals and to draw as well... And that\u2019s pretty much anything interesting about me. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nOnto the roleplay aspect of this.\n\nFor one I am decently literate when it comes to roleplay. My vocabulary isn\u2019t the largest but I like to write decently sized responses, (or so-called posts) with decent description and thought. In return, I would love for someone who can write about 2 average paragraphs for posts. I don\u2019t ask for much but for enthusiasm and thought put into it! Being that each paragraph has about 5 sentences or so, and I\u2019m lenient a lot of the time too :)\n\nI prefer playing the female character, and I also roleplay in 3rd person too. Personally I like roleplays that have romance involved or as the main plot, being that I love a good twist or a bit of drama in it as well. Though the themes I particularly like are supernatural or high school (or simply regular human life roleplays, realistic ones as well). Anything along those lines I\u2019m usually okay with, if you have a idea or not sure on something just ask and I\u2019ll be honest! \n\nFor my roleplay partner i would love someone who is usually active and can respond at least often enough to keep a decent roleplay going. I also know people get busy at times and etc, and I completely understand that too! At least someone who can respond within a hour is preferred, as I\u2019m in eastern timezone as well. (Preferably someone around the same timezone, so no ones sleep schedules are messed up.)\n\nUsually I am okay with some NSFW themes intertwined into the rp, (aka ERP, or things of that matter as of dark themes.) But also want to develop a plot and characters as well. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nRoleplay ideas: (lets say I use a character named Hazel in these)\n\n- Hazel and your character have been shipped off to a boarding academy on a island in the middle of the ocean. They don\u2019t know each other, but have somehow been assigned to live in the same dorm like place (which is more like a small apartment).\n   - This idea can be plotted out many different ways, but here\u2019s just a small starter to get things going! \n\n- Both of our characters meet in a bar, with Hazel being drunk out of her mind and all alone too. But your character catches on and takes her home, taking care of her while she is in a drunken state and making sure she doesn\u2019t hurt herself too much. Your character soon finds out she\u2019s all alone in life, and doesn\u2019t have much of anywhere to go...\n    - once again, small starter to get things going and can be plotted different ways :)\n\n- Our characters, both werewolves \u2014 are from rivalry packs with one another. They don\u2019t know each other exist, but one strange meeting in the woods says differently. From there a strong bond forms (possibly love) and they can\u2019t separate. But, their packs were enemies and they both know, but can\u2019t seem to stay away from each other. So, what will they do?\n    - Just a little plot line that we can put in smaller details into \n\nThose are just some small ideas! Personally I like the first one, and I\u2019m open to similar themes and plots like these, just ask and we can maybe work something out :) \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAnd that\u2019s it! I mainly prefer discord for the roleplay, but PM me on here first so we can work something out before switching to discord. If you don\u2019t have discord but interested, once again PM me and we can work something out :) (honestly I just want some good roleplay haha)\n\n*I would also like to create small character sheets too before we start, so we genuinely know each other\u2019s characters.*",

But my schedule is finally going back to normal &amp; I am needing a new roleplay partner! Something fresh, and new.  \n\nI am usually free all day every day. If for some reason I'm not I will let you know, &amp; will try to respond in a timely manner. I am female but I don't mind playing a different gender. But I do prefer my partner to play male. Whether is M/F or M/M. I don't mind playing multiple characters! I've done that a lot over the years as well.\n\nI do like elements of romance, but I like the flirtation of the characters ending up together. The chase. Maybe they don't even like each other at first? But this is your roleplay too, feel free to tell me your likes/dislikes; wants/needs. So we can work something out. I tend to write around 500 words, (I'll send an example of a usual response.) You don't have to match my length, but put effort forth. I expect you to be literate.\n\nPROMPTS- I love fantasy, but not really mild fantasy? Like I love supernatural type of stuff. ( Vampires, Shifters, Witches, Gods, Demons, Angels etc.) I've been feening for a good partner. Someone I can collaborate with, I love hearing other people's ideas, and coming up with something we can both enjoy. The type of rp where you await the others response. I do have a world of my own that I've created over the years. (If you're interested in hearing about it just let me know.) If you have your own world that you'd like to tell me about, go for it. If you want to come up with something entirely new, lets do it. If any of this interests you at all, message me! (I have DISCORD, but tell me if you prefer something else.)",

I had this idea that he actually wakes up and decides to go after Angela instead of letting her die because she is a real person and neither of the women in his life are, lol.    I liked the idea of maybe also him attempting to save her and dragging her into his nonsense with reviving Mary via the cult and everything goes wrong.   \n\nIf I can't get a James, I'd like someone who could deal substitute James and we could figure it out from there.  Feel free to message me/chat me for my discord.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote: I'm looking only for adults, I roleplay multiple paragraphs 3-10 and I should get something close to that back, but it is flexible for quality vs quantity.  I do some NSFW when it is important to the plot, but because it is Silent Hill it's going to be crazy, so at least know some of the lore from 2.",

            "selftext": "Hey everyone! It's been a few months since I've posted here on reddit, I'm gonna be honest I kind of forgot about it, lol. But recently I've lost touch with my previous Roleplay partner (we still RP from time to time, and still keep in touch, just rarely. I completely understand though, life gets super busy sometimes!) and I've been seriously craving some more RPing. \n\nTo start off, I RP on discord. If that's a problem, maybe we can work something out!! But I never ever RP on e-mail. Second, I don't usually RP fandoms, sorry! I love coming up with original stories and plots and characters. \n\nNow that that's out of the way, if you're interested in a fantasy or apocalyptic setting, let me know! These two are my absolute favorite to RP, but I'm always interested in your ideas. If you're interested in a different setting, like modern, also don't be afraid to hit me up! I'm down for whatever! \n\nI always have tons and tons of ideas, so I'm sure we can come up with something. If we're RP partners, I would love talking to you out of RP as well! We can come up with silly/cute headcanons for our characters, or just chat! \n\nOkay, this post is already pretty long, but I just want to add a few more things. If you've seen my other posts on here, I talk about a Prince/Knight plot. You can check out my first ever post for more details! Basically, this is my absolute favorite trope/dynamic ever. Usually I Roleplay as the prince character, since I'm better and more comfortable writing it, and relate to these kinds of characters more. But I'm pretty flexible, so I'm always down to try new characters! Just a heads up, I might not be too good at it, haha. It'll be a super fun romantic plot! Message me if you're interested in this type of fantasy setting for more details! \n\nAs for an apocalyptic setting, I really love them! I think it would be amazing to come up with our own monsters and characters together. I also think it'll be fun to try and balance romance and survival into a RP. We could totally come up with more details if you're interested! \n\nSo, this basically wraps up this post. Sorry it was kind of long! I really hope to hear from anyone interested in either of these two fantasy or apocalyptic settings/plots! Just shoot me a message anytime!",

As for what I\u2019m looking for, I\u2019m not clear on what I\u2019m looking for plot-wise, but I can tell you this: \n\nI love romance, and it\u2019s a definite must, whether it\u2019s FxF or MxF, and I always play female. I\u2019m into drama, action, dark themes, supernatural, slice of life, horror, adventure, and pretty much all of the above. My imagination has troubles when it comes to fantasy and magic, though. \n\nI\u2019m pretty much willing to do any genre or plots that you may have, and if neither of us have a fleshed out idea it\u2019s always fun to create one together and continue creating together as we go along! \n\nLet me also mention this: I\u2019m not looking for a sex-based roleplay, but enjoy including it into the story as it fits, with an appropriate build. \n\nMy preference for style is 1st person, but I can do 3rd as well. I don\u2019t care about post length, and think a paragraph is just fine. I cannot find 2+ paragraphs fun, as I feel like it hinders the partners\u2019 abilities to move the story along. It\u2019s just easier to bounce off of replies when they\u2019re shorter, especially with dialogue. \n\nIf you have any prompts, plots, or ideas you\u2019d like to discuss or roleplay, send me a message so we can get to creating something together. I hope you took time to read this, I tried to keep it short, so if you have any further comments/questions, message me! Thanks, Bailey.",

            "selftext": "Summary: In a world where anomalous humans (referred to as metahumans) exist, humanity has done its best to ensure the threat they pose is neutralized. In doing so, however, they inadvertently push them to the fringes of society where their natural talents are often sought after by those with broken moral compasses.\n\nMy Character: Dante Narvaez was born into the lap of luxury in Lazaro Cardenas, Mexico in 2001. The only son of powerful Los Zetas cartel jefe Jos\u00e9 Narvaez and his wife Luisa, he was raised with a silver spoon and wanted for nothing. Yet the start of the Mexican Drug War in 2006 changed the Narvaez family forever. Squeezed between rival cartels and the government, then forced into a brutal struggle for survival, Jos\u00e9 waged war with the utmost brutality -- earning the respect and fear of every narco in the game. Even as he ascended to the top of the food chain and earned the nickname Dios de la Muerte for his cold-blooded efficiency, he was still just a man.\n\nIn 2008 Jos\u00e9 Narvaez was killed by an assassin sent by the Sinaloa Cartel. Aided by the DEA in exchange for intelligence on ongoing cartel operations, Luisa fled north with Dante to the United States.\n\nAlthough America was not his home and English was his second language, Dante excelled academically. Just after his 14th birthday he began to demonstrate peculiar physical traits, including inhumanly fast reflexes and running speed. At first his teachers thought he was simply athletically gifted, but as he began to break high school records in baseball, soccer, and football some began to suspect there was more to him than met the eye. He was subsequently tested for a metahuman gene and, upon confirmation of a positive result, quarantined by the elite Metahuman Control Group and slated for transportation to the remote maximum security Attu Island Research Center built in the 1980s to contain metahumans.\n\nUnfortunately, during his initial quarantine, rivals from his father's past discovered the whereabouts of his mother and murdered her. Had it not been for Frederick Elliot breaking him out of quarantine he would've never had even the slightest chance at avenging her. Since then he's worked as an enforcer for the shadowy ex-CIA figure and his criminal organization. Like his father, he's made a name for himself in the underworld and despite his youth he's learned well from his father's mistakes.\n\nWhat I'm Seeking: A partner interested in playing a character that either works with Dante or is his rival. Human, metahuman, or other supernaturals are all fine. I'd also be open to some sort of crossover with MCU canon characters, but it'd obviously depend. \n\nNSFW scenes are likely as they come up.",

I prefer it        when people are creative and don't ask me for the plot  beforehand   and      instead develop the roleplay in the very moment of its    writing.      Time-wise you should be available every other day   (naturally,  the  more     frequent the better) though it's less a   strict requirement than   a   wish   to keep the flow going.\n\n**What can  I offer?**\n\nI have about 10 years of experience with all kinds of  roleplays, in terms of language I can offer English and German.\n\n**What settings do I RP in/What characterds do I want to play?**\n\nHere's a few suggestion, though I'm open minded.\n\n1. Anything set in the Fallout (4) universe\n2. A post-modern homeless girl living on the streets\n3. Any alternative idea you have, as long as it is not based on anime heh ;)\n\nYou    can play ANY character you like in those settings, be creative :) It    can be a companion, an acquaintance, a stranger or perhaps even    antagonist.\n\n**How would I want the RP-Style to be?**\n\nPersonally         I prefer to type emotes without any special markings and spoken     text    in direct quotes, spoken texts of \"NPCs\" in  single-apostrophe. I    dont    mind  if you prefer a different style,  as long as it's     distinguishable.\n\nIn     terms of    paragraph  length I prefer rather short but descriptive    sentences.    When entering  a new setting (a new room for example),  longer       paragraphs may be  appropriate but bloated 200-Words essays  disrupt the       flow in my  opinion.\n\nNSFW content is principially possible, for as long as it is congruent with the rest of the roleplay and appropriate.\n\nI'm looking forward to your DMs,\n\nElena-Mar\u00eda",

Be as \"shallow\" as you want when it comes to my looks since I\u2018m asking the same.\n\nWhen it comes to our starlet in question, I'd like you to play her as you see fit without being mean. Yell at your manager for not getting you into the room for an audition, not me. I get called useless enough in my normal life, why would I want that here too \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f? It may sound like I\u2019m asking for a Disney princess or saint but that\u2019s not true. Don\u2019t be rude. Attitudes are welcome, aggressively looking to argue all the time or fight is not. Maybe that's something we work with together. \"Babe, it's just your Starbucks order calm down. Not like they're engraving your Oscar.\"\n\nI\u2019m sure as some have done, maybe, some of you are probably going over my past prompts with a fine tooth comb and have noticed a lot of smut posts. I do post a lot, I won\u2019t lie to you. But dig deeper. There\u2019s story around them, substance. Will adult things be part of this? Absolutely, but it won\u2019t be the focus. \n\nSo who are we to each other at the beginning or down the road if we start at peak career? Could be anyone. Acquaintances? Friends set us up on a blind date? Tinder? Are you a fan of my work whatever that may be and have your people talk to my people to set up a meeting? Dating website? Neighbors? Talk your way out of a ticket? You notice an extra muffin one day in your to go bag with a note *on the house*?\n\nSo, women. Who do I like? In bold are who I'm leaning towards but all are up for play time. Someone missing? Feel free to ask or suggest:\n\nCelebrities, adult stars, wrestlers, internet personalities: Adriana Lima, Adrianne Palicki, AJ Lee, Alektra Blue, **Alexa Bliss (WWE), Alexandra Daddario**, Alice Eve, Alicia Vikander, **Alison Brie, Alison Haislip**, Allie (AEW), Allison Parker, Amanda Seyfried, **Amber Heard**, Amy Adams, **Angelina Jolie, Anna Kendrick, Anne Hathaway**, Anya Taylor-Joy, **April O'Neil, Asa Akira**, Aubrey Plaza, Ayumi Anime, Bella Thorne, **Blake Lively, Brie Larson**, Britney Spears, **Brooke Adams (Miss Tessmacher)**, Bryce Dallas Howard, **Caity Lotz**, Carice Van Houten, **Carrie Underwood**, Carter Cruise, Charlize Theron, **Chloe Bennet**, Christian Serratos, Christina Hendricks, **Daisy Ridley, Dakota Johnson, Deborah Ann Woll, Elizabeth Olsen, Emilia Clarke, Emily Bett Rickards, Emily Blunt**, Emma Dumont, Emma Stone, Emmy Rossum, Esperanza Gomez, Eva Green, **Eva Lovia**, Farrah Abraham, **Gabbie Hanna, Gal Gadot, Hailee Steinfeld, Hayden Paneteirre, Hayley Atwell**, Jaimie Alexander, Jamie Chung, Janina Gavanker, Jasmine Jae, Jenna Marbles, **Jennifer Lawrence, Jennifer Lopez, Jessica Alba**, Jessica Biel, **Jessica Chastain, Karen Gillan**, Kate Beckinsale, Kate Mara, Kate Upton, **Katie Cassidy, Katrina Law**, Katy Perry, Kelly Kelly, **Kelsi Monroe, Kendra Sunderland**, Kristen Bell, **Lady Gaga, Lana (WWE), Lana Rhoades**, Lauren Cohan, Lea Michele, Lena The Plug, Lily James, Lindsay Lohan, Lizzy Caplan, Madison Ivy, Malin Akerman, **Mandy Moore, Margot Robbie, Maria Kanellis (WWE)**, Marisa Tomei, McKayla Maroney, **Megan Fox, Melissa Benoist, Mia Malkova**, Michelle Jenneke, Mickie James (WWE), Milana Vayntrub, Monica Bellucci, Naomi Scott, Natalie Alyn Lind, Natalie Dormer, Natalie Portman, Nathalie Emmanuel, Nicole Aniston, Nicole Scherzinger, Noelle Foley (Mick Foley's daughter), **Olivia Munn**, Oona Chaplin, **Paige (WWE), Peyton Royce (WWE)**, Rachel Brosnahan, Rachel McAdams, Reese Witherspoon, Ronda Rousey, Rose Byrne, Salma Hayek, **Sara Jean Underwood, Scarlett Bordeaux, Scarlett Johansson, Shakira**, Shantel VanSanten, Sophie Turner, Stacy Keibler (WWE), Summer Rae (WWE), Tatiana Maslany, Taynara Conti (WWE), Tenille Dashwood (WWE), Toni Storm, Torrie Wilson (WWE), Whitney Cummings. **ALL WOMEN AND CHARACTERS WILL BE 18+**\n\nI do have some, requirements:\n\n- If you\u2019re looking to get the degraded or humiliated throughout our time together I\u2019m sorry for wasting your time. At no point will my character treat you like garbage. You want to get taken advantage of in the RP? That\u2019s all fine and dandy, just know I won\u2019t do it.\n\n- Please, *please* be available more than once a week or a day to get some solid back and forth going. Three days gone, cool, life happens. But don\u2019t pop up in two weeks acting like everything is fine especially if you\u2019re posting too. We\u2019re not working out? Just say it.\n\n- Please be thorough and descriptive but not overbearing. Who, whose, who\u2019s. There, their. Those will most likely be misplaced occasionally but it won\u2019t be a constant issue. I won\u2019t ask perfection from you, please don\u2019t expect perfection from me.\n\nEffort, just a bit of effort is all I\u2019m asking for.\n\nSo what do you say? Let's get to it. If you've read this and have a setup you've been dying to get off the ground, go for it!",

I usually like my roleplays a little more on the lighter side, with just general SoL tropes. I don't like high fantasy or to get into any too crime-ridden or dark themes. Just trying to have some fun and romance and maybe a dash (okay two dashes) of smut. \n\nWe can do highschool/college students, or roommates or co-workers, or neighbors. I'm not too picky, I'd just like to have a few long-term RP partners to help me escape from my stressful life.\n\nWe can do it on KiK or Discord, or whatever really, just send me a PM and we can go from there.\n\nThank you for reading.",

            "selftext": "\nHey everyone, I\u2019m looking for any rp\u2019ers of semi-literate or novella skill level to take part in a fun scifi-themed rp, with inspirations from Ms. Kobayashi\u2019s Dragon Maid, Expelled from Paradise, Planetary Annihilation, and Invader Zim. \n\nMillions of years ago, several galaxies away from the milky way, there was the Contingency, an ancient machine race, bent on gaining knowledge by conquering all the other races of the universe. By assimilating the knowledge of species, they hoped to learn the secrets of existence itself, even enough to perhaps end the heat death of the universe itself. But after many different organic races united against the Contingency, a great war erupted, but ultimately led to the destruction of Nekro\u2019s kind, except one. \n\nJettisoned off into space during one of the skirmishes leading up to the final battle of the Contingency\u2019s homeworld, Nekro-67 was one of many of the race\u2019s control hubs, a synaptic control center responsible for the Contingency\u2019s countless legions of worker and military drones. Created as an alternative for the current Hub ruling over Contingency Sector A-27, she was left in stasis in the event of the current hub being destroyed in the war.(edited)\n\nLaunched from one of the Contingent\u2019s war fleets into empty space, with not much regard to where Nekro, and a small number of her machine kin, would end up... mostly out of hopes of creating new bastions of the Contingency. Nekro-67 drifted aimlessly in space for millions of years, far from her own galaxy until finally ending up in the gravity well of a nearby galaxy, the milky way, before ending up in a young Solar System and crash landing in the Rocky Mountain range, where a young, female astronomer just happened to be watching. \n\nFeel free to comment here or shoot me a pm with your discord name. Either role is fine with me, so don\u2019t be shy! \n\nThanks everyone!",

            "selftext": "Hello, you can call me Doe! I'm in my 20s, a student, and a proud cat mom. I write multiple paragraphs/novella style (200-500+ words). I love to write detailed descriptions and delve into a character\u2019s head/emotions as well as surroundings. I compare it to writing a novel together.\n\nI understand if the scene doesn\u2019t have alot going on and therefore requires less like rapid fire. I adore having long, thoughtful replies where we truly immerse ourselves in the world. I'm hoping to find a partner whose as enthusiastic and passionate about the plot and writing as I am. When I get invested in a story, it\u2019s 100% dedication. Getting a reply is the highlight of my day.\n\nI'm a big fan of romance and using face claims. I\u2019m the type to make pinterest boards, spam you with gifs, headcanons, and send you songs that remind me of our characters and/or ship. I'll get excited if we come up with a great plot idea or if our characters are being cute or going to get into trouble. I live for this kind of stuff honestly.\n\nLast but not least I only do MxF (with myself in the female role) and don\u2019t double, but I\u2019m more than happy to write side characters of either gender to help move the story along. I'd highly prefer female authors writing male characters. Male authors, please stop contacting me. I've been burned too many times. If you persist, I'll ignore your message. Sorry!\n\nDesperately Searching For\n\n- 21+ partners\n\n- For you to have an excellent grasp of grammar, punctuation, spelling, and capitalization. Both in character and out of character. (Literate to advanced writers only, please. I'm not looking for newbies).\n\n- The more description, the better! I'm looking for someone can write as much as me (2 to 4 paragraphs or more) and really bring the story to life. I lose interest if I'm the only one that's invested/enthusiastic or coming up with plot ideas. Quality writing makes my heart happy, as does world building together.\n\n- The use of real life face claims and joining me in the wonderful world of ship/character development isn't a requirement but I'd sure be delighted if we were on the same page in this regard. (I won't use anime faces, only realistic art if you're uncomfortable with real life)\n\n- Someone who won't leave without warning or explanation after sending the first post. I'm looking for the long term here, and I have been greatly saddened by how many partners have left me high and dry recently.\n\nIf you've made it this far, thank you! You won't be disappointed in writing with me. I tend to be online daily and I'd like it if you were too. Please let me know if you're going to be inactive, long days/weeks of silence make me nervous.\n\nOriginal Genres:\n\n- Mafia/Crime\n\n- Post Apocalyptic/Dystopia\n\n- Supernatural/Modern Fantasy\n\n- Southern/Mid-Western/Urban Gothic\n\n- Modern Mythology/Fairytale Retellings\n\n- Sci-fi\n\n- Cyberpunk/Retro-Futuristic\n\n- Superpowers/Gifted\n\n(I also have an original Star Wars plot in mind if anyone's interested) \n\nAll my characters will be adults and I require my partners to do the same. For more plot and more genre ideas, message me ^^ I prefer to write over email but use discord for chatting and writing, along with google docs.\n\nPlease be detailed when you message me, let me know why you chose to contact me. Seeing only \"hey do you wanna rp?\" is a guaranteed way to turn me off.\n\nLook forward to hearing from you!",

The current plot is centered around the aftermath of a major supervillain's break out, which has since set crime rates skyrocketing and set in motion a movement against the hero system. \n\nWe have a ranking system for characters set in place, as well as a work-in-progress economy for bounties on both heroes and villains alike! More features will be added as time progresses, and we'll be working with the community to see what we can do to improve the roleplay. \n\nOur invite link is here:  [https://discord.gg/khRY6un](https://discord.gg/khRY6un) \n\nHope to see you guys!",

This is a specific search just for Star Wars RPs about OC x canon or canon c canon pairings. \n\nI am a 20+ female, who has had 5 years roleplay experience and usually writes at least one or two paragraphs, but can easily do more. I love to create OCs and see other people\u2019s OCs and also pair them with canon characters.\nIn terms of doubling, I am quite open and will soon list the characters I can play for you after I listed which I am interested to play against. \n\nThe only requirements I have for you is that you don\u2019t write one liners and if we double, you keep both sides equal length. \n\nSo, what am I willing to roleplay?\n\nI am dying to have an OC x canon RP with my OC against either Anakin or Kylo Ren/Ben Solo. I am also not opposed to play against Poe Dameron, Obi Wan or Han Solo.\n\nIn case of doubling (regarding both canon x canon and canon x oc), I can play as Leia, Rey, Obi-Wan, Luke Skywalker, Poe Dameron. Just ask for more tho!\n\nI am also dying to do a good Reylo RP. I absolutely love them!\nBeside them, I also ship Hanleia and some little Reypoe or Stormpilot. \n\nI hope to hear from you soon!",

            "selftext": "The dust has settled on the greatest war ever to face mankind. Fight, or go extinct. Those were the stakes, and with their backs against the wall for the last 28 years, Humanity has finally obtained some breathing room, but at what cost? Billions dead, dozens, hundreds of worlds glassed, even throwing children into the fiery crucible of war simply to trade their lives for time.\n\nEven now, fractured remnants of the Covenant continue to stalk the black of space, no longer the genocidal menace they were only a year ago, but still a dangerous threat. The Sangheilli, once a foe that had pushed Humanity into the pit that nearly became their grave, are the other half of a fragile alliance strained by politics and Human screams for the dead over what was all a lie perpetuated by three 'Prophets'.\n\nThe Spartans of the Human-Covenant War have gone down in history as legends, near mythological in their status as walls that the alien tide smashed against again and again. Propaganda posters of Spartans in olive drab armor of different makes and variants, standing in the middle of fields of dead Covenant, helping wounded Marines onto their medical extractions, even showing massive damage to their armor but still standing, still fighting. Later, others appeared. When Reach fell under the pillars of glassing beams, Spartans in multicolored, mismatched armor materialized on the battlefield, sometimes turning the tide of the battle for another few hours, another few days.\n\nToday, another generation of Spartans are brought into play, containing the remnants of the Spartan IIs and IIIs, the Titans and Greek Gods of the Great War. Now, the Spartan IVs take on the mantle, merely the likes of Hercules compared to those such as Cronos or Zeus, but Spartans nonetheless.\n\nWith a galaxy slowly heating up again around the battered remains of Humanity, the UNSC's Spartans will continue to pick up the mantle of defense. One question remains:\n\nWhat will you do?\n\n------\n\nHiya! Long post, I know, but I'm looking for someone willing to play a Spartan from the Halo universe, post-Covenant War.\n\nThis will be breaking the current canon because I hate it, and I want another direction for a series I love. So, that being said, this could go basically anywhere. Anti-piracy, dealing with Jackals in stolen ships. Counter-Insurgency, fighting back against a newly revived Insurrection now that the Covenant has stopped its genocidal rampage. Maybe even slice of life, dealing with less action and more day-to-day type stuff. With any luck, it'll be a mix of different things.\n\nNow, canonically, the Spartan IVs have rolled the IIs and IIIs of previous generations into the Spartan Branch, so IIs and IIIs are on the table as well, within reason. But, I'm open to changes here and there without changing the basic idea of it. Spartans, superhuman but... still Human underneath the hardened exterior and, sometimes, the lost childhoods.\n\nPlease be at least 18+, preferably someone 20+, because a lot can go on with this prompt that I'm more comfortable with roleplaying with someone that's closer to my age. I prefer paragraph or novella style replies because I can get carried away with mine and one liners just won't do. Short replies are fine, but not constantly, otherwise I'll end up getting bored. A paragraph at least, please. I'm in the EST timezone, and I'm available often, but there are times I can get dragged into other things and my time is taken from me. I'm a sucker for a good romance done right, so I'd love to include that in there, but definitely don't wanna force it.\n\nSo, if this looks like something you're interested in, please message me!",

            "selftext": "Quirks. A worldly phenomenon that gave about 80% of people in the world extraordinary abilities. The first of this phenomenon was in Qing Qing City, China. The child was lit up like a light bulb. From there, the world\u2019s population began manifesting these Quirks and every 4 out of 5 people had one.\n\nAmerica was no different. And soon vigilantism, as well as crime, rose. Soon, the US Government got involved and, like a few other countries, gave out hero licenses to those willing to become the heroes the country needed.\n\nThis new profession gave way to a seemingly more peaceful country. One where crime was lowered and civilization advanced.\n\nThe world is on its 6th or 7th generations of quirk users. And most want to become heroes are aiming for best high school in the country for becoming a hero. Deliverance Academy! Located in Chicago\u2019s sister city: Serenity.\n\nDeliverance Academy, the country's top hero school opens its doors for new 1st year students every year! Of the usual 1000+ applicants, the school usually only takes about 1% of them for their Hero Studies.\n\nDeliverance's Hero Courses are taught by A-Rank or higher Heroes. Each teaching the best ways to become a hero. And each one a bonafide hero.\nSo please look [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeliveranceRp/wiki/index) and join the Academy today!\n\n---\n\nThat\u2019s right a My Hero Academia Roleplay here on Reddit! This is about our own OC School located in the USA. We are in a Christmas Break but will be back in early January! NOW is the time to make a character!\n\n All used characters are original Creations. If needed help developing a quirk idea, we mods can help with that. We also have a community Discord: https://discord.gg/ttQV4Xd\n\n***ALSO***\n\nWe are opening applications for teacher positions! Want to create and run classes? Please send us an application for your A-rank Hero!",

            "selftext": "Hey thanks for taking the time to read my post. I don\u2019t post here very often so sorry in advance if my post seems lack luster.\n\nAnyways, with new life flowing back into the Halo community. I figured now would be a good time to get something going in terms of a roleplay. My Ideas are a work in progress so if you\u2019re still interested then I\u2019d love to see if we can work on a story together.\n\nMy Ideas Include:\n- Spartan Head Hunters.\nWe are two ONI Head Hunters who operates effectively alone. So after seeing so much success from the two of us, ONI decides to slap us into one team. Problem is that we don\u2019t know how to work on a team.\n\n- We Drop as ODST into New Mombasa\nThis one is a little more straightforward we basically take the role of troopers countering the covenants first landing on earth. And that\u2019s about all I have hehe. This can be built upon.\n\n- Colonist survivors\nThis one is also a bit more straight forward. Basically we are ordinary colonists, and when the covenant invades we are forced to survive. We can turn this into a red dawn scenario or even just manage to get off planet. This is obviously something that requires work.\n\nIf your interested in any of these prompts or if you\u2019re looking to bring something else to the table don\u2019t hesitate to contact me. I should get back to you fairly soon if you message me. See you soon",

            "selftext": "Hello, you can call me Doe! I'm in my 20s, a student, and a proud cat mom. I write multiple paragraphs/novella style (200-500+ words). I love to write detailed descriptions and delve into a character\u2019s head/emotions as well as surroundings. I compare it to writing a novel together.\n\nI understand if the scene doesn\u2019t have alot going on and therefore requires less like rapid fire. I adore having long, thoughtful replies where we truly immerse ourselves in the world. I'm hoping to find a partner whose as enthusiastic and passionate about the plot and writing as I am. When I get invested in a story, it\u2019s 100% dedication. Getting a reply is the highlight of my day.\n\nI'm a big fan of romance and using face claims. I\u2019m the type to make pinterest boards, spam you with gifs, headcanons, and send you songs that remind me of our characters and/or ship. I'll get excited if we come up with a great plot idea or if our characters are being cute or going to get into trouble. I live for this kind of stuff honestly.\n\nLast but not least I only do MxF (with myself in the female role) and don\u2019t double, but I\u2019m more than happy to write side characters of either gender to help move the story along. \n\nI'd highly prefer female authors writing male characters. Male authors, please stop contacting me. I've been burned too many times. If you persist, I'll ignore your message. Sorry!\n\nDesperately Searching For\n\n- 21+ partners\n\n- For you to have an excellent grasp of grammar, punctuation, spelling, and capitalization. Both in character and out of character. (Literate to advanced writers only, please. I'm not looking for newbies).\n\n- The more description, the better! I'm looking for someone can write as much as me (2 to 4 paragraphs or more) and really bring the story to life. I lose interest if I'm the only one that's invested/enthusiastic or coming up with plot ideas. Quality writing makes my heart happy, as does world building together.\n\n- The use of real life face claims and joining me in the wonderful world of ship/character development isn't a requirement but I'd sure be delighted if we were on the same page in this regard. (I won't use anime faces, only realistic art if you're uncomfortable with real life)\n\n- Someone who won't leave without warning or explanation after sending the first post. I'm looking for the long term here, and I have been greatly saddened by how many partners have left me high and dry recently.\n\nIf you've made it this far, thank you! You won't be disappointed in writing with me. I tend to be online daily and I'd like it if you were too. Please let me know if you're going to be inactive, long days/weeks of silence make me nervous.\n\nOriginal Genres:\n\n- Mafia/Crime\n\n- Post Apocalyptic/Dystopia\n\n- Supernatural/Modern Fantasy\n\n- Southern/Mid-Western/Urban Gothic\n\n- Modern Mythology/Fairytale Retellings\n\n- Sci-fi\n\n- Cyberpunk/Retro-Futuristic\n\n- Superpowers/Gifted\n\n(I also have an original Star Wars plot in mind if anyone's interested) \n\nAll my characters will be adults (and there will be adult themes). I require my partners to do the same. For more plot and more genre ideas, message me ^^ I prefer to write over email but can use discord for chatting and writing, along with google docs.\n\nPlease be detailed when you message me, let me know why you chose to contact me. Seeing only \"hey do you wanna rp?\" is a guaranteed way to turn me off.\n\nLook forward to hearing from you!",

I have almost a decade of experience now and with a break from university have more time to roleplay. \n\nI have a long list of ideas for us to explore,  anything from a basic marriage,  to pirates, to historical plots, to supernatural ones. I'll discuss the ideas in greater detail in private with anyone who has questions. \n\nI write in first person perspective and don't mind which perspective you choose to use. I try to write a few lines per response, but am also not overly picky about that. \n\nIf you are curious or have any questions please pm me here and I'll try my best to answer your questions. \n\nThank you",

Let's see what happens next.\nOf course I'm looking for someone more than 18 years old. I'm more than 18 years old so we can discuss nfsw topics if there will be that. I prefer a MxM rp.\nMy idea doesn't have to be exactly as I wrote here. We can discuss here. I can rp on Discord or here too. \n\n\nMy idea:\nIt will start since the Android (your character) was created inside the comps and programmed for the first time. The Android is an enforcer and an undercover agents. It can participate in different missions. He can replace real people but he is bot self aware.  After few weeks an strange virus appears and make the Android slowly self aware. That would make the Enterprise scrap the Android.\nAfter 3 months a human (my character) found a damage Android (your character) at the srapyard and \"rescued the Android\".  He did this because he wants to learn how the Android works and maybe use him for a project for college. He will program him as a butler and a bodyguard robot. That Android likes to learn and he has a secret unused the archives from his memory. The Enterprise that made the Android was making illegal experiments. The Android sometimes shows signs of self aware and love to his new owner but also can take hard decisions.  The android will start as a normal machine but he slowly will get emotions and be self aware. \n\nAfter the emotional parts they would find a strange house inside an abandoned town that was bought for the Enterprise. It isn't a normal house. That house was made for replicating memories of the subject that goes inside the place. For example if you get inside and you remember a lot a dog, the dog will be inside the house or at least a photo of your dog. That will happen with people and objects that the subject remembers. But that's not the strange thing here.\nThe most strange things is that after they got inside. The house will replicate the memories of the Android.\n\n\nI like to role-play on Discord. Sadly that's the only way I can Role-play because if you want to share pictures about how an element of the story looks here will be imposible.\nThank you and we will see you later.",

I go by Hannah and I am an experienced, **advanced literate** cis female writer looking for a **female** (NB and non-cis individuals also welcome) long-term writing partner interested in filling the **male** roles in the narratives we dream up. Someone eager to help me create worlds and breathe life into characters that we fall irreparably in love with. I want depth and beauty and drama and writing so delicious you could die. I'm not asking for much, just that special magic that can happen rarely when two talented minds meet a blank page and tackle it together.\n\n# The big compatibility stuff/my preferences:\n\n**\u2661** I have been doing RP/one on one writing in some capacity or another for **\\~nineteen years**. It's why I can write to what I humbly believe to be at least a **somewhat decent** level. Being able to write every single day for months on end for more years of my life than not has given me invaluable experience in character creation, development, world-building, narrative, all of it.\n\n**\u2661** I mention this because I would very much prefer it if you are also on the more **advanced literate** side of the 'Semi-lit&gt;Literate&gt;Advanced literate' spectrum in your writing. I ask that you are fairly experienced, with a firm grasp of spelling, grammar, and storytelling. I **don't** ask that you be perfect, I am a **better storyteller** than I am at grammar and punctuation and all that, for example. But I like to hope that my grasp on everything else makes up for it. I'm gonna make glaring mistakes because the words were just rushing out too fast and I was blinded by the vision of the scene and the things I was trying to convey, but I do try my best, and that's all that I am asking of you.\n\nAll that to say again, we're both human, perfection isn't being sought here, but just write good, k?\n\n**\u2661** **I prefer female writing partners.** NB and non-cis individuals **of course** also welcome. Basically, as long as you weren't socialized as a str8 male, we'll likely get along. And I actually get along great with bi men as well, so you're welcome also. I'm sure that's putting all the str8 cis-dudes reading this right into their feelings, and that's fine, I get it, but this is my preference. I don't care to hear your thoughts on it. The answer is \"No, thank you.\" But best of luck to you. \u2661\u2661\u2661\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- **TLDR: If you're not a straight dude and you want to write the male roles in our stories, and enjoy those roles, PM me!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\u2661** I do **only** play female main characters, and I understand if that is frustrating to you, but that is also my preference. If you don't enjoy playing the main male roles, **do not PM me**. I'm not about asking anyone to do anything they don't want to do. If you don't want to or have hesitations...please don't.\n\n**\u2661** I type much more **casually** in direct conversation via IM/DM, I **overshare** and brainstorm ideas constantly and will flood your messages if you're away with them.\n\n**\u2661** I am **only** interested in **hetero** pairings for our mains.\n\n**\u2661** From time to time I may be interested in F/F pairings of side characters or side characters with my main, and this is about as close to \"doubling\" as I get. This is not a requirement, however. Just something I am open to if it fits the story and both parties are interested.\n\n**\u2661** I prefer **GDocs/E-mail** for the actual writing and **Discord** for ooc chatter and brainstorming. I will bow to pressure if you ONLY use discord servers and you seem like a good potential partner, but I **don't** love the character limitations on there.\n\n**\u2661** I **\\*really\\*** am not comfortable working with anyone younger than around **\\~22+** Like, I have **zero** interest and it'll be a flat **no** from me. Sorry.\n\n**\u2661** I don't know if this is a given, but I also ask that you **help** me populate the **side-characters** as needed for our world and our stories.\n\n**\u2661** I **do not** match **post length** just for the sake of it. I will always try and give as much as I possibly can in a post, but if we need to advance forward, or the post for whatever reason didn't give me a ton to work with or it's mainly dialogue, my reply will be shorter.\n\n**\u2661** **I do not like pre-made characters**. I expect that **all** characters used in our stories are made expressly for those stories. I don't want to hear \"Oh, I have a character that will fit this story.\"\n\n**\u2661** I write in **third person past-tense POV only**.\n\n**\u2661** I **only** use actors and models for **character references**, and I consider character references **necessary**.\n\n**\u2661** **I do not fade to black**, though I do not want those scenes to be the main focus. I welcome them when they are natural and fun, but my focus is story-telling **\u2661**\n\n**\u2661** SO yeah, just to make it a bullet point, I prefer **long-term** writing partners. We can certainly do **one-offs** for cravings, and leave and come back to stories and worlds and plots as we please, we are after all in charge, but I prefer to have one or two steady people I can turn to when I want to work on something either creatively for a few months or to satisfy a craving in the moment that may or may not turn into something long-term we work on or come back to, and to be that person for someone else as well.\n\n**\u2661** I **don't** tend to like playing **canon characters**. I will take ideas from characters and build something new around that, something similar, but still mine. I will also do this with settings, worlds, drawing from TV and movies and comics and books, etc. But I will never play a canon character and for me to play opposite one, as in you playing a canon character, would have to be a huge crave or a lot of convincing and pretense and plot that I like. It's rare, but not 100% unprecedented. (I was DYING for a Punisher RP as soon as season one on Netflix came out, for example.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Take a look at what I am interested in actually writing just below, and if you find your interest piqued further and want to delve into any of these worlds with me and create some characters, get right into it and start brainstorming and seeing if we vibe, please send me a PM. Introduce yourself. If you have writing samples, send them. If you have questions, ask them. Ideas? Tell me them. \u2661\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# \u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\n\n# If you think we would mesh well together, inquire about ideas I have in your introductory PM and we can discuss and I can elaborate.\n\nI love playing around in different decades. Anything from the 1800s and on is fair-game for dabbling in historical or just a more vintage time period to play around with. I'm open to mixing some of the ideas I have here with a different decade setting. I will usually mention a range of decades I find appealing per story/idea.\n\n# CURRENTLY CRAVING -\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe amount of \u2661's denote level of interest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Mainly Slice of Life right now!\n\n**\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661 Slice of life/Love-story**\\- I love creating character-driven stories that are just that, love stories in what is largely a slice of life story. That's not to say that I like SOL that is boring. There is still plenty of room to incorporate emotion and drama and layer on depth wherever we can. Some of my favorite stories have been anywhere from about 65 to 85% SOL, with the other percentages made up of action and conflict. (Possible decades: 60s-90s, modern - Not interested in fantasy or sci-fi for this genre.)\n\nI want to tell a love story above all else. I think most of us do, at the heart of our stories. There are certainly exceptions, but I am not one of them. I am a fiend for a good love story. Star-crossed lovers, etc.\n\nI want to make something that is gritty and real and includes both the good and the bad that comes with a realistic, intense relationship between two people who love each other even when it hurts. I want to include the fights but also the making up. The character development as they grow and change and age, and the ways that can cause friction between two people or even the people around them. The pain and the drama right alongside the joy and happiness. A story about a family. A story sometimes about love, sometimes about loss and grief, sometimes about two people just trying to make it work because they know it's meant to, and they know no matter what they want each other in their life forever. They're family even when they're not together, and because I believe in happy endings, we can rely on the knowledge they belong together even when they're not for certain lengths of time.\n\n**Love. Marriage. Intensity. Loss. Pain. Grief. Children. Family. Loyalty. Betrayal. Dedication. Realism. Mental health issues. Health. Relationships.**\n\nAnd all in between and before and after, drama and love and passion and maybe even dependency on substance and/or people outside of the marriage for one or both of them. I want to go there and get deep into the ways a marriage can both hurt and be amazing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have a couple of main ideas that I want to play off of. Some characters, settings, pairings, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first one is something a little **Mad Men-esque** in that we set it in the early 60s and pair my character, a young woman who is an artist and a free spirit, with a middle-aged man with a wife and two children. Maybe a doctor or professor instead of an ad man though. Don Draper-ish, in the best ways, but not too much because he could be a *real* dog at times. An intense love story that kind of comes out of nowhere and is real and not just for the fun of it. At least not after a while. Maybe at first, but then it's more and it's real and it's painful and beautiful like real love is. I picture my character would be from Montauk, someone he'd meet on vacation, someone unlike anyone he's ever known. Like a breath of fresh air.\n\nThe other, if you're not into something set in the 60s, would be maybe something more modern with an older single father who has full custody of a child from a previous relationship. He'd have a tough relationship with his ex or maybe he's a widower.\n\n**Fiona Gallagher** \\- Keep in mind that this character type can be worked into several different ideas I have, and so is more just the idea for the character and her situation. At any rate - I would like to create a character who is a lot like Fiona in her situation with being responsible for her siblings and household. I'd ideally pair her with a wealthy older guy, or a Jimmy-Steve sort of guy around her age, but without all the dishonesty and secrets. If you haven't watched this show, my idea is also easily explained as it has nothing to do with the actual show and I just want to borrow the overall premise and make it our own. (Possible decades: 60s-present - Not interested in fantasy  or sci-fi for this.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot slice of life but also would consider the following with an **eager** potential partner:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661 RDR/The Revenant/Western US in the mid to late 1800s**  \\- The overall gist is pretty simple, delving into a love story set in the wild west, but I think this could be really fun and amazing if we slapped some good writing on it. We'd be dabbling in some historical fiction, which I love, and using OC's. I mention the specific media examples listed as reference for vibe/setting only, though I am certainly not opposed to borrowing themes from any source. I'd be interested in maybe doing something with a band of outlaws a la RDR2, maybe trappers a la The Revenant. We could eventually have some homesteading, and there's a lot of room for action and drama and slice of life elements all mixed in together, and for some more robust side-characters if we choose to develop them. I'm on my second playthrough of RDR2 and it's so immersive and expansive that I can't help but be inspired and want to reflect that in a story all our own.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese are just rough thoughts about plots and character and any ideas I have listed would need to be developed a lot more, of course, but I truly love that kind of collaborative development of plot and characters, so that's fine by me. I prefer to leave things as more of a loose skeleton without fleshing everything as far as plot and narrative out tooooo much, because I like for the characters to kind of help to illuminate the way as we go. Brainstorming and sharing ideas is great, plotting things to death and down to the very last detail isn't much fun for me though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# \u2661 No matter what kind of world and characters we work in and with, I want a heavy, character-driven, unforgivably human type of story that will ultimately reward us with a beautiful narrative and characters that feel real and alive. Hopefully a friendship and/or writing partnership. Maybe the start of a whole new world we can dabble and play in at our leisure. That's always my hope.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want beauty and heartache and drama and love and yeah, I want a little magic but not in the fantasy sense of the word. I want the magic of two creative, talented minds working together for a common goal and breathing life with words. I want a nice slow to medium-burn of a love story to start out hopefully many lovely stories we can tell together. There are universes to be made.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**If any of this sounds good to you, please don't hesitate to PM me and we can go from there. Most of the above can be worked out.**\n\n# \u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\n\n# Bonus rambling:\n\n\u2661 Usually having the male main character at least a couple of years older than the character I am playing will end up being my vibe. I like to make female characters that challenge and assert against men who might consciously or unconsciously use age as an excuse to dismiss or otherwise silence or stifle them at the beginning, or if they're not the type sometimes also perhaps to use that juxtaposition of age and character for fun because of some of these societally pre-conceived notions, etc.\n\n\u2661 Taking breaks for burnout is totally fine, I will probably take a couple over the course of say, a year, and that's why I prefer having long-term partners. Ditching though, I don't appreciate and try not to do myself. Just let me know, I get it. We're human beings with lives and mental and physical health needs. Or maybe we just aren't meshing? Don't sweat it, just tell me. I will certainly try and do the same.\n\n\u2661 I can get **very** into world, mood and character building and have in the past collaborated on playlists, character references, setting reference, mood boards, etc. with writing partners to help expand on the world based on the mood, using these things as a way to further get on the same page so we can write in both the same tone and from the closest that I think two minds can probably get when working on one world together from two totally different upbringings, sometimes writing styles, background, history, experience, mood, locations in the world, etc. There are a lot of variables, but I feel like discussing characters and setting and vibes and themes you want to include and songs that make you think of a character or a moment or a feeling related to the story and all of that can level some of those variables and bring two people to the same place creatively. It's magic when it happens, and if you've experienced it you know it, and I guess that's what I am looking for again. A little magic, no big deal. Right?\n\n\u2661 I like to tell stories that can sometimes span generations. Maybe even time and space. But most important, stories about families and characters that feel real and who come to life for us. I like having things that I write with long-term writing partners eventually be woven together in some way or another, so that it's a cohesive world, even if in one story we're dabbling in Science Fiction and then in another maybe historical fiction or slice of life or anything in-between. I love doing stuff like that and being collaborative about world-building and borrowing characters and adding generations and ancestors and relatives to families as we go and as the opportunity arises no matter the genre or era we are writing in. I've yet to meet a plot line I can't at least loosely tie together.",

You can play as a neighbour, teacher, store worker, pastor or anyone else you can base a story around. \n\nI have a number of different characters I play or I can play someone new, we can discuss it on Discord. \n\nI enjoy characters who are realistic and detailed. I get a lot of men asking for porn scenes but they are of no interest to me. I don\u2019t have any rules on post length, I think replies can be long or short depending on the situation, for example if two people are talking you might simply type the few words that your character speaks, and other times a large paragraph might be needed to explain something or to move the story along. \n\nI get a lot of men who presume I will want sex with them simply because they tell me I like them, or because they think I will have sex just because I am bored or happen to be in the same place at the same time. I really can\u2019t stress enough that you have to play a character I like in a detailed and realistic way. \n\nIf this interests you message me for my Discord name.",

            "selftext": "So I'm looking for some new RP partners for some fandom roleplay! If any of these interest you, toss me a message and we can talk further. Before I list the fandoms, some basic rules.\n\n1. I only use Discord for RP!\n2. Please, PLEASE be literate. I'm not looking for a Shakespeare, but have some writing experience please!\n3. Match post length if possible. I don't expect novel length replies, but do try to match what I respond with. My post frequency also fluctuates so I may write a ton or very little depending on how the RP goes. Keep that in mind!\n4. Have some knowledge/experience with the fandoms in question. Too many times I end up with partners who are interested in RP who don't know a thing about what I want to RP. It's annoying. Please don't be that person.\n5. Be willing to make a new friend! I love to befriend my RP partners, so you'll get a fun friend to write with too! If you like the occasional silly memes and fangirling we'll get along swimmingly.\n\nNow that those are out of the way, if you've continued to read on - the fandoms I'm looking for are as follows:\n\n1. **Voltron: Legendary Defender - Lotor x OC**. You would be playing Lotor in this scenario. My character is an Altean from Lotor's established colony and discovers that she is gifted with Altean magical ability. Rather than use her for his Quintessence project, he spares her and takes her under his wing to teach her of the culture she has long thought lost to time, and in return provide him with an opportunity to see his people's magic firsthand. A bond soon forms between the two...\n2. **Final Fantasy XV - Ardyn x OC**. You would be playing Ardyn in this scenario. A former member of the Kingsglaive is captured during the attack on Insomnia and ends up in the clutches of Chancellor Ardyn. Rather than kill her, he chooses instead to spare her life, considering the idea that having a Kingsglaive of his own may not be such a bad idea...\n3. **Kingdom Hearts - Axel/Lea x OC.** You would be playing as Axel/Lea in this scenario. Both former members of Organization XIII returned to life, they went on separate paths. Lea turned to the side of Light, becoming a Keyblade master, and an old friend remained steeped in the shadows. His first task as a Keyblade master? To find her and set her free.\n4. **Nier Automata - 2B x 9S.** You would be playing 9S in this scenario. This is the only one in which it would be Canon x Canon rather than a Canon x OC relationship. 2B and 9S survived the aftermath of the battle against Adam, Eve, and the twisted creations of the Tower. Now left without a purpose or a place to call home, they must explore what remains of Earth in search of what to do and where to go next. As it turns out humanity may not be as entirely gone as they suspect.\n5. **Destiny/Destiny 2 - Cayde-6 x OC.** You would be playing Cayde-6 in this scenario. The ever-snarky and ever a loner Cayde-6 quickly begins to realize he's got feelings towards one of his best Hunters... and that she cares for him in turn. When the two are called in to stop a riot at the Prison of Elders, things take a turn and the two of them must make decisions that could change the course of their world as they know it. Takes place during/after the events of Forsaken, with Cayde surviving the Prison of Elders instead of well, y'know.\n6. **Final Fantasy XIV - Crystal Exarch x Warrior of Light.** For this one you would be playing the Crystal Exarch against my female Warrior of Light. The pressures of having to save the world again and again take its toll, even when the world isn't the one she's used to... but even the Warrior of Light, she who is chosen by Hydaelyn deserves to have someone to turn to in times of need. Thus she goes to the one person who can truly understand her plight. \n\nI have other fandoms that I enjoy as well, but those directly listed above are the roleplay concepts that I'm seeking to fulfill at this time. My timezone is EST. If you've read this far and are interested, toss me a message and we can discuss further!",

            "selftext": "Strong World is a role-play and gaming server that mostly focuses on its primary role-play, A World of Ice and Fire. It is a T-1, text-based RP based off of George R.R Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire, or what most people commonly know it through the show Game of Thrones. It operates off of both Fandom and imvu, one for storing all information relevant to the RP and the other a social platform that the RP will actually occur on.\n\nStrong World's A World of Ice and Fire is a T-1 role-play based off of George R.R Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire books. Unlike the actual series itself, Strong World's AWIF RP takes place within an alternative timeline. This divergence takes place after 200 A.C, following shortly after the first Blackfyre Rebellion. Since then, there are a few changes that have altered the face of Westeros. For one, the first Blackfyre Rebellion ended so terribly that the remaining Blackfyre supporters scoured to the far reaches of the world to hide from their victors. As well as this, the Spring Sickness that devastated Westeros in the early 200's never came, meaning that the Targaryen bloodline wasn't nearly as devastated as it was because of this event.\n\nThe story takes place at the beginning 299 A.C, in the late reign of the ill Aerius I. The queen-mother, Meria, has progressively become ill and rests on her death bed. Yet all is not well, peace has reigned for nearly a century but what has kept this peace? What secrets have been hidden from the world for the sake of the realm?\n\n-This group features multiple dedicated Dungeon Masters, an open world setting as well as a character-driven plot faced, at times, with preordained events. \n\nhttps://discord.gg/jvK48cv  Join our Discord server to learn more and start roleplaying!",

I prefer to play female in MxF pairings, just for reference! Other than that I'm fine with MxM and Fxf as well. \n\nAs for Roleplay style, I ask that you aren't a complete newbie and that you have the ability to write at least 5 paragraphs. Not all the time, of course. 5+ paragraphs aren't always necessary. I also ask that you either have a character ready or that you're willing to make a fairly detailed one for the RP. I love a character that's well thought out and well rounded. Please also have at least readable grammar. \n\nI'm more than happy to think up a plot with you, but I shouldn't have to be the only one thinking it up. Just constantly saying \"it's up to you\" doesn't really give me much to work with. In any case, please message me with at least a slight idea of a character or plot you'd like to try. \n\nALSO!

The setting is modern day, it\u2019s the middle of July and my family and I are on vacation, it was in celebration for my graduation. I am originally from Charlotte North Carolina but we were visiting Sweden for two weeks. We had been here a week when we were out hiking, I had met a group of men who invited me to a party that was happening that Friday. They gave me an address and convinced me I had to go to a party while visiting Sweden. That Friday night I go to the party and meet up with these men, I was having a fun night until I started to feel numb. It was too late before I realized I couldn\u2019t feel anything, slouched over in the booth of this bar the guys carry me out and into a car. They throw me in the back seat but only one gets in the car, that\u2019s you. You start the car and look back at me. I can\u2019t say a word or even more, your face is all I see before passing out./ If that\u2019s something you\u2019re interested in I\u2019d love to discuss kinks and limits. Before you disregard this as some forced  role, it doesn\u2019t have to be forceful after the abduction. Im very much looking for someone to play an older male who wanted this young American girl and I want to play a girl who loves her kidnapper.    That\u2019s the idea. A character description will come later if you decide you\u2019re interested.",

            "selftext": "Hello! I go by Jam, and I\u2019m a longtime RPer that\u2019s still looking for another like-minded creative individual. Through Reddit I luckily found an amazing writer that meshed well with me, and now I'm -still- looking for one more. I have gotten quite a few responses in the past that might not have panned out, so if you answered before, please don't be afraid to do so again.\n\nOver the years I\u2019ve had the pleasure of writing with a plethora of people, in just about every genre imaginable. I\u2019ve cultivated friendships with them outside of writing that\u2019s led to some of the best RP\u2019s that have spanned years. So, when I look for a partner, I\u2019m looking for someone who wants something long-term, enjoys world building, character development, and story development before writing and through the RP itself. Hopefully you share those same values.\n\nI\u2019m primarily a novella style poster (Three paragraphs or more), but I also take into account what\u2019s going on in the story, as well as my partner\u2019s style. Quantity is certainly not everything. I do my best to make sure spelling, punctuation, and grammar are absolutely basic (What good is RP if you can\u2019t understand what I\u2019m typing?), so you should as well. I admit though, I have a love/hate relationship with commas. I\u2019m not really open to Discord since it\u2019s not really user friendly for me in terms of writing. I'm also in the process of creating my own personal anonymous board for myself and my partners. We can talk about this.\n\nAs the title suggests, I\u2019m looking for RP set in one of the genres mentioned below (I'm open to your ideas as well). Original characters preferred. From there we can begin plotting things like world building, characters, character histories, background, and storytelling. Honestly, I can't state enough that this process is a favorite for me. I want to share the story, not run it. You shouldn\u2019t want to do so either. The flow should be automatic and the equilibrium between push/pull of events by writers should be balanced. I\u2019m an adult (Please be 21+), so please expect mature themes.\n\nScience Fiction - Looking for something based in the world of Aeon Trinity. I've created an easy site for information of the world that can be used. Or we can create anew!\n\nPost Apocalyptic or Survival w/ a hint of science fiction - Perhaps something based on the Doom novels. War of the Worlds is another possibility as well.\n\nStar Wars - It\u2019s Star Wars, not much more needs to be said. I tend to enjoy writing after major plots have happened. After episode 3 or after episode 6, and beyond.\n\nMedieval Fantasy - Might require a bit of world building, but I have some of that info from past writings if we choose to use it. This might be my #1 genre to explore at the moment, but we'll see.\n\nModern Fantasy - The 5th Age in Tolkien lore? Yes please. Think of the movie Bright on Netflix.\n\nThis is just a bit of what's on my mind to write. Again, if you have any suggestions, I'll be open to them. So if you made it this far, thanks for reading.

            "selftext": "I met you on a dating site. You seemed sweet, liked music and film, animals, even seemed active in some important causes. I was impressed, and sent you a message. I was worried that my being trans would turn you away, or have you fetishize me, but you seemed receptive, like it was a fact about me, not my whole story. I admit, maybe my standards are low due to past experience... but I really like you, and I\u2019m really looking forward to our date this Saturday.\n\nIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve even had to be in the dating scene: after a hard break-up, I\u2019ve been alone for a while, sought out random, disconnected flings, but I want something real again. Maybe you\u2019re the guy who can give me a romance I\u2019ve wanted ever since I was a little kid: to be seen as the pretty girl in front of you, just like any other girl, but also to be seen for who I am beneath everything.\n\u2014-\nHi all! First post on this sub, been wanting to branch out from the endless smut I get into on DPP into something sweet and real. This is meant to be a roleplay in which two characters find genuine love with one another, as imperfect, flawed people with their own motivations and story. \n\nI\u2019m looking for a literate, creative, trans-positive partner to make this a reality, and I am looking for real, fleshed out characters, not tropes or stereotypes. No chasers or transphobes need apply, obviously, though I don\u2019t know why the latter group would. In-character left-wing sympathies preferred but not required\u2014this is the type of character who would take a date to a protest rally, but her date could also be a supportive presence she comes home to.\n\nThis is primarily a romantic, SFW plot at first, but there will be explicit love scenes eventually as well. Message me to talk characters and build this world together.\n\nThank you!",

            "selftext": "Hello :)\n\nThank you for looking at my post. Here is a short rundown of what I am planing for the play. It you have any questions regarding that play feel free to ask :)\n\nPlot: The basic plot idea is that your character is born with the ability to turn into black smoke for a few seconds, allowing you to slip through a keyhole or become almost invisible in the dark. An ability like that is something special even for this world where magic is a rather common thing. This has made you a social outcast. But now you have heard about a group of people who have the same rare ability. Your goal now is to find that group and finally learn more about who you are.\n\nMe and myself: I am your humble GM, trying to provide an interesting world for your interesting character! I try to leave you as much freedom for your creativity as possible within the rules of the world and the general direction of the story. \n\nAs for my person: I am 25, male and from Germany, usually find the time to respond frequently (exceptions possible) and would prefer if we played on discord.\n\nYou and your character: Must be 18 or older. Should speak somewhat decent English (Decent, not perfect) and enjoy creativity. \n\nThank you for reading through all of this, I hope you have a nice day!",

With the sudden appearance of an antiquated archway, carved from marble with massive, similarly carved doors, chaos has erupted in the middle of New York City.\n\nAs the marble doors swing open and admit Roman legionnaires on foot and on horse, Orcs, Goblins, even Dragons into the streets of a modern day New York, police are dispatched to the scene, not believing what they're hearing. Events quickly spiral out of control as even armed police, SWAT, and finally the National Guard deploy to handle the throngs of otherworldly fantasy creatures pouring out of the gate.\n\nThe streets run red with the blood of combatants and civilians alike before, finally, heavy armor in the form of Abrams Main Battle Tanks and Helicopter Gunships arrived to stem the tide with firepower that not even dragons could hope to match.\n\nAttacking forces retreated through the gate, leaving dozens of survivors and hundreds more dead behind. US Army infantry forces and military police moved rapidly to capture whoever they could and provide medical to civilians affected by the attack.\n\nNow, a month after the attack, a military checkpoint has sprung up surrounding the gate, with an armed force constantly on alert in case another force comes through the since-closed doors. With the population up in arms and baying for blood, congress has given permission to expeditionary detachments and the orders to set up a Forward Operating Base on the other side, to find out who and what decided to make one of the worst attacks on American soil since 9/11, 20 years ago.\n\nOrders have been going out all across the stateside combat commands, with forces being brought up to full readiness in case of any number of snowballing scenarios. Several Navy SEAL and Delta Force teams have been sent in already, and a full brigade of infantry and armor have followed and built the beginnings of a base on the other side. With a base to operate from and the other side of the gate secured against attack, JSOC has cut orders for a marksman team to enter and begin recon operations alongside conventional forces and the initial commando teams.\n\nAmerica has been scorned, wounded, and enraged by fantastical creatures. Now? You return the favor.\n\n-----\n\nHello! Thanks for reading with me so far! I've been itching to do a roleplay in the GATE universe.\n\nInitially, it takes place in Japan, with basically the same premise. Gate opens up, fighting breaks out in the streets, and then after everything gets calmed down, an ad-hoc combat command is gathered up and sent through to build a base and gain a foothold in this new world with a hearts and minds approach.\n\nNow, America, being the hearts and minds professionals (Not so much, admittedly), is being forced to ramp up their readiness after two decades of continuous war in the Middle East. Their army is tired of war, despite the macho chest beating, but the same type of attack that took them to the Sandbox is now taking them to a land untouched by modern technology and civilization, standing nearly two millennia in the past and filled with fantastical wonders.\n\nAs I said at the end of the prompt, this will be a two person sniper-spotter configuration built for deep recon and gaining intelligence, later on transitioning to something else that I've yet to decide given I like to play by the seat of my pants. It'll go back and forth between \"Field\" portions, where you're out lugging around a backpack and gear and doming people who need it, and \"Base\" portions, where it's time for R&amp;R and to de-stress.\n\nI'm willing to toy with the ideas and change things up if need be, but I also want to maintain the initial ideas as much as I can. Given the post length, I tend to write a lot, about two to five paragraphs on average, and I'm available often. I also like making friends with my partners so please be ready for ooc chat, because I can't stand the feeling of writing against a brick wall.\n\nIf you're interested, message me and we'll see where things go!",

My timezone is EDT.\n\nOriginal Ideas will be before the Fandom ones (that doesn't mean I prefer OG), but here's some rules first.\n\n1: I'm Bi, so either gender will work for anything unless otherwise stated, and I don't mind if you play the opposite gender. MxM and FxF are perfectly fine.\n\n2: After we start, do not ghost me, please! If you want to stop, just tell me instead of leaving me wondering.\n\n3: Some of these require NPC's from time to time, so if you're fine with playing a few characters at some points, that'd be great! But if you aren't, that's fine too!\n\n4: Start a Reddit Convo and I'll give you my discord! I'd like to go off Reddit dm's quickly since they're a bit hard to work with.\n\n6: All my ideas will be on a scale from 1-10, depending on how much I'd like to do it. 1 is a \"If you want\" and 10 is a \"Want to do now\" but if you want to do one with a lower score, that's fine!\n\n7: I tend to 'dip' in and out of rping, occasionally. I get busy sometimes. but I will come back!\n\nAlright! Now that that's out of the way, here are my ideas!\n\n--OG--\n\n[4/10] Person X A.I.\n\nSomeone finds a broken storage device somewhere, and after fixing it discovers an A.I. so advanced it acts just like a person.\n\n[7/10] Trans M2F X Person\n\nA recently-transitioned girl begins dating someone, making them feel more at ease about everything.\n\n[6/10] Human X Ghost\n\nSomeone who can see ghosts always found them annoying, always wanting to \"get revenge\" and the like, moves to a small, but growing city and meets the one ghost there that only wants one thing: someone to talk to.\n\n[4/10] Guy in a Girl's school\n\nA boy's life had been rather hectic. He had been forced to move frequently, making staying in one school rather... difficult. Now, that has changed; He was accepted at a boarding school. But as he arrived, he realised a major mistake: it was an all-girls school! With nowhere to go, the principal suggest a strange idea: him disguising as a girl and attending the school.\n\n[4/10] Invisible person\n\nOne day, someone woke up with a strange predicament: nobody could see or hear them! months later, they were walking through a crowd of people when they someone bumped them to the ground, to which they were used to. The thing they weren't used to, however, is the person trying to help them up. They could see them?!\n\n[4/10] A one-night stand! ...Or maybe more..?\n\nTwo college students wake up after a party... in the same bed, with no memory of the last night, and no idea who each other are. But as they spend more time together, do they realize their feelings?\n\n[8/10] We're each other?!\n\nTwo roommates, pretty close to each other, one day wake up in each others bodies! Now, as they learn more about one another, they grow closer than ever...\n(Would prefer a M/F pairing, to make the story more interesting)\n--Fandom!--\n\nMy Hero Academia\n[4/10] Hero Toga X anyone\n\nToga becomes (for lack of a better term) normal, and joins U.A. for protection against the league. Someone from Class A helps her through this stressful time.\n\n[5/10] Female Midoriya X Anyone (except Bakugo)\n\nOne day during basic patrol, Midoriya was hit with a quirk that turned him into a girl! He needs some help coping with this... change.\n\n[4/10] Mina X Jirou, Momo, Ochaco, or Midoriya\n\n[6/10] OC/Next-Gen OC X Anyone/OC/Next-Gen OC\n\n\nMob Psycho 100\n[6/10] Shigeo X OC\n\nA new student has joined Mob's class, and this new student happens to be psychic.\n\nJojo's Bizarre Adventure\n[4/10] User X Stand\n\nA person suddenly gains a stand, one with free will.\n\n----\n\nAgain, DM me if your interested.

My most detailed and exciting (at least to me) idea involves Kylo Ren/Ben Solo. I'd like a bit of a slow burn romance, could be forbidden or not - I love clich\u00e9s.

            "selftext": "Hello everyone! After quite a bit of a hiatus I\u2019m looking for some new rps! I've been roleplaying for about 7-8 years now and am familiar with all types. My responses are typically shorter and I usually don't go over 2-3 paragraphs unless I feel the situation calls for more detail. This is largely because I rapid fire roleplay instead of saving it all for one or two responses a day. However, I do try to match the responses of my partner.\n\nI love love love a good romance rp. I don't mind doing rps without romance, but I'm generally not as good as those. I typically like to explore some heavier/more sensual themes, so because of that I need you to be 18+.\n\nI\u2019m 23 years old and in college/working so I\u2019ll have periods of time where I can\u2019t answer and may not be able to warn you that I\u2019m dropping off. I\u2019m looking for more long term partner that is also willing to do some OOC chat, though that isn\u2019t required. I want this to be a rp built by both of us, so please come to me with some ideas of at least some starting points. No \u201cIt\u2019s fine whatever you want!\u201d please, that gets old fast.\n\n\nOnto genres! I'll pretty much do any genre, but here are my favorites:\n\n * sci-fi\n\n * fantasy\n\n * post-apocalypse\n\n * dystopian\n\nAnd for those of you who like fandoms:\n\n * Avengers (movies)\n\n * Harry Potter\n\n * Clan of the Cavebear series\n\n * Sword of Truth series\n\nIf you made it this far, congratulations! Have a cookie! I hope to hear from some of yall soon :)",

We are **one** muse per mun, no duplicates, and are looking to fill out the roster! There are two mods that are active, involved, and responsive.\n\nWe are *canon compliant* (with flexibility), have an official accurate-as-possible timeline, and periodic in-server events. We allow applications for canon characters, background NPCs (given you've put enough thought and work into the character to flesh them out and have ideas for how they'll interact with the broader server), and OCs at our personal discretion, though as a fair warning we are stricter on OCs and require more information to ensure they'll fit within the story and environment.\n\n**Please note that we will ask in-depth questions about your characterization after you send the app.** This is not only to ensure we have a good understanding of your character/characterization, but to ensure that you have reasoning for certain things like non-canon or unconfirmed events you want added. Because there are no duplicates, we want to ensure stories mesh well.\n\nThis server is inclusive, and we do **not** tolerate bigotry, homophobia, transphobia, or any other form of hate.\n\nPlease DM me with the character you wish to apply for, either canon or OC, and I'll send you the app along with both mod discord names. You can send the app to either one. **Google docs not accepted.**\n\n**TAKEN CHARACTERS:**\n\n* Ana \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0 **\u2022** \u00a0 \u00a0Genji \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0    **\u2022** \u00a0 \u00a0Hanzo\n* Junkrat \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  \u00a0    **\u2022** \u00a0 \u00a0L\u00facio \u00a0 \u00a0  \u00a0    \u00a0 \u00a0    **\u2022** \u00a0 \u00a0Cabaret Luna\n* Maximilien    \u00a0  \u00a0**\u2022** \u00a0 \u00a0McCree       \u00a0 \u00a0    **\u2022** \u00a0 \u00a0Mercy\n* Moira  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  \u00a0    \u00a0**\u2022** \u00a0 \u00a0Pharah               **\u2022** \u00a0 \u00a0Reaper\n* Reinhardt         \u00a0**\u2022** \u00a0 \u00a0Soldier: 76    \u00a0    **\u2022** \u00a0 \u00a0Sombra\n* T\u00f6rbjorn           \u00a0**\u2022** \u00a0 \u00a0Tracer               \u00a0 **\u2022** \u00a0 \u00a0Widowmaker\n* Winston            \u00a0**\u2022** \u00a0 \u00a0Zenyatta",

I think that in a movie  you'd be backlit by cityscape but standing in or walking out of a quiet  side street. Smoke would billow out from your mouth in trails behind  you, hazily coloured by lights in the distance. You have a car that you  love, a motorbike you love more.

You drink spirits out of short glasses  with those perfectly chiselled ice cubes.\n\nHell, you're probably an asshole too, not even that deep down either. But here we are.\n\n*Check  my other posts for a bit of what I'm about, particularly \"Neon  Dreaming\". If this gig catches your fancy, we can get to setting up and  writing and all that jazz... See you round.*",
