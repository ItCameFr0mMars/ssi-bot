            "selftext": "Good evening there folks! In the past week or so, and with some help, I've gotten myself re-familiarized with the ins and outs of being at least a decent DM! Though, I find myself still seeking a few more partners to create stories with, and was hoping that some of you would be willing to tag along with me for another adventure!\n\nThat being said, I'm also more than happy to do some 1x1 stories, with either of us controlling the aspects of the world as we go!\n\nI'm more than happy to spin a tale on any of your favorite genres, though the ones that I tend to specialize in, or are at least most experienced in, are fantasy and apocalyptic themes! Still, I hope that doesn't discourage you from pitching anything else! I'm more than happy to work with anyone in order to make a world together that we can both enjoy, as well as any story!\n\nIn addition, here are some fandoms that I'd be **stoked** for us to play in:\n\n- Fallout series \n- TES series\n- Red Dead Redemption (Yeehaw!)***\n- Fable series\n- Gears\n- Kingdom Come\n- The Last of Us (Or any zombie related game, really) \n- Metro series\n- Rainbow 6 or For Honor (interested to see how either of these might go.\n- Many more!\n\nOr just some regular settings/genres:\n\n- 1800's Western\n- Fantasy (Anything from high fantasy to medieval and Roman era settings)\n- Some kinda of military operations group/ team (Call me biased, would really like one like this.)\n- Post Apocalyptic\n- Horror\n- Many More!\n\nOf course, I'm also open to \"borrowing\" the world of whatever your favorite fandom might be, with some sparse exceptions! Video games, books, movies, etc, just let me know and we'll see what we can do!\n\nAs for my preferences on things, I prefer my partner be mostly literate, (I'm not perfect either, of course! Just someone that grasp things well enough!) Over the age of 18, and understanding of schedules! I'll never be on to get upset if you have to go all of the sudden, though if you feel the need to cut things off, please let me know! \n\nMy only other stipulation is that you please be willing to work with me. I understand, it's my job as a GM to come up with the world, but it's really hard to do so when my partner isn't willing to put the same effort into things! If we feel that things are bland/ dying, then I'm happy to work with things to revitalize it, or even drop it.\n\nLast topic to cover, I believe, is the possibility of smut occuring in the story! As stated above, I'm pretty familiar with it, and are totally fine with doing it at any level that you're comfortable with, or not at all! If need be, we can discuss those preferences, likes/ dislikes, etc later on!\n\nIf this interests you, please don't hesitate to shoot me a message! I'm taking on about as many as I can handle without sacrificing any attention to any of my potential partners!\n\nPlease, have a great day!\n\nAlso, if you've reached out to me before and I disappeared or didn't respond, please feel free to hit me up again! I had bit of a debacle with my Discord and Reddit as of recent.",

I wanted to present this idea, as I have not been roleplaying lately because of school, and drama I\u2019ve been tangled up in (as well as people, toxic people at that). \n\nThat being said, I love having roleplay partners. Whether this turns into a longterm partnership, or friendship, I want you to message anyways to see where it goes. It\u2019s an escape, I love writing. My two favorite scenarios are the \u201cmommy\u201d or \u201cdaddy\u201d role. Of course, if you do not enjoy this, we can always do something else, I am very flexible, and I have a few more ideas in mind. :) \n\nIf you know you\u2019re used to ghosting or leaving because the roleplay does not go the way you want, do not bother messaging. I like to be upfront and I tend voice my opinion if I don\u2019t enjoy something, you can do the same. I\u2019m a hopeless romantic and would love to incorporate that into the rp. \u2665 \n\n \n\nI\u2019ll list my likes once dislikes once we talk on a different platform. I\u2019m really looking forward to roleplaying with you.",

I have multiple, all what I consider smugglers (though one is a borderline bounty hunter), but the main character that would be of focus here would be a female smuggler of mine. They\u2019re a package, and you can\u2019t have one without the other! Come at me with any canon character from any movie, or even an original character of yours! My most detailed and exciting (at least to me) idea involves Kylo Ren/Ben Solo. I am completely caught up on the latest film, so if you\u2019d like to talk spoilers, let me know, otherwise I won\u2019t mention it! I'd like a bit of a slow burn romance, could be forbidden or not - I love clich\u00e9s. This can include NSFW as well, if you\u2019d like. I\u2019m up for almost anything! My main focus is character development!\n\n* Must be 18+ (both character and OOC) as I am an adult and do not feel comfortable rping this with any minors.\n* I write normally 3+ paragraphs, but I am okay with *at least* 2 paragraph responses.\n* I write strictly in 3rd person and ask that you do the same.\n* Very important: Do not bombard me for replies. I have a life outside of rp, and if you are constantly messaging me about replying after only a day or two, I will end the chat.\n\nPM me if you're interested, and we can discuss this over on discord!

As we approach the body to investigate it vanishes in a black mist.\n\nConfused and dumbfounded we go to report the deed, only to find the deceased party alive and well, leading to further confusion.\n\nSo this first plot is a nice little conspiracy, shapeshifters are invading and taking over positions of power, this will lead to us trying to uncover and the plot before the shapeshifters take over.\n\nMany years ago the world was ruled by the demon king Satanael along with his seven deadly sins and demon armies. The only thing that managed to stop his iron tight grasp was the combined forces of ten great wizards who managed to seal away the demon king and his underlings, however this came at a great price for the wizards, they each sacrificed their bodies becoming keys for the seal which holds the demons.\n\nWe now jump forward in time, worshippers of the demon king have began to gather the 10 keys, having four within the grasp, they plan to release Satanael and have him rule once again.\n\nNow in this prompt we would ether play as the king\u2019s elite squad, sent out only on the most dangerous of missions or a group of adventurers coming across the plot and feeling a need to stop the resurrection of the demon king.\n\nThe third and final prompt involves us playing as already existing adventures who have suffered their most devastating defeat, this leads to us being sold off to some foreign island where we work as prisoners trying to find some way to escape the island and captivity.\n\nSo those are my prompts.\n\nNow what do I expect from you? Well not too much actually, all I ask is you be enthusiastic and for your post length, just give me something to work with, that\u2019s all. \n\nI enjoy using 3rd person however I am always fine with playing in the 1st.\n\nI\u2019ll mention once again I\u2019m not married to these ideas. I hope at least one of them has tickled your fancy, so please just send me a message, I\u2019m friendly and don\u2019t bite :)",

            "selftext": "Hi! I\u2019m 27, male, in Seattle, looking for a new partner to RP with! \n\nI\u2019m looking to play a romance, with a good splash of drama, and am very open to going for a different theme to make it not like every other roleplay theme out there. I love the brainstorming and world building process and oh, and I only RP on discord. \n\nI\u2019ve just noticed over the years that if I\u2019m not able to joke, talk, get excited about the roleplay and discuss life with my RP partner it just doesn\u2019t have the longevity that we all are looking for. With that in mind, I\u2019m looking for someone who embraces OOC, and understands that  the relationship is integral to the RP. I would like to first become friends and then start the RP if that\u2019s okay.\n\nA little about me: I\u2019m a (mental health) therapist, enjoy running, going to the gym, and reading a good amount (philosophy, psychology, fiction), and my job can be stressful, and need the escape that RP gives. I love laughing (not sure who doesn\u2019t though) and love writing as well!\n\nI\u2019m a pretty easy going guy, but I have my things I\u2019m really passionate about. I\u2019m not a gamer, so don\u2019t expect me to understand gamer references :p\n\nA have a few broad plot ideas for us to build upon \u2014 but I\u2019m also really open to hearing yours as well!\n\nIm detailed (2-6 paragraphs depending on context), I\u2019m literate, and love smiling when I see a notification from my dream partner. I\u2019m looking for someone ideally 22+, to write in 3rd person, and to have more than a year of experience. I\u2019m really not super strict on these guidelines, but they are definitely guidelines of sorts\n\nSend me a message with a little about you and your discord and we can go from there :)",

My time remains limited but I am on break for a while, so I can get to planning something meaningful once more.  I'm 27 years old, with around 10 years of experience, so I will only write with those above 21, preferably 25+.  OOC discussion is very important, simply because I have a very jumpy Muse and am prone to 5 different ideas and plots a day. Word counts and character sheets are not a necessity, but I\\\\d love it if some thought and insight could go into writing and will promise to strive for that myself.  \n\n\n**Adult women are what I am looking to play at the moment, in MxF relationships.** Romance and Drama are vital for me, as moving, evolving character studies of some sort. I am not interested in Anime or Furry.  \n\n\n**Craving a plot set within the universe of  A Song of Ice and Fire/Game of Thrones. I can play both original and established characters and I'd love it if you did too.**   \n\n\nPM me for a list of potential pairings and plots and thanks for reading!",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone! Recently ive been thinking alot about my intro to Islamic history class, as i learned alot of cool stuff about the near east. I wanted to do a roleplay set in the middle east or in a middle eastern like fictional world, a land dominated by deserts, oases, and survival of the fittest tribal ideology. I loved learning about the differences between nomadic and urban tribes, about the Christian and Jewish as well as Muslim tribes... I want to do a roleplay about a woman who rises to power on such a region and builds a magnificent empire, whether it be based on war or tolerance.\n\nI usually rp on discord. Should you be interested know that I use a character census to keep track of everyone, a history and culture channel where i can throw interesting world building facts and trivia at you, and a discussion channel for out of rp talk. Please have a reference pic ready and please please dont be intimidated! This roleplay is one that i promise you will enjoy should you love world building, drama, and history.\n\nDm me if interested! Hope to hear from you soon!",

If you dont know what bimbofication is then I can definitely help you learn about the kink ahead of time. But do know ahead of time that this is definitely very NSFW. I have a few scenarios ready to go but just wanted to see if there is any general interest first. \n\nFeel free to send me a message or chat here and I'd be happy to share my kik after that.\n\nThanks!\n\n-D",

Scarred during  the gruesome war and avoiding total destruction  altogether, Angels,  humans, and demons manage to enter into a truce...  But after 1,000  years of fragile and forged peace in Heavengard...  The lengthy peace  eventually led the humans to forget their memories of  the scars and  hardship from the war. As they forgot faults of the past,  selfishness,  corruption, and arrogance slowly spread throughout the  land...   Finally, the balance of peace broke and strange occurrences started   happening. There came a strange howl from the boundaries that divided   Angels, humans, and demons. Peaceful creatures became aggressive and   attacked innocent villagers. Violent earthquakes ripped whole continents   apart. Great hail storms drove some species to the brink of   extinction...  The mysterious legend of demons were rediscovered...  As  the fragile peace began to fall apart, stories about the parts of   Symphony protecting the peace began to spread among the adventurers.   Forgetting the true nature of the ancient relics, people set out to seek   the pieces out of selfishness and the promise of wealth that would  come  with it...\n\nAll adventure are welcome!! lets defeat the demon king!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://discord.gg/NhGGTM](https://discord.gg/NhGGTM)",

            "selftext": "Hi there! My name is Bailey and I\u2019m in need of some new partners, as I am always trying to expand. I use kik, discord, or reddit for my roleplay. As for what I\u2019m looking for, I\u2019m not clear on what I\u2019m looking for plot-wise, but I can tell you this: \n\nI love romance, and it\u2019s a definite must, whether it\u2019s FxF or MxF, and I always play female. I\u2019m into drama, action, dark themes, supernatural, slice of life, horror, adventure, and pretty much all of the above. My imagination has troubles when it comes to fantasy and magic, though. \n\nI\u2019m pretty much willing to do any genre or plots that you may have, and if neither of us have a fleshed out idea it\u2019s always fun to create one together and continue creating together as we go along! \n\nLet me also mention this: I\u2019m not looking for a sex-based roleplay, but enjoy including it into the story as it fits, with an appropriate build. \n\nMy preference for style is 1st person, but I can do 3rd as well. I don\u2019t care about post length, and think a paragraph is just fine. I cannot find 2+ paragraphs fun, as I feel like it hinders the partners\u2019 abilities to move the story along. It\u2019s just easier to bounce off of replies when they\u2019re shorter, especially with dialogue. \n\nIf you have any prompts, plots, or ideas you\u2019d like to discuss or roleplay, send me a message so we can get to creating something together. I hope you took time to read this, I tried to keep it short, so if you have any further comments/questions, message me! Thanks, Bailey.",

After giving a sigh of relief, she stood, and cupped her hands over her mouth. \"All fixed Captain!\" She yelled, glad to be leaving this backwater system. Triah adjusted her overalls, the tight material snagging on her toolkit. She took unclipped one strap, the dirty garment now hanging from one shoulder, the white tank top underneath now visible.\n\nIt's not that Triah didn't like the Outer Rim, after all, they got the majority of their jobs from Hutts (or at least those who spoke for the gangsters, she had never actually laid eyes upon those hideous creatures.) and she had grown up on Kessel. She just preferred to keep moving, never letting anyone who may be after them catch up. There had already been a few close calls in this sector, and she just wanted to go.\n\nThe pair of them were now thick as thieves, getting jobs smuggling and transporting all over hutt space. She had joined up with her captain mere days after turning 18, eager to explore the galaxy and prove herself. They had actually come to this region for some rest and relaxation, but this vacation had become quite the opposite. It turns out the imperials really don't like it when you break the law, or their laws at least. So they had been running, as usual.\n\nThe woman wandered back up to the cockpit, a short walk in the relatively small ship, and lent against the doorway, grinning at the person piloting the ship. \"So, where are we headed next?\" She asked, a smirk on her lips and an eyebrow arched.\n\n\\----------------------------\n\nHey there! I'd love to play out some stories in the Galaxy far, far away. Triah is one of my original characters, but I'm happy to make others to better fit the story. **I will not play with canon characters.** I'm happy to play in any time period with any setting, as long as we're both excited about it!\n\nI'm looking for other people with detailed knowledge of the Star Wars universe and literate writing skills. I've been RPing on many different platforms with different partners for over 4 years now, and I'll do my best to answer everyone interested! I'm on GMT, so should be around for the rest of the afternoon.\n\nPlease come along with a character idea and one for a scene/setting. I enjoy brainstorming, but I don't want people who have no idea what to do.\n\nIf you are interested, please DM me your Discord tag as chatting there is much easier than Reddit. Hope to hear from you soon!",

            "selftext": "I\u2019m back again with another original idea, one I dug up from an old RP I used many moons ago. This one is set in Medieval times, with variation between mid to high fantasy. I\u2019m leaving the information below to basic starter info for two reasons: plot and world building. I want both of us to collaborate on something we can both enjoy. Now to the fun part.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**Reapers.** They train their whole life to become a Reaper, only to risk it all fighting the plague. Seeing a Reaper is considered to be a bad omen. They say it signifies the plague is coming. They are noticeable by their dark-as-midnight horses, black hoods, and white symbols etched into their hoods. However, their most recognizable feature is the large scythe they carry around. \n\n**The Plague.** It started to appear roughly ten years ago. It spreads through nature like a creeping flame. Instead of burning whatever it touches, it consumes them in unholy darkness. Anything it touches rots, decays, withers, or becomes a husk of it\u2019s former self. It corrupts the mind of anything living, only beings with a strong willpower can withstand it but only for so long. Living creatures are turned into unholy beasts once their will is broken. This has caused widespread panic and unease throughout the continent as the Reapers help try to contain it.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nIt\u2019s not a whole lot, but it\u2019s a start that allows us to build upon. It will have a dark and gritty tone to it. My character will be one of the Reapers, as for yours there\u2019s plenty of possibilities. I\u2019ll leave your imagination to that one!\n\nNow, for some information about me: \n\n- 21 Male\n- CST. Usually awake later in the night (4-6 am) \nUsually asleep around 6am-2pm. This varies, but is generally correct.\n- Work late afternoon (around 3pm-10:30pm) 5 days a week, but can reply sometimes during work. (I work retail, so for another few weeks I\u2019ll be extra busy)\n- Reply length varies. Usually 3+ paragraphs if my partner is detailing their responses and I\u2019m enjoying the plot.\n- Enjoys romance if it\u2019s built up. NSFW themes are open, but they can\u2019t be the focus and have to make sense.\n\nNow what I\u2019m looking for in my partner:\n\n- 18+ \n- World building, obviously, and enjoys adding their own ideas to the role play.\n- I would prefer having someone who could reply multiple times a day (I have a few partners right now who reply once a day), but it\u2019s not necessary. \n- Life happens, if you can let me know if you\u2019ll be away/busy that\u2019s awesome! If not, I\u2019m patient so don\u2019t worry. \n- Detailed enough in their responses, with normally a 2+ paragraph length.",

You must be OK with Incest as kink and Fantasy Genre (you don\u2019t need to be an expert in fantasy). You need to be an experienced or at least a detailed RPer. Good grammar is essential.  Replies length may be from 4+ PC lines to a couple/several paragraphs.     \n\n\nPrompt: A fantasy kingdom ruled by us (The whole group) a royal family. It will be a debauchery kingdom.   \n\n\nI am looking for a Mom (Regent Queen), a sister, and a brother players. Females (cis or trans) will play as Females or Futas. Males as Male or Futa. One of the players (A member of the family, or maybe we add another player) will also be the High Priest (Priestess) of the Church of Our Goddess the Lady of Lust the Succubi Queen.  \n\n\nI'm trying to do this with few people at first, 4 (counting me), up to 6 if we come up with ideas for another interesting characters for the story. In any case I can serve as GM for NPCs that we may want to add.   \n\n\nRatio: (50/50, 60/40 or 40/60)% story/smut   \n\n\nLast time I posted an ad, I got a few DMs, so I will pick on basis of: first to come first serve, and kinks compatibility. I will do a short Interview/screening before giving you the invite to the server. Also feel free to ask anything about the plot, and what would you want this world to have in it. I\u2019m open to ideas even when I have it well drafted in my mind for now.    \n\n\nDM me with the role you want to play and your discord, or for me to send you my discord.   \n\n\nWe will be of human race, although if you have a proper background to make your character demi-human it may work. Open to use RL ref images (celebs preferably from fantasy movies/shows) on agreement of the whole group, or anime ones, or both, in the end they are just references.",

I\u2019m looking for us to meet, go on a few dates, eventually get married, maybe have kids, and just form a relationship in general all while having some dirty fun in between. We can have arguments, family issues, job problems, just make it realistic as possible. \n\nScenario - I\u2019d like to start with us meeting somewhere like the gym or the club. You\u2019re about to leave when you strike up conversation. You flirt, I flirt. I invite you to dinner that night or the next. You accept. We could also have sex there, depending on whether you like to or not. If you have a better scenario, please tell me, I\u2019m open to ideas. I\u2019m also open to trying out things like teacher/student (student 18+ of course) or boss/employee roleplays, but I would prefer do just a do normal one\n\nWho will you and I play? - You will play yourself, I will play myself. If you have some overwhelming urge to play a celebrity, then maybe we can sort something out. If you want me to play a celeb, it will take some amount of convincing to do so. I prefer doing just me and you\n\nSo are you interested? Message me your character description or reference, extra points if you give a background to your character and any prompt ideas if you have them but it\u2019s not necessary.",

The relationship is meant to be toxic and manipulative, even bordering on abusive. Lots of angst and stuff, so please be aware it could contain a lot of triggering topics. \n\nIf you're interested please send me a message so we can talk on discord and discuss the characters involved in the plot.

It was just made earlier today, and offers a magic system primarily limited by your originality. It does use a very basic system to measure the strength of magic and physical skills, but is nowhere near as complex as an RPG or such.   \n\n\nIf you like creative characters that rely on unique skills, come join us!\n\n  \n\nhttps://discord.gg/zHJhqkp",

I wanted to do a roleplay set in the middle east or in a middle eastern like fictional world, a land dominated by deserts, oases, and survival of the fittest tribal ideology. I loved learning about the differences between nomadic and urban tribes, about the Christian and Jewish as well as Muslim tribes... I want to do a roleplay about a woman who rises to power on such a region and builds a magnificent empire, whether it be based on war or tolerance.\n\nI usually rp on discord. Should you be interested know that I use a character census to keep track of everyone, a history and culture channel where i can throw interesting world building facts and trivia at you, and a discussion channel for out of rp talk. Please have a reference pic ready and please please dont be intimidated! This roleplay is one that i promise you will enjoy should you love world building, drama, and history.\n\nDm me if interested! Hope to hear from you soon!",

            "selftext": "I'm bee, and I'm out here looking for roleplays again!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout Myself:\n\nI'm currently enrolled in graduate school so usually, I'm offline during the daytime. (At the moment, I'm on winter break!) I do have time to spare in my afternoons and weekends and love to roleplay as a way to wind down. I'm majoring in Electronic Music and Technology! My undergrad degrees were in Music and Computer Science, and I intend to get a second grad degree (in Composition and Improvisation) after I finish this first one. Ultimately, I'd like to achieve a doctorate, hopefully in musicology or in a field related to experimental music. I'm 26 (until February), and I prefer to write with authors over the age of 18. I've been writing and roleplaying for as long as I can remember, for at least ten years (and probably) more. I enjoy science fiction, fantasy of all flavors, historical fiction, and horror.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy Writing Preferences:\n\n\\- I love fandoms AND originals; this search is for both.\n\n\\- I love to double, triple, and potentially even more. (I almost always insist on doubling if we're doing a fandom-based rp with canons involved.)\n\n\\- For fandoms, I'll rp oc x oc, canon x canon, or canon x oc.\n\n\\- I play as and with any gender, and any pairing-type.\n\n\\- I can write a whole lot- anywhere from three paragraphs to around twelve. My comfort zone is at about five paragraphs per post, but I am flexible and down to write as much or as little as is called for when we discuss!\n\n\\- I prefer to plot a little before the rp, including discussion of comfort/discomfort zones.\n\n\\- I enjoy making profiles for my characters but am fine with or without them.\n\n\\- I do not enjoy making 'pretty' posts for my roleplays but will do so if that's your preference. (I'm not very good at it ;w;)\n\n\\- I'll roleplay in threads, PMs, on Discord, in emails, or pretty much anywhere you're comfortable.\n\n\\- I am fine with any style of picture for your reference art, or even fine with us not using reference pictures at all.\n\n\\- I like to make friends with my writing partners, so a degree of ooc chatter is appreciated (but not necessary.)\n\n\\- I'm ditch-friendly but probably won't ditch without saying something unless something WACK is going on in my life.\n\n\\- I rp a broad array of subjects, so suggest any genre! I love romance, but it doesn't always have to be a part of what we're doing. :3\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy expectations of you:\n\n\\- Be over 18\n\n\\- Use punctuation!\n\n\\- No would-style rp (I'm so sorry. I'm usually really flexible about rp stuff but I really dislike this tense- reading comprehension issues on my end make it a little rough for me.) ex: She would pick up the jar and shake it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo close off, I've got a couple of VERY VAGUE ideas for original rps:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- There's something dire down in the mines to the east of this old Western town. Folks keep goin' in to investigate, disappearin' for days at a time, then comin' back all different-like with the lights gone from their eyes. What could be happenin' out there, sheriff? (horror/western)\n\n\\- A high-fantasy world's balance is shattered when the source of magic is destroyed. How will the people of this mystical land navigate a now mundane life, and how can they survive when so many magical devices go defunct and awry?\n\n\\- A no-magic world is suddenly spun into chaos: an apocalyptic event leads to the sudden introduction of magic into a world that had previously never known it. In the post-apocalyptic (and mystically-charged) ashes of a world that once was, how do the survivors compete for resources and control?\n\n\\- A star falls from the sky! They're rare, and it's dangerous to be one. Are you the star, hunted and lost? Or are you someone who finds a star?\n\n\\- A lich (my character) is rumored to live in the castle at the foot of the mountains, only a mile or so from your town. It's said they're a true villain, the worst of the worst... but what is the truth?\n\n\\- One student (college) is an exchange student... the other is a dropout delinquent. What happens when they keep showing up at the same bus stop?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVague pairing ideas:\n\nfairy or elf / vampire or other dark creature\n\nvampire / human\n\ngod / mortal\n\ndemon / angel\n\ndragon / humanoid\n\nnaval captain / stowaway\n\nmob boss / citizen\n\nsuperhero / supervillain\n\nserial killer / investigator\n\nserial killer / citizen\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnything high fantasy, anything science fiction, anything post-apocalyptic, anything wild west.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFandoms I'm Craving:\n\nGood Omens - (Crowley x Aziraphale)\n\nMarvel - (canon x oc stuff, or ocs in a new setting)\n\nIT - (anything!)\n\nStranger Things - (anything is rad!)\n\nSteven Universe - (anything!)\n\nAvatar/Legend of Korra - (OC benders)\n\nLegend of Zelda - (anything, but I have some ideas.)\n\nStar Wars - (canon x oc or oc x oc. any era and location is fine!)\n\nThe Elder Scrolls - (I have a huge plot idea for this, but am honestly open to a lot)\n\nFallout - (your ideas- I'm kind of new to rping in this setting.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease shoot me a private message if you're interested! I've been searching for a few days now, but haven't settled in with anyone in particular yet. C'mon!!",

Anyways, as the title says, I\u2019m looking for a partner to do an Attack On Titan roleplay with! I can match any level of description that you might put out, but I\u2019d hope that you\u2019d at least put in some effort and give me detailed and descriptive responses, because that shows me that you are really enjoying the Roleplay.\n\nNow, onto specifics. I\u2019m fine if you choose to play as an OC or a canon character, I myself will be playing as an OC, and if necessary, I can control some other characters too!\n\nWhat I mainly want is for this Roleplay to be similar to the Attack on Titan 2 game, in which essentially the OC is thrust into the main plot as an additional character. It will not follow that OC\u2019s story and character development exactly, seeing as I\u2019ve got my own ideas, but that\u2019s the gist of the idea! I\u2019d love to hear any prompts that you may have yourself, so don\u2019t feel shy when messaging me!\n\nJust know that I\u2019m fully aware of the Manga plot, so don\u2019t feel the need to shy away from spoilers, I know my stuff. We can discuss things in much further detail as you message me, so don\u2019t hesitate, ill always be open for this! Just shoot me a PM and we can get started!

            "selftext": "I've no shame, I'll admit...I have the biggest soft spot for romance. So, it's no surprise that during a rewatch of that ever classic, romance film \"The Notebook\" I suddenly got a craving for a historical or AU romance. Today, I think, I'm searching for something of the women loving variety.\n\nMy hope is to find a partner to write a love story between two women. The story would be stretched over their lives together from falling in love, experiences struggles as a pair, and steadily going into their twilight years together.\n\nI would like for this to take place in a past decade with preferences for the following:\n\n* 1940's\n* Late 1950's/Early 1960's\n* 1980's\n\nNow, I am a lover of both history and alternative history. I would be happy to play out the real struggles a romance such as this would face in these time periods, but I would be equally joyful playing out an alternative timeline. Perhaps we play in a world where same sex romance isn't as frowned upon or is completely normal in these time periods? I would even be happy adding small elements of fantasy. This would be something I would love for us to build together.\n\nHere's a quick list run down of what I'm hoping for in a partner\n\n* 20+ if possible of any gender! (I'm 28, and it's nice to have someone closer to my age to write with.)\n* Detailed, Multi-Para Posts (I love being captivated by words, falling deeply into a story. Not every post has to be a novel, but I like hearing about the little things.)\n* Playing through Discord of Google Docs (Let's look back on our hard work!)\n* Someone willing to swap music playlists, indulge in character mood boards, and more! Let's get attached to our characters together.\n* Let's be friends! If we're role playing together we obviously have something in common. We should be able to speak comfortably out of character.\n* Most important? Accept that I am a hopeless romantic. I like the sappiness of it all, and I hope that you will too. Some call it cheesy but I call it sweet.",

His coat rippled in the wind as he rode in on his purebred horse. He drank socially and always tipped the tavern staff. A girl would be lucky to catch his attention, one day surely he'd give up his wild spirit to be a father to their beautiful and fair featured children.\n\nThat's all well and good... But that's also not who I fell for...\n\nYou.\n\nYou brought a new definition to rugged, one that invoked fear rather than admiration. Your worn attire didn't ripple so much as it spilled over you, the way storm clouds might spill over a valley, your eyes struck like lightning. The smell of whiskey on your breath and your skin made your vices obvious, not to mention the matchsticks in your inside pocket. It was your temper, however, that kept you unpredictable. You were defined by being undefinable. \n\nAnd me?\n\nWhat more would you expect from a girl who was raised only by my father, an accomplished thief. Mother passed during childbirth and a considerable portion of my extended family found themselves on the gallows for an assortment of things... I could have changed my ways, allowed *him* to set my life on a romantically righteous path... But my darker streak had the potential to be... Pronounced. Face it, it was always going to end this way.",

I\u2019ll explain the plot in detail for those interested. \n\nAs for myself, I consider myself literate and have been roleplaying long enough. I use third person and would hope you do too. I prefer a couple of paragraphs, but quality over quantity. I am accustomed with not fading to black, but if you write fluff well enough, then it isn\u2019t a deal breaker.

            "selftext": "So it seems that with the release of Episode IX, the amount of Star Wars posts here has increased, and I couldn't be happier! I've been craving a good Star Wars RP ever since Episode IX came out and I figure that now may be a good time to try and find a good partner who's in love with the franchise and the universe as much as I am!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm mostly looking to play an OC or two against canon characters ranging from the Old Republic Era all the way to the Sequel Trilogy, and I'm looking to create a whole new story possibly through our actions in-universe. Some of the characters that I'm looking to play against are as follows:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPadme Amidala, Ahsoka Tano, Shaak Ti, Aayla Secura, Bastila Shan, Satele Shan, Meetra Surik (The Jedi Exile), Asajj Ventress, Leia Organa, Jyn Erso, Rey\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs far as requirements, I'm not too stingy. Give me something to work with, at least a paragraph, be passable on grammar and be reasonably available, though I can totally understand if life gets in the way, just warn me if you can't reply. I also play over Discord, so please keep that in mind and be at least 20+, as I want to play with someone near my own age. I love including romance and romantic aspects into the story, so please also be fine with writing romance and I prefer smut, but only if we've built the story and the characters up to an encounter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you've made it this far, then thank you for reading and if this interests you, then feel free to PM me with who you'd want to play, and if you have your own ideas, feel free to include them! I'm more than happy to accommodate new ideas and am all for discussion!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope to hear from you all soon!",

In my role plays, I often write 2-3 paragraphs worth of content but if you want a more 'fast-paced' conversion then I'm not too bothered as long as you reply reasonably quickly :)\n\nMy favourite type of rp is any sort of supernatural creature and human romance. In these role plays, I prefer playing the human but I can do both! I can do SFW and NSFW so you can decide which way the rp goes! \n\nIf this sort of idea interests you or you happen to have a separate idea and are lacking a partner, then feel free to message me so we can discuss some rp ideas! I prefer to rp on discord but I'm open to other platforms if you'd prefer.",

            "selftext": " \n\n*The world prior to the Awakening was just like any modern world, people were more concerned about the mundane activities of living, whether they would reach tomorrow or humanity would persevere as a whole was not a common thought among the masses. This quickly changed when the global Invasion occurred, portals appeared in every major country, and from them spawned monsters. These monsters were practically immune to the modern technology humanity possessed, dragons and beasts that swallowed plains and tore tanks with their claws swarmed the world. Hope dwindled as humanity was within a few days, looking at its own extinction...this was when the\"Awakening\" occurred.*\n\n*People all over the world 1 in every 10,000 began to awaken to new abilities, gaining access to what was known as the OMNI system. A self proclaimed entity that had given humanity the power they needed to defend their world from invasion. The OMNI system like a game game humans unique abilities, roles, traits, and the power to level themselves through the combat and annihilation of monsters. Within a short time of the \"Awakening\" governments had formed groups, private organisations created groups that would search out awakened and form contracts...privatizing things. They would take materials from the monsters hunted and use this new found avenue to progress humanity.*\n\n*As time progressed humanity had managed to suppress the evasions, the portals were quarantined off and the production of monsters had slowly faded. Humanity seemed to have gained some stability in this new chaotic age. \"Awakened\" became like new celebrities, as time progressed ranks were created and even among \"Awakened\" Hierarchy formed and social status began to be dictated by such things. As the world has seemed to find balance and progressed exponentially, a new haunting question hangs over the people, is that all and what comes next?*\n\nThis world has a lot of room for development and I'm looking for someone to join me to make this world come alive, a fun and expansive world full of new things to explore and to simply have a good time in the end. I will list my requirements below but even then they are a guideline more then anything so don't feel intimidated. Within this world our character's will be holding a protagonist/antagonist role more then likely unless you want otherwise and would rather play a more back seat or \"Average\" role among the world. The world itself isn't fully developed I have tons of ideas and desires for it, but all in all I am more then willing to change and adapt according to my partner! Now read the requirements below if your interested!\n\nA little about myself before going on, i;m 22 Female Lesbian though totally fine with NPC straight relationships or anything else, but my personal character will be lesbian. I have about 10yrs of rp experience in all sorts of genre and theme, so don't worry about me not being experienced or not willing to at least try an idea of yours!\n\n**Partner Requirements**\n\n* Able to maintain a consistent 2-4 paragraphs, unless it is some back and fourth dialogue or otherwise specified\n* Have a decent grammar, spelling errors are understandable but I don't want to have to guess what you wrote\n* Able to role play NPC's (Non player characters) as I don't want to be the one solely running the world, I'm not the GM\n* LGBTQ/Race/Religion, I'm a non discriminatory person I am lesbian myself, so no bigoted individuals\n* 18+ is a must (we will discuss further through discord)\n* EST time is preferred but if your able to reply rather consistently despite your time zone that works as-well  \n**Bonus:** Knows about or likes Wuxia, Fantasy, gritty, dark themes, Games, shounen etc.\n\nThat is the best requirements I can come up with at the moment, if you meet these give me a message. Tell me a bit about yourself and what you found interesting about the given world/scenario. I will look forward to talking to you, and to make sure you didn't just skim over everything please message me with - **Yay for Oreo** \\- haha...Anyway hope to talk to you soon!",

            "selftext": "Hello there!\n\nYou might have seen my post here a few times because I am struggling to find long-term partners.\n\nMy name is Jay, and I am a 20-year-old woman currently living in Canada (Pacific Standard Timezone). I have been role playing for nearly eight years now. I am most comfortable with writing between 3-6 paragraphs per post. However, I am a firm believer in quality over quantity. \n\nHere are some things about me:\n\nI am first and for most searching for *s*omeone who is interested in getting to know each other and chatting OOCly about our RP(s). This can certainly include headcanons, playlists, mood boards, etc. \n\nSecondly, I am a full-time university student. I *love* being able to write multiple posts per day, but I won't be able to every single day. Sometimes, I might not have the time or energy to write at all, but I will try my best to keep you posted and will still appreciate dumb memes and chatting in the meantime.\n\nThirdly, I will not write with anyone under the age of 18, even if we decide to not write anything NSFW. I will also not write underage characters in compromising positions. I'm an adult, and it's just really icky.  \n\n\nLastly, I would really appreciate a decent handle on basic grammar and punctuation. I'm definitely not perfect nor asking my partner to be, but role play really allows me to work on my writing skills, and I would like my partner to know some too. \n\nWith that out of the way, let's discuss writing!\n\nI am comfortable writing both canon and OC characters, but I'm not a huge fan of putting OCs in a pre-existing world. I prefer crafting a world for said OCs with my partner. Of course, I'm always willing to be convinced!\n\nI'm a huge sucker for romance and can't get into a story without it. Now that being said, it doesn't always have to be the main focus, but I would prefer having it in the background at least. I am most interested in slow-burn romances with a ton of pining and angst, but slice of life is still wonderful to me as long as there is some plot.\n\nI'm comfortable with all romantic pairings, but I have the most experience writing M x M relationships.\n\nHere are some fandoms I'm interested in. Within each one I'll list pairings I'm used to, with the character I'm most comfortable playing listed first:\n\n\\- Good Omens (if you love Good Omens I will die the happiest of deaths) (Crowley x Aziraphale)  \n\\- Game of Thrones (Jaime Lannister x Brienne of Tarth, Sandor Clegane x Sansa Stark)  \n\\- Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency (Todd x Dirk) (comfortable with both)  \n\\- The Man from U.N.C.L.E (Napoleon Solo x Illya Kuryakin)  \n\\- Harry Potter (Severus Snape x Hermione Granger, Sirius Black x Remus Lupin, Severus Snape x Remus Lupin, Severus Snape x Harry Potter)  \n\\- Star Trek (James Kirk x Spock)  \n\\- Doctor Who (Nine x Rose Tyler, Ten x Rose Tyler, Thirteen x Yasmin Khan)  \n\\- Sherlock (John Watson x Sherlock, Mycroft Holmes x literally anyone, even OCs)  \n\\- Kingsman (Harry Hart x Eggsy Unwin)  \n\\- Dragon Age (Cassandra x Anyone, even OCs)\n\nIf you don't see your fandom or pairing listed, please ask! I might have just forgotten one or two.\n\nThank you for reading my long-winded ramble!\n\nJay",

            "selftext": "Hey there, I'm harleyz0mbiie, but you can call me Zee! I'm looking to get back into role-playing after a pretty significant hiatus, preferably with a long-term partner. Here's a bit about me:\n\n* 26 Female, native English speaker.\n* I have two degrees in English, so I'm literate and have an advanced writing level; however, don't feel too intimidated. I don't expect your grammar to be 100% correct at all times.\n* Experienced RPer; I can write up to three main characters per RP comfortably.\n* Comfortable with all gender identities and sexual orientations, but my specialty is M x M.\n* I can write 1-5 paragraphs per character per post, depending on your comfort level.\n* I will only communicate with you through Discord or email. PM me for contact information if you're interested.\n\n**My Rules:**\n\n1. **You need to be 18+ years old.** I don't write with kids/young adults, sorry. I also will not write underaged characters in a NSFW way, so don't even ask.\n2. You need to be at least semi-literate and write in complete sentences. No \\*\\* kinds of RPs, please. Additionally, I write in the third person only.\n3. I try to reply at least once per day; I expect the same from my partners. I'll give you a heads-up if I can't post every day, and I would hope you'd do the same for me.\n4. If you lose interest, just tell me. No hard feelings.\n5. **I will not do pure smut RP.** I'm comfortable in the NSFW realm as long as it's plot-related. Let's chat about your ideas over PM for that.\n6. **I will not do pure violence RP.** Once again, I'm comfortable writing violence as long as it's plot-related, but let's chat about it first.\n7. **I don't do anime at all;** this includes face claims, universes, or tropes.\n8. I would like for us to be able to share GIFs, cute pictures, videos, or whatever reminds us of our RP with each other.\n9. I would love to clean up our RP and post it as fan fiction with shared credit if you're interested. If you choose not to say yes to this, that's okay.\n10. When you message me, **be specific** about why you chose me and what you're interested in doing with our potential RP. I'll tell you if I'm not interested, or I'll ask you for more information if I am interested.\n\n**My Interests:**\n\n* Harry Potter (Marauders, Golden trio, AU, OCs, canon, whatever)\n* Horror, supernatural, spooky, occult\n* Witches, pagans, druids (any time period)\n* WWI (especially if you're into the poets like Owen, Sassoon, etc.)\n* Utopia, dystopia\n* Hannibal Lecter (basically anything, honestly)\n* Anita Blake (I'm most familiar with the first three books)\n* Arthurian Legend (let's chat)\n* Southern gothic\n* Game of Thrones (I've read the books, seen the TV series)\n* Modern captivity / Stockholm Syndrome\n* Sherlock Holmes (especially the BBC kind)\n* Modern fantasy, sci-fi\n* Slice of life (I'm picky, though: it needs a loose plot)\n* Anything else, ask me. I probably forgot something.\n\nAnyway, I look forward to hearing from you! PM me if you're interested.",

            "selftext": "\nAbout Me: I am a 20yo guy living in the EST timezone who has been writing and roleplaying since I could hold a pen. Naturally I have long learned to write in a literate manner, multi-paragraph, 3rd person, the whole shebang. Because the english language isn't my first, however, I may make minor mistakes here and there.\n\nLooking For: Recently my roleplaying has fallen off, along with my former connections disappearing. I am looking for a long term roleplaying partner to re-ignite my passion for the craft. As of right now, my preferences are VAST; I have many ideas I want to try out and am open to many more, as long as they include fantasy/supernatural elements. Want a nice romance, adventure, action and combat, both niche scenarios and standard roles between human, beast, god, specter, cyborg, and so on? I am welcome to all. Perhaps something dark, dystopian with a focus on survival? Sure, why not. Need me to make you a world, or have be in yours; perhaps come up with one together? I am all for it. Perhaps need something extremely carnal, raunchy, freaky, and deviant? I am ever so eager to please.\n\n-Listed below are my preferences-\n\nPartner:\n-18+ NSFW: No flowering up the details; regardless of theme, I enjoy more adult themes in my roleplay and desire the same from my partner. Be at least 18+\n\nLiteracy/Expertise: I expect my parter to be literate, capable of writing at least one paragraph, and be aware of all the basic roleplaying terminology. The more, the better! If you aren't very proficient in roleplaying or writing, I am more than willing to guide and help you become better. \n\nActivity: I am somewhat lenient on activity as everyone can get busy, especially myself. One post a day is fine, and if something comes up I am more than willing to wait. \n\nGender: If you want to do a roleplay with romance and/or intimacy involved, I would be much more comfortable with a female partner. \n\nGenre: While I am open to most supernatural themes, I do especially enjoy modern/future/post-apocalyptic fantasy most of all. Offering an idea in this genre will guarantee my interest.\n\nComms: I want to make something really special with you, and thus would want to be your friend as much as your roleplay partner. Lets be open with one another, and just have fun! I highly prefer Discord as our platform, but open to other platforms.\n\n-Canon/Fanon Preferences-\nWhile I am not particularly interested in fandom and canon roleplaying, there are a few exceptions should you want to do those:\n\n-Dragon Ball\n-Undertale\n-Destiny\n-Various other games and anime that I am too lazy to list.\n\nThank you for reading through all this. My DMs are open for any inquiry, and I hope to make something special and fun with you soon.",

Giant robots patrol the streets,eradicating any and all criminals. The wars are fought by men,grafted into suits of armour that make them angels of death. (Think warhammer) Not everyone agrees with the current world however. But how could mere people stand against such machines of destruction? They have biosuits. Lighter sets of armour. But one day on an operation everything goes wrong. The entire organisation is ambushed and the cause is resigned to the history books. In 1945, We have colonised other planets. But one day, the candle of the rebellion is lit again. Someone restarts the organisation from scratch after finding one of the old suits in the old base. The tech they had was remarkable. Plasma and laser based weaponry, performance enhancing suits and an old recording. \n\n\nLater on in the night,the girl plays the recording, a flickering image of a cyborg like person,documents the final moments of the old cause. \u201cWe are the rebellion! We stand against the laws and the armies of today and the future. If you hear this, I\u2019m dead. Killed by the so called authorities. I want you to restart the cause. My relatives know of this cause. My grandchild will be there on the 25th of the month of May 1945.\u201d The image flickers again before disappearing. \n\n\nOn the next day, she returns to the base and finds someone there. \u201cHello?\u201d I say to the figure.\n\n\n\n\nHey thanks for reading my prompt.

However, just before he died the Pirate King spoke his last words, screaming them to the Heavens, telling all that he had hid his treasure, the One Piece, at the end of the Grand Line, and encouraged all to seek it out.\n\nThis has sparked the interest of many a generation, encouraging people to go out and become pirates to claim riches for themselves, creating \u2018The Great Pirate Age\u2019.\n\nSo for those of you who don\u2019t know, this roleplay is inspired by One Piece, the popular manga/anime of the same name, however you don\u2019t need to know anything about One Piece.\n\nNow what am I looking for? Well I\u2019m hoping to find a partner that wants to sail the seas with me as a pirate, adventuring from island to island, raising our bounties as we go and forming a mighty crew. More details can be discussed over messages.\n\nNow for writing style, I am pretty easy on this, I don\u2019t mind if we roleplay 1st or 3rd person and I don\u2019t mind about your post length as long as I\u2019m able to reply to it.\n\nI hope this post has interested you and if so please shoot me a message.",

            "selftext": "     Hello everyone! Long time user of Reddit here! So, as I am kind of a nerd of the PC game Hearts of Iron 4 and I'm kind of a history nerd, I thought I'd throw that idea out first however! I'm looking for all types too! Let me introduce myself! ^.^\n\n     My name is Valerie, I'm female and I'm 21 years old if that matters c: I'm very friendly and open about ideas and I've been roleplaying for 10 years now in everything from fantasy, horror, slice of life, Sci-Fi and everything in between! I would consider myself pretty literate though I keep replies to a respectable size so we can actually move the story along. I'm free most of the time and dedicate myself to replying many times a day, as much as I can usually. :) \n\n     As for you! The only things I that would be deal breakers or just kind of rules I have would be the following: \n\n1.) Be friendly OOC! I like to be friendly with my partners so we can freely share ideas about the RP so we can really make it special!\n\n2.) Be 18+ mainly for any adult themes including NSFW and just violence and swearing and issues like that. I'm not comfortable RPing with someone under 18.\n\n3.) Use first person, present tense when talking through your character and third person present tense when talking through another character. I mainly do this since I'm very used to it and I feel much more connected to the story when I refer to my character as myself and it makes the story really come alive for me.\n\n4.) I'm in PST time zone so I would appriciate if you were able to work with that as well. That's up to you if our times will work but do keep that in mind before we get started :) \n\n5.) Be responsive, I like to really move the story along though I get life comes first. I'd like to get multiple replies in a day but sometimes I get we are busy and it doesnt happen. As long as you keep me up to date I'm fine! \n\n6.) I exclusively RP on Discord since it's easier to organize everything :)\n\nNow that all that is out of the way, I can vaguely explain the story. Also, if you have read everything please tell me your favorite fruit. It will be an alternative history and can be very easily customized based on what we want to do but the plot will be a romance/war where I am captured by your squad and you decide to help me escape because of my circumstances. I can go into more detail in private chat. Let me know if you are interested at all! I'm friendly! Hope to hear from you soon! \n\nLove, Valerie &lt;3",

            "selftext": "I'm looking for someone who might be interested in playing a unique fantasy roleplay world that is very flexible, it could take place in a modern setting with a sort of \"underground fantasy\" (think Hellboy) or in a more Victorian/gothic era, or even the 1700s sort of time period (doesn't have to be historically accurate haha).  The brief synopsis of the following prompt is that the heroine is a holy bearer of a sacred map, which is a living \"tattoo\" on her body that leads to a mythical treasure that is said to give it's finder unlimited power.  Once protected by an order of priestesses, she is now on her own and on the run from menevolant forces that want to use her to find the treasure.  \n\nWho you play is up to you!  Are you a purely evil villain who wants the power for himself?  Are you an antihero who wants it for his own reasons but ultimately isn't evil?  Are you a member of an underground order sent to protect the map?  There are a lot of possibilities! \n\nI would love some romance involved, we can get into NSFW or we can just fade to black if you prefer.  \n\nSee the prompt bellow and shoot me a PM if interested!\n\n_______________________\n\n\nDanika ducked into the doorway of her little apartment, taking care to bolt the door behind her.  She set down her groceries and glanced out of the single window, drawing the shades tightly before lighting a fire that illuminated the room.  It was dusty and modest, but it was temporary, it was always temporary.  \n\nOne thousand years before, a young girl identical to the present day version lay on a stone alter.  Priestesses chanted around her as a sharp needle etched blood red ink into her skin.  The tattoo was a map, a living mark that would be carried down generation to generation, a gift from the Gods that led to a source of infinite power.  It was precious, and protected for centuries by the priestesses.  But as time went on, the mark and it's story grew lost to myth, the priestesses fewer and fewer as they disappeared or fled, and it's bearer was left alone, carrying the burden of hiding and protecting the map without much aid at all.  And there were still those who remembered, who were always hunting her and it, who thirsted for the power and the mysterious treasure to which the mark led.  Lately they had grown closer, Danika could feel it.  She lifted her shirt and looked at her back in the mirror.  Rust red lines squirmed and swirled, dancing beneath her skin.  She knew it was no trick of the light; the mark was indeed *alive*, and it had recently been more and more fervent in it's activity.  It spoke to her, deep in her mind\u2026something was coming.  \nShe pulled her shirt down and looked at her face in the mirror.  She was pretty, though she looked tired, her skin pale with deepening shadows beneath her shining green eyes.  Her bobbed wavy chestnut hair was a bit disheveled from running her fingers through it so often, and her clothes were growing threadbare, hanging off her lithe frame unbecomingly.  They were a man's clothes, a simple shirt and breeches, her best disguise, though upon more than a glance her femeninity was much harder to hide than that.  She sighed and began to prepare her supplies for another leg in her journey, they were closing in, she could sense it, and it was time to move on.  As she shoved an apple into her ruck sack there was a knock at the door, and she froze.",

            "selftext": " Hey       my   name is Spoon. I've  been  role playing a long time. I used  to        write on    play by post  sites but  lately I've been taking  to     Discord.  I   have a  lot   of  ideas and I can  make a character  for     just about  any   situation.  If    you think we'd be a  good  fit    message  me even if  one  of  my ideas   didn't   grab you.\n\nOk         I   prefer  MxF   pairings. My characters are all very different    so     lets    talk about  what   we like. It'd be cool if we were    friends.   Vent    to me,   share  pictures  of  your cat. Show me    videos and  songs  you    like.\n\nI      like to  use  pictures  and   plot things out. I love twists and    drama. I   can  play  side  characters   too to build a larger world.    OOC chat is great!     Let's be  friends and   if you have ideas too I'd    love to hear them.\n\nI  had an   idea  for an average American guy visiting Japan and falling in  love   with  their culture and maybe a girl along the way. It won't be easy    from him  as there is a definite cultural and maybe even a bit of a    language  barrier. My character ideas are as follows.\n\nPRO     FIGHTER: He's a boxer in town to promote a fight against one of    Japan's  finest. He's never left America before so he's having a bit of    culture  shock.\n\nCOMIC  BOOK    CREATOR: He is the writer and artist of a successful superhero  comic    who has always wanted to check Japan out. He's in town for a  convention    and to soak in everything.\n\nTATTOO     ARTIST: This one is a bit complex. I did a bit of research and     apparently tattoos are not well liked in Japan. This guy would be tatted  up    and looking to explore. He's probably having a hard time as a lot  of    places will turn people away if they have visible tattoos.\n\nMUSICIAN:     Young and wild lead singer of a punk/metal band. This is their first     international tour. This one could be wicked fun given the fact that     from what I've read Metal is pretty big in Japan.",

Thanks for taking a look at my advertisement!\n\nMy name's Kyle, I'm 20, English and I'm currently looking for some RP partners to write some cool and original stories! Before I say about what I like to roleplay, allow me to introduce myself and my likes.\n\n \u2022 I'm currently 20, so I'm looking for someone 18+. This is mainly due to the fact that my RPs are NSFW in parts and I just wanna make sure no trouble comes of it.\n\n \u2022 I'm currently only looking for FEMALE RP Partners. I do apologize if this offends anyone of the male/trans community. Its just my personal preference. I'd also ask that you're fairly active too. A couple of posts a day at least. \n\n \u2022 I like a partner who's detailed and experienced. Fine, quickfire posts can be shorter, but I like quality in my posts. Also, I RP in THIRD person only. Again, just my preference. I also play OC Characters only as well. I don't find it entertaining to play a Canon Character. My secret word is Wolf. Please use this in your message at some point so I know you're reading all my post.\n\n \u2022 Finally, I like people who are interested in the same things as myself. Please understand what my RP is being based on. I offer a variety so there's plenty to choose from.\n\nRight! Now I have my expectations out of the way, here's the things im looking for to RP! \n\nThemes marked with an [X] are my preferred genres. This does not mean that you can't message me if you don't want to do an [X] theme, you can message me about all of the genres below!\n\n \u2022 Real Life Romance [X]\n\n \u2022 Fantasy\n\n \u2022 Sci-Fi [X]\n\n \u2022 Mecha [X]\n\n \u2022 Halo [X]\n\n \u2022 Elder Scrolls\n\n \u2022 Destiny [X]\n\n \u2022 Superhero [X]\n\n \u2022 Apocalypse\n\nI hope you all enjoyed what I've produced and I hope that I get some responses fairly soon!

            "selftext": "Hey guys! I\u2019m Rebecca and today, I\u2019m looking for someone willing to uncover the mysteries at Karla Gardner Boarding School. I will be playing as GM, while you will be the \u2018main\u2019 character. Just in case you don\u2019t know what a GM is, it basically means I will play as the world around you and the NPCs you encounter.\n\nKarla Gardner Boarding School is one of the oldest all-girl boarding schools in the country. You will be playing as the newest staff member of the school, eager to start at the prestigious institute, but it isn\u2019t long before you find yourself entangled in a web of dark mysteries. I personally think the most interesting and fitting jobs for you to take are either school nurse or head of security, but if you insist, I suppose a teacher could work as well. I\u2019d prefer one of the first two though, I find them more unique really.\n\nA few other things you need to know:\n\n- Romance as part of a story is fine, but it being the main focus is not my thing. \n\n- I\u2019d like the mysteries to be somewhat of a darker nature, so make sure you\u2019re alright with that\n\n- I place a lot of value in reference pics, so I please ask anyone interested make sure to include visual references for their characters. Actual pictures that is, not art.\n\n- Because of some bad experiences in the past, I\u2019m only looking to RP with fellow women. Sorry guys!\n\n- I\u2019m only looking to RP on Kik, so make sure you have that when you PM me.\n\n- I\u2019m fairly active and online often, so bonus points if you are too.\n\nHope to hear from you soon!",

            "selftext": "You lived a normal life, at least what you might consider normal school/work. A family, maybe no family. Either way, before this your life had been so different. So much has changed in such a little amount of time. \n\nThe last thing you recall was watching the world invert on you, collapsing in on itself almost. Then when it came back, you were in the middle of a large open field. There were trees everywhere, flowers were blooming, you even saw farmlife... In a natural state? Pigs, cows even sheep. Everything was peaceful.\n\nAs you explored you discovered more types of life, it seemed to go from green grass to a snow covered wonderland in an instant. Even areas full of swamp, and others of nothing but the finest sands. With such a beautiful escape from the usual life you almost forget you have no idea where you are and that... there's no one else around. \n\nThese masses of land begin to stretch almost infinitly, before long you have no idea where you are. What part of the world could be so diverse in weather and climate. Then nightfall came and you were unsure of where to go, nothing felt right. You almost gave up and slept on the ground but then, hideous monstrosities of creatures began to chase you. You had no choice but to run for shelter. \n\nShelter is exactly what you found. Old abandoned buildings that were barely intact. These walls kept you safe for the night. It has been 48 days since then. You rebuilt one of the homes, kept yourself safe and well nourished. You had to, to survive that is. In this world void of human life all you could focus on was your safety. \n\nOne night however you strayed too far from home. At too late an hour, the same monsters cut you from your normal route and caused you to run. You fled for hours, trying to avoid the creatures of the night. Then, suddenly you found yourself face to face with one clad in full armor and armed with a sword. Though he wore a helmet that covered his face, the night sky gave light to his eyes, they were the most human you had seen in the last month. \n\nHe seemed just as shocked as you, lowering his weapon and staring almost struggling to find his world's before a well placed arrow found itself between the eye holes of his armor and through flesh. He fell to the ground and after you took care of the threat, you decided the best course of action would be to hide. So you hid, until daylight brought hope back to you. \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGreetings! I hope this general opener of sorts intrigued you and I hope to find the right partner for it!! (also if you got what the prompt is based on let me know when you message me) thanks!",

I'm looking for someone to play Parvati in a little romance because I knew romance wouldn't be a thing- but I didn't expect to like the naive engineer so much.\n\nWe'd be starting from the moment my \"main character\", (We'll be working together, so I'm only really the \"main character\" for simplicity's sake) and Parvati meet in Mr. Tobson's office. We'd go from there, just playing through and making our own story loosely following the events of the game as I play through it. No spoilers please!\n\nOnce we reach the end of our little tale as far as the game's story is concerned, we can just keep going. I wouldn't mind making stuff up- I just hope the \"main character\" doesn't die at the end of the game or we'd have to fudge some things, haha.\n\nI can type anywhere from 1 paragraph to 3 depending on just how much I have to go off of. I also use Discord, Reddit, AND Kik. I can play whatever gender you are more comfortable with, though I would prefer to play a female. (We can discuss this more in private.)\n\nHopefully we can rp!

The story will follow military scientists and their test subjects as they figure out the repercussions of increasing bio-integration on their circuitry.\n\nReally, I'm looking for anyone who would be interested in playing this premise through.\n\nWe are doing this over Discord, looking for a maximum of four participants including myself (will work with what I get). At certain times we may use a dice roller for randomized outcomes to keep things interesting--namely as a gauge for degrees of success or failure.\n\nThe only real expectations that I have are a sense of humour while still playing this story straight, maturity, and open communication.\n\nI can field questions and issues for clarification here, otherwise please PM me so we can figure out a method to this madness.\n\nThanks for reading!",

            "selftext": "Hey there, I'm harleyz0mbiie, but you can call me Zee! I'm looking to get back into role-playing after a pretty significant hiatus, preferably with a long-term partner. Here's a bit about me:  \n\n\n* 26 Female, native English speaker.\n* I have two degrees in English, so I'm literate and have an advanced writing level; however, don't feel too intimidated. I don't expect your grammar to be 100% correct at all times.\n* Experienced RPer; I can write up to three main characters per RP comfortably.\n* Comfortable with all gender identities and sexual orientations, but my specialty is M x M.\n* I can write 1-5 paragraphs per character per post, depending on your comfort level.\n* I will only communicate with you through Discord or email. PM me for contact information if you're interested.\n\n**My Rules:**\n\n1. **You need to be 18+ years old.** \n2. You need to be at least semi-literate and write in complete sentences. No \\*\\* kinds of RPs, please. Additionally, I write in the third person only.\n3. I try to reply at least once per day; I expect the same from my partners. I'll give you a heads-up if I can't post every day, and I would hope you'd do the same for me.\n4. If you lose interest, just tell me. No hard feelings.\n5. I can do NSFW as long as it's plot-driven. Let's chat.\n6. **I don't do anime at all;** this includes face claims, universes, or tropes.\n7. I would like for us to be able to share GIFs, cute pictures, videos, or whatever reminds us of our RP with each other.\n8. I would love to clean up our RP and post it as fan fiction with shared credit if you're interested. If you choose not to say yes to this, that's okay.\n9. When you message me, **be specific** about why you chose me and what you're interested in doing with our potential RP. I'll tell you if I'm not interested, or I'll ask you for more information if I am interested.\n\n**My Interests:**\n\n* Harry Potter (Marauders, Golden trio, AU, OCs, canon, whatever)\n* Horror, supernatural, spooky, occult\n* Witches, pagans, druids (any time period)\n* WWI (especially if you're into the poets like Owen, Sassoon, etc.)\n* Utopia, dystopia\n* Hannibal Lecter (basically anything, honestly)\n* Anita Blake (I'm most familiar with the first three books)\n* Arthurian Legend (let's chat)\n* Southern gothic\n* Game of Thrones (I've read the books, seen the TV series)\n* Modern captivity / Stockholm Syndrome\n* Sherlock Holmes (especially the BBC kind)\n* Modern fantasy, sci-fi\n* Slice of life (I'm picky, though: it needs a loose plot)\n* Anything else, ask me. I probably forgot something.\n\nAnyway, I look forward to hearing from you! PM me if you're interested.",

            "selftext": "They say that deep down in the bayous and murky swamps of backwoods Louisiana, there is a town.\n\n\nIt\u2019s one of those small, sleepy places, lost to modern history by the ever progressing, fast pace of society. And why wouldn\u2019t it be? Paved roads were scarce, giving way to winding dirt paths that were sometimes too narrow to fit two cars at once on their densely wooded passages. A perpetual fog hangs over the town, coating everything in an ethereal mist that seeped in from over the still waters of the mysterious Munbrook Lake. Didn\u2019t little Johnny from Ashland go missing there just last summer? \u00a0\n\n\n\nThey say the town is haunted. \u00a0\n\n\n\nThat the ghosts of past settlers rise up from the marshy land and deep verdant mosses to wander incorporeally through the land of the still-living. That the spirits of long gone, forlorn soldiers seeking their lost loves can still be heard in phantom cries cutting through the hot Southern nights, if one just stayed quiet enough. That the town is rife with all kinds of beasts that go bump in the night; they\u2019ll keep their distance, they say, so long as you keep yours. \u00a0\n\n\n\nBut whatever you do, stay out of the Spindlewood. \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 Something Wicked is an advanced literate/novella roleplay server set in a Southern Gothic theme. Our story takes place in the fictional town of Fairhaven, Louisiana, in the year 1993. The majority of the human population is completely unaware of the existence of supernatural folk, and many of the supernaturals prefer to keep it that way. But new advancements in technology, the internet, and a shrinking world threatens to tip the balance of Fairhaven daily. How will you survive? \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 Our server features:\n\n\u00bb Advanced level writers who regularly post novella-style interactions. \n\u00bb Many playable races, including vampires, werefolk, witches, the fae, and the ever-reliable humans.\n\u00bb A friendly, safe, and welcoming community. \n\u00bb Channels dedicated to character building and aesthetics. \n\u00bb Pre-built but simple lore for new members to review and jump right in. \n\u00bb A niche genre of writing with the possibility of many dynamic, interesting, and bizarre characters. \n\u00bb A mature and grisly setting that calls for an audience above the age of 18. \n\u00bb Additionally, all characters must be above the age of 18. \n\u00bb The opportunity to actively contribute to and develop storylines\n\n\n\n\n\nWe look forward to meeting you! \u00a0 https://discord.gg/AKn4kmA",

            "selftext": "Hello, my name is Roxy. I have been roleplaying for quite a long time now, but that doesn't mean I am an expert nor will I ever be. I don't worry about spelling, grammar, or word count. I'm pretty relaxed when it comes to roleplay, just looking to create a story. \n\nI mainly play as my OC for my main role, but I'll gladly play as other roles on the side to help with the story. However, I don't want to be the only one puppeting a bunch of people without reason. You can play as whoever you want, as long as you are comfortable and happy with the decision. \n\nI'm only looking for Borderlands roleplay right now. Just not for the first and third games, I have not played the third and I did not like the first as much as the others. The second, pre-sequel, and tales are fair game for setting though. \n\nPlot ideas can be discussed since I normally wing most of them to see where we go and what ideas come up. \n\nIf you are interested, please message or comment me. Feel free to ask as many questions before thinking about starting!",

It also won\u2019t make up the bulk of the storyline. Just know that going in! \n\nScenario #1:  My char has been in love with your char since they were children. They had a romantic relationship when both were older, but my char got into some trouble and left town without warning. It\u2019s been two years, and my char has returned home and reaches back out to your char.  You, the player, and I will hash out more details as needed. \n\nScenario #2:  My char, a young, intelligent college freshman, catches the attention of her professor, who is recently engaged. Your char, the professor, is intrigued but cautious. \n\nDM me if interested!",

I can try to play any character from the anime listed below, but having a list to choose from is nice. \n\n*Characters you\u2019re looking to interact with:*\n\nThese are listed from MOST to LEAST wanted.\n\n-*MHA:* Shinsou Hitoshi, Bakugou Katsuki, Ojirou Mashirao, Sero Hanta. \n\n-*Naruto:* Gaara, Kankuro, Kiba\n\n-*Demon Slayer:* Inosuke, Tomioka, Rui\n\n-*Doctor Stone:* Senku, Gen\n\n-*One Punch Man:* Garou, Metal Bat, Genos\n\n*Grammar/Length requirements:* No text talk unless it is in an actual text or note between characters. I write in third person and ask if you do the same! As for length I usually match what my partner sets, though I do prefer to do anywhere from 250 words up to 600 per reply. \n\nIf I sparked your interest, please message me with a little about yourself and what you\u2019d be interested in roleplaying!",

I have played the G.U games but didn't find them as enjoyable as the previous four games, but if G.U is all you are familiar with, that's fine. \n\nI would love to do something with certain canon characters but might be down for an all OC cast, provided that they are created within reason (ie: new players). \n\nI'd love to do something with Kite and Blackrose as well as exploring things post-Quarantine with online and offline life together. \n\nI might be down to do something with Haseo and Atoli or maybe Atoli and Kuhn? Or maybe bringing Kite and Blackrose into R:2. \n\nIf anyone is open for discussion, let me know! You must be open to discord and capable of posting several paragraphs on average. NSFW optional.",
