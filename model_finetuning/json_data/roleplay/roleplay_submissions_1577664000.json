My absolute favorites are historic and fantasy combined and slice of life.\n\nI'm willing to play any gender and I don't mind what gender you'd like to play.\n\nI also do not want a roleplay that's solely consists of nsfw things. I don't mind nsfw things, but I don't want it to be the center of the roleplay.\nI like to create a long, nice story. Which means that I'd love to become friends with the person that I'm writing with :)\n\nI also have a character in mind, I'd love to hear about yours! \n(I also have a few story ideas in mind :3)\n\nI hope to hear from you soon! :)",

Through my years of gaming, reading and role-playing I've found myself quite attracted to strong female characters. I admire the way the character is focused, strong and not afraid to hide her beauty completely. Please excuse the cliche description. I am referring to the characters put in games and books about ancient/fantasy lands.\n\nMy character are :\n\n1. A travelling scholar who knows his way with the sword thanks to his older brother.\n2. An assassin who takes no interest in common dealings unless it is a contract. Although his league has a code that if he refused a contract for personal reasons, he will be discharged and no longer protected.\n\nYour character can be anyone! A shopkeeper, captain of the guards, a doctor, royalty or anything you think of.\n\nFor reference, but not limited to, Seeker Cassandra Pendergast from Dragon Age Inquisition.\n\nI hope you get where I am going and that we would talk soon!",

            "selftext": "\nHey guys! I'm Shamoo, a 21+ female with almost two - *oof* \\- decades of roleplay experience. I'll put a list below of what I'd like in a partner but, before that, I'll let you know a little bit more about my style! I consider myself high-casual, closer to advanced than casual, and like to focus on character relationships. I'm a sucker for romance, so if our characters click I'll ultimately opt for them to attempt a relationship if not only for drama's sake. That doesn't mean romance should be the only thing happening in the roleplay, so I do like an overarching plot and themes of friendship. I love both quality and quantity and, although I tend to mirror my partner's length, I can guarantee at least 500+ words per reply for those wanting the longer replies. I prefer to play females in MxF pairings; I realize, however, that the majority of this site so far seems to as well. I'll absolutely double with any pairing if you don't feel comfortable, or don't want to, solely play a male character.  \n\n\nI'm down for mature themes and NSFW content, although I admit I have the usual limits and oftentimes opt for more vanilla interactions. I'm not looking for PwP, though, and would prefer that we detail scenes that are important and make sense, fading to black for all other intimate points in our stories. Let me know what your limits are and I'll be happy to abide by them!  \n\n\nThe short of it is, I'm looking for someone who is over 18, creative, easily excitable, and passionate about writing. Interesting characters, dialogue that leaves me wanting more, emotions and thoughts and feelings that make me understand why your character does what they do... I want that. As far as writing style, I will admit that I can be particular. In order to combat this, I'd like to offer one of my own writing samples for something you have so that we don't get super invested for things to only sputter and die out. As aforementioned, I am looking for someone to main a male character but am completely willing to double as whatever you wish! Along the lines of doubling, I do like to provide supplementary characters and would hope you do as well.  \n\n\nI'm not available all the time, and I doubt you are, either. There are sometimes days between my replies, sometimes an hour. In that vein, I'm not going to hassle you if it takes a week - or two - to get a reply. I would want for the same thing from my partner: patience. If you're a ghoster, that's okay. Sometime life gets in the way. If you do drop the roleplay and I love it, I'll likely pick it back up at any second. If I stop responding and you want to pick it back up after awhile, that's fine, too.  \n\n\nAs far as genres, I'm happy to report that I can be interested in almost anything with the right plot. However, my butter-and-bread would likely be medieval fantasy, modern gritty slice-of-life, and historical Pride and Prejudice romance. As far as fandoms I am fairly limited, mostly to Dragon Age and Mass Effect. I'll place a word bank below and bold my cravings. I do have some plots but not many... and honestly they're just generic starters. So I'd love to get something together that we're both excited about, invested in, and can gush over.   \n\n\n**love through loss** / arranged marriage / **modern** / **slice of life** /   \nmedieval fantasy / gritty / **detective x witness** / **World War II**   \n**ancient civilizations discovered** / Pride and Prejudice-esque /   \n**enemies to friends** / Hurt-comfort / Dragon Age / Mass Effect  \nurban fantasy / **Slow-burn** / 1920's / apocalyptic / post-apocalyptic  \ndystopian / futuristic fantasy / **\"forbidden\" romance**   \n\n\nI prefer roleplaying over GDocs but can manage the annoying Discord limits.  \nI do have a Discord for OOC chatter, though.  \n\n\nSo if we sound like a good fit, PM me! Please don't post here as I likely won't see it.",

            "selftext": "Hi everyone, so to jump into this im from Australia, there will be a timezone difference, looking for a detailed roleplayer whos interested in the below plot, please dont msg me for other rps.\nMostly I'm wanting someone who has time, and wont ghost me after day cause i dont have the effort to be constantly chasing up and preparing discord servers for nothing.\n\nI'd like to consider myself fairly detailed, with over 10ish years of roleplaying on and off.\nI'm a little out of practice but i'm relatively active in my responses\nI only want to roleplay on a discord server, im not a fan of the mobile reddit app.\n\nIm fine with nsfw topics, but im not looking for ERP, that stuff can be included, but not the focus\n\nI like keeping characters in the dark, discovering who people are and what's really going on- where's the fun in knowing everything at the start?\nIm not a fan of heavy romance of slice of life roleplays, i like a bit more conflict and so on.\nIf you're interested please dm me your discord\n\nPlease note this is an alternate history, things are different, history rewritten and events will change in past and present. As well as this role is a first draft so its rough around the edges and pretty vague obviously.\n\nPre-wwll, a man by the name of Anton Yanovich is german born russian, studying in berlin. \nPapers written on artificial  life, a lifes work was shunned by the german officials who it was shown to, laughed at, of course you only had theory but a one room apartment and a parttime job didn't leave much options to produce a prototype.\nThrough the grapevine you hear word of the Russian goverment seeking scientists for a project, an opportunity of a lifetime, letters and papers sent to moscow received a swift response and the first train in the morning welcomed you.\nA whole life packed into only two trunks and a suitcase. \nA woman was to meet you at the train station to show you the way,\n\nYour work focused on how to create artificial human life, while it may similarly be used in the creation of animals it was much more impressive to create humans.\nThis roleplay follows your character (Anton) \nA decent into madness, power. To follow the journey into creating artificial life, under Soviet law.\nLongterm this role can span alot more. You for the most part only need to play Anton, however you may need to play other characters.\n\n,,german born russian scientist returning to the land of your people after the first world war with only your assistant and your life's work. It will be a long journey to fulfill your dream at creating artificial life",

The concept and options are written below. A starter is in place dependent on your choice. Please pm me to rp on Kik, Reddit or Google Docs with your choice and any questions you may have along with an example of your writing. I am looking for the same kind of stylization of writing below and the same type of effort. I am not strict on length but rather the content you are giving me. I cannot give what I do not get.\n\n**General concept:** You are a mystical being (whatever that may be, per your choosing, preferably one of the ones listed above unless you have an interesting choice you would like to try out) in need of some assistance for your day to day endeavors. An Assistant, perhaps, is in store, to tend to your every need; be it in business, safety or even personal desires. \n\n**Options:** This concept can be guided in one of two ways regarding my character- \n\n1. My character is an unsuspecting human, having wandered a bit too far one night, away from any city or town. Your character happens upon a woman that longs to be a part of something greater than herself, a world completely new than the one she knows. Maybe you\u2019d be able to teach her something and get a lovely assistant out of it?\n2. My character is a familiar chosen and gifted to you by an acquaintance, having understood the desire to have someone to keep you company and help you through your chaos of a day to day while, hopefully, brightening it up for you. Or, at the very least, keep you entertained. \n\nBoth concepts are looking to actual world-building and story-line. I look forward to playing with those that are interested.",

I don't really care if it's a portal, a magic spell, or getting hit by a truck.. \n\nBasic stuff includes things like:\n\n- Waking up in this crazy new world!\n- How are we going to get home?\n- What are the rules of this place?\n- What are those creatures? And why are they looking at us like we're lunch?\n- Finding cool magic items! \n\nIt would be fun if we could squeeze in some magic stuff like us gaining powers after being sent to the new world or coming across a town full of beastkin or cute animal people. \n\nSome stuff I want to include:\n- RPG elements (Some kind of 'class system', stats are cool too but a lot of work...) \n- Goblins, Slimes, demons, and other fantasy monsters!\n- Interacting with people native to the fantasy world (Gawking at our wierd modern clothing)\n- Fledgling romance between our characters that gets derailed due to our wacky adventures...! \n- Fight Scenes between us and evil monsters! Or against evil humans! Or against overly zealous good humans! \n\n\n\nSend me a message if your interested. I know this is kind of specific and wierd but I don't care. Please let me know if you want to see anything specific or if you have any character references in mind. I'm very flexible with who I can play, but I highly prefer playing women.\n\nOh and while this is a largely sfw roleplay I don't really feel comfortable playing with anyone under 18 so please let me know your age when you message me! \n\nThanks! You can go back to doing whatever you were doing now!",

I enjoy fantasy, slice of life, or adventure. Supernatural is great as well! \n\nThe main plot I want to do is basically a toy story type thing. Interesting right ? Anyways was looking for someone who would be interested in playing as toys in a kid's room. We'd be able to rp as multiple toys ofc and would be going on adventures with the child. I'm thinking more of a one child home but we could also do a day care or a home with multiple kids. \n\nI mostly rp on discord! So message me for more information and we can develop the plot more.",

I am female, 20+ and have around 6 years of roleplaying experience, but mostly 1x1. I tried many genres, but I like Romance and Fantasy the most, when I am not currently roleplaying in a fandom setting. This search post is just about Romances, because that is what I am craving the most right now. \n\nI roleplay in third person, past tense and I really can't use first person, sorry!\n\nThese ideas are all fantasy, but I am very open to hear your ideas that can also be non-fantasy. Even though I prefer fantasy ideas a little bit. \n\n1) The first idea is a medieval fantasy setting where humans are only used for working, while Vampires reign. OC is a young woman and servant to the Vampire Lord, while she tries to stay alive, but somehow ends up getting closer to the Lord himself.\n\n2) After a battle with some witch hunters, OC, finds herself in the back of a bakery the next morning with no one less than  the young baker himself. \n\n3) OC is a princess. Flawless, beautiful and the second child of the king after her older brother, but that's all she doesn't want to be. At night, she is a feared assassin, enjoying the free and dangerous life outside the castle. Until her father hires a bodyguard for her who is meant to prevent her from sneaking through the castle again.\n\nPM me if you're interested! Also with your own ideas if you have some.",

Some of the fandoms I am open to are listed below, but this is by no means a comprehensive list.\n\nStar War\n\nSoul Eater\n\nBNHA\n\nAttack on titan\n\nNaruto\n\nTokyo Ghoul\n\nHalo\n\nRWBY\n\nFire Emblem\n\nTo any interested, I hope to hear from you soon. Once more, if you don't see a fandom you'd like to try listed, just give it a mention to me and I'll let you know If that's one I know about/would be willing to try. Just shoot me a PM and I'll provide my contact info from there.",

I do love this OC and I just want to do something really wholesome with her. Also, no  NSFW stuff, if the story ends up with them doing intercourse, it will be fade to black. Falling in love is cool but nothing inappropriate.\n\nAlthough it may never come to that. There's only one constant with this, my OC. A black haired, pale skinned, tall, powerful witch. Naturally purple eyes and the best at what she does. A tall, powerful beauty who lives in isolation. Some say she's far more powerful than the legends go. She's lived for as long as records and legends have existed. But she's *alone*. She had a castle almost, in which she overlooked the kingdoms. (Or maybe they weren't kingdoms. Maybe she lives on a starship if want a Sci fi/magic amalgamation). And one day something happens, something life changing.\n\nBut what is it? Maybe she wanders the streets and finds a poor child begging for adoption and she takes her in? Maybe she meets/saves someone who won't let her go? Or whatever we choose to decide, that involves her meeting someone that changes her life. But I'd love it to be wholesome and pure. Something to really lift up both of our spirits and make 2020 a really happy year. A roleplay full of happy events and cheerfulness.\n\nI do warn you, I'm.. *cough cough* neuroatypical. So if I'm a bit weird at first, it isn't your fault. It's Asperger's. I use discord and I don't mind the length. Typically I do 1-2 paragraphs, however if you use more. I will make an effort to match that. I'll put the effort in that you do. I hope to talk to some wonderful people from this prompt.\n\nHappy 2020 to everyone. :)",

            "selftext": "Hello! So I\u2019ve recently got a craving for an rp featuring mechs. I don\u2019t have an actual plot idea, but the basics is that our characters are in a military or something (we could also go the darling in the franxx route) and we\u2019ve got mechs in order to fight monsters and other mechs. We will create our own custom and unique mechs. Also, rather than \u201ccontrolling\u201d mechs, you transport your consciousness into the mech whenever you want to use it. However, you need to link up with it which requires you to enter it. When you are linked with it, you will suffer the same damage as the mech, but there is no way for you to die unless your body gets attacked. So if your mech gets badly damaged, you will also get badly damaged. Of course it may not be as extreme so you won\u2019t die, but you will be badly hurt. If the mech gets a cut, you do too. Pretty simple, right? Also, whenever you transport your consciousness into the mech, you have full control over it and it essentially feels like controlling your body.\n\nThis rp will be held on discord. If you are interested, DM me!",

            "selftext": "Heyya Roleplayers, I\u2019ve been out of the writing loop for a few months so I simply decided to jump back in and see what happens, I generally have a lot of fun. \n\nI, As of late, have been listening to a lot of emotional pop music and as such have taken to bouts of being Dramatic, Romantic and overly forlorn. So, naturally I wanted to RP a tale of ravenous love. Perhaps quite a tempestuous romance, as these kind of affairs tend to be, yet still, one filled fiery passions and smouldering desires. \n\nI\u2019d would love to discuss where this tale might lead and of course the setting for this bardic epic of trials and tribulations that rival that of the Trials of Heracles, is situated within the confines of our fair four corners of Azure and Verdancy. It doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be Wuthering Heights themed but it\u2019s that kind of idea. I\u2019m not terribly worried about the historicity of the story, without a doubt this endeavour between me and thee is in the pursuit of happiness not archaic tedium. \n\nAnd if you would like to make it macabre, eldritch or arcane, or all three,  I\u2019m sure I could pluck some ideas from somewhere; given half a chance. \n\nIt does not necessarily have to be NSFW, it can be very twee, innocent and saccharine, or tastefully intriguing before the curtain falls upon the scene of our two lovers.\n\nI hope to hear from you lovely people soon. I am very tired so apologies if I don\u2019t reply for a while but surely if we are star crossed lovers, destined to embrace as Cupid, Winged Seraphim, did entwine like roots of trees that touch from across an orchard, with his paramour, Keat\u2019s muse of that most humanly virtue; Psyche. That despite such great distances that separate them, they are as close as one thought is from another. Surely, if all that is so, then I will see you in my dreams, my sweet. \n\nElsewise, I\u2019ll message you in the morning.\n\nBest, \n\nJanco",

            "selftext": "Fifty years after Naruto Uzumaki, the Nanadaime Hokage, light of the Shinobi World, finally passed just days after his wife - Hinata Hyuga (1109). The tranquility that he had breathed into a young world took the form of the organization known as the Shinobi Union began to give way. Like all things, it was victim of a cyclic decline. The future generations of Kage of the Great Shinobi Nations and their villages could no longer find the common ground necessary to govern themselves as a unit. During Sarada Uchiha's reign as Kyudaime Hokage, the Union shattered into the five original pieces with countless splinters and shards. The political upheaval created a vacuum of conflict that bred the Fifth Great Ninja War.  Iwagakure is forced into a martial alliance with Kumogakure and Kirigakure before the two more aggressive villages lead a two-pronged attack on the Land of Iron and the Sunagakure and Konohagakure alliances. The Land of Iron decimated the Shinobi and immediately sealed their borders to any and all outsiders.  With the brunt of the Kumo-Kiri-Iwa forces routed the Konoha/Suna alliance is allowed to breathe and survive the war until a stalemate is formed. Unfortunately, Kirigakure is destroyed during this process and the Land of Water is thrown into an economic depression the likes of which have never been seen before.\n\nDuring this despair, not all was lost. Even with Konohagakure crippled in strength, the Uzumaki clan has began to flourish over the course of generations, as well as the Uchiha clan. Restarting strong in Konohagakure during Sarada Uchiha's reign as Hokage. The ire of the intermingled histories of the Uchiha with the origin of Konoha returned to the surface to some dissenting Uchiha and the group left the village for life abroad. Refusing to stay in such a place any longer. Allowing for Uchiha of other villages to begin their origins. The Biju, tailed beasts, are free to roam the land. But have focused their activities in the area known as the Valley of the Biju. A place ornamented by the ruins of Uzu and the Tomb of Naruto.\n\nThe world is healing and the villages are once again open to cooperating - at least in theory.\nThe year is 1259 YC\n\nTL;DR: This Roleplay takes place 50 years after the Fourth Great Shinobi War. But instead of directing following in Boruto\u2019s story, this roleplay diverges paths after Naruto Shippuden. Though it may take influence and ideas from parts of Boruto. ALL USER MADE CHARACTERS ARE OCs!\n\n---\n\nYes! That is right! A NEW Naruto roleplay is here! here we pride ourselves on out basic stat mechanics and our laid back style. Here you will be a Hidden Leaf ninja and you'll make your way up to a powerful nin and create your own journey! Please join us at r/KonohagakureRP today and [MAKE A CHARACTER](https://www.reddit.com/r/KonohagakureRP/wiki/charctersheet)!\n\nRight now we are in the midst of an investigation of an attack on the village.

Those caught in the act by their vision orbs and judged to be \u201ctransgressors\u201d are hunted down and punished by \u201cenforcers.\u201d\n\nAfter tragedy falls to two people simply living their lives and cruel rules of the world, they are judged and branded as transgressors. Wishing to live, they flee and encounter a notorious person simply known as \u201cThe Great Transgressor.\u201d\n\nThey offer them a choice: \u201cOwn your sin or let it own you.\u201d With this choice in mind, they decide to accept their sin and the weight of their crimes. With their new resolve and gaining the ability to draw forth their own sin as the power of the \u201cblood sin\u201d they set off into the world to find respite from the world that wishes for them to be erased. \n\nHello there and thanks if you decided to read my prompt. So thanks to being inspired by a lot of games, stories, and anime, I had the idea for this roleplay in mind. It's one that I have really been meaning to get around to writing out so I'm happy to of finally done it. \n\nThe rp will be very story-driven as stated in the title with plenty of drama, suspense, and action as well as more calm moments too. \n\nNow as for partner stuff and my own way of writing, I  typically do better writing at least two or three paragraphs but I can do more if you are up to it. I also find it more fun to play more than one character but that is just me so I don't mind if you just want to stick to one.\n\nNow I do have a life so there will be at times where I will be busy I do tend to keep updates on my situation so that you may know how it is and when I may be free or busy. Last thing though, please at least be 18 or older since I don't exactly like the thought of roleplaying with a minor and am more comfortable with people around my age with that being 20.\n\nIf you're interested or have any questions, just message me and I will send you my discord stuff.",

I am 27 so would prefer that my partner be 20+ and that we use 3rd person, past tense. I prefer discord.\n\n\nThe RP is set in a Medieval Fantasy setting in which magic isn't domineering but is common enough to be a known entity to most people. You would have a huge amount of freedom in deciding who and what your character would be. I have a character and the beginning to a plot that is open enough to allow you to play as anything and the relationship between our characters to be whatever we want it to be, friends, lovers, enemies, strangers... anything is on the table.\n\n\nIf you are interested, shoot me a DM and I can provide more specific details on the plot and hopefully we can make something fun happen.",

            "selftext": "Hey everyone, I\u2019m looking for a partner that would be interested in doing a long term gay roleplay. I don\u2019t have many rules about it, just preferably that we write in 3rd person and if by chance you get busy please warn me so I know you didn\u2019t lose interest. Also I\u2019d prefer if the roleplay, at least in the beginning stages, stayed more on the topic of developing the plot and the characters.\n\nMy idea for the plot falls a bit on a clich\u00e9 Twilight like plot. So a new mysterious and weird guy moves town and starts attending the main character\u2019s school. Of course he turns into the hot topic and rumours and gossiping quickly start spreading about who he might be but the whole school is too intimidated to approach him because of his strange aura. However the main character doesn\u2019t care much about the whole thing and ignores the existence of the other guy until they get paired up in a group project.\n\nI\u2019m fine with roleplaying as any of the characters so feel free to tell me what\u2019s your preference. Thanks for reading all of this and if you are interested please send me a message so we can discuss more about it and so I can give you my username. I\u2019m able to role play either on kik or discord.",

The roleplays themselves might not contain NSFW material, but this is for my own comfort. \n\nBe it modern or medieval, I always prefer when there's at least some sort of fantasy element. I'm biased towards plots that involve action with a slow romantic build-up and turning cliches on their head. As far as length is concerned, I prefer multi paragraphs respones that are in third person. I write in advanced Lit. and I want my partner to be able to do the same. Also, I'm very chill when it comes to response frequency. I understand that there is a life outside of the roleplay.\n\nIf any of this sounds like your cup of tea, please message me!

I'm looking to write something set during the events of the books or the modern era. I'm fine with M/M or F/M pairings. As the title states, I'm down to play either gender/sex. I enjoy writing OC/OC pairings since this is most popular within the fandom, but I'm a sucker for anyone interested in Hermione/OC (either with me or yourself portraying her).\n\nI'm open to discussing the plot/story. I'm interested in both complex and simple/slice of life scenarios. I have no interest in playing as adult wizards as I want the story set within the school. I never got my letter to Hogwarts, so this is the only way I can get there.

It\u2019s so fun to play out....if you have any ships I would love to explore them with you! Also this can be as dark or as light as you can handle!\n\nI would prefer to do this over on discord and I tend to match the response length of my partners. \n\nMessage if interested!",

If you haven't read/watched it, I'd recommend it, but the basic plot is that an old dog loves his owner so much that he wants to pass away sooner under the belief that he'll be reincarnated as a man and he'll be able to stay with his owner. Well, what if that were actually the case? I'm looking for someone,male or female, to play the reincarnation of my characters' dog. I'd prefer if your character was female though, but I don't care what gender you are in real life. Just a quick note, your character will be 100% human, she'll just remember how things were in her past life. And she'll be reincarnated as a grown woman because plot reasons. Anyway, if you're interested or have any questions, my comments and inbox is always open! I hope this interests some of you!\\~",

I'm in the US, PST, and would really like to find someone to create a character with and watch them grow alongside one another. I am also a male in the process of transitioning to a female, so if that's a deal breaker I understand, though in game I'd like to play a female character across from another as my title states. Your RL gender does not matter to me, only your in-game characters.\n\nI'm a huge fan of romance, so that is something I am seeking, though not right out the gate. I'd really love to see some natural progression with that and spend some time planning out just how our characters meet and end up with one another and some backstory. Elements of drama, adventure, and intrigue are also very much welcome, though I have only made it to the end of the Stormblood MSQ, so please keep that in mind.\n\nI have played the game in the past but am pretty rusty at things now. I'm open to race/job choices, and have tanked and healed in the past. I also have some experience in WoW and a few other MMO's, so I'm not a total lost cause! I currently have a character on Crystal, but since I'd like to start fresh with this, I could really go anywhere within reason. (Not sure how bad the lag would be for me on some of those options.)\n\nIf you're interested, please let me know, if not thanks for stopping by and best of luck in finding something that suites you!",

It\u2019s exactly as the title suggested, I\u2019m looking for \\*\\*Transformers plots!\\*\\*Before I jump into the juicer stuff, **please be 21+**.

I\u2019ll answer whenever and as fast as I can :)**\n\n**Who am I?** Now you might be wondering who\u2019s interested in these big (handsome) and fun robots? Well, it is I! I\u2019m Anna, 28, female player, living on easy mode and maybe I\u2019m a bit of a nerd. I also love tea, read books, be social around friends and hoard too many soaps. But who doesn\u2019t love to smell nice?\n\n**Continuities/ words I know:** DW comics (MTMTE, RID, spotlight, and most related content), Prime, RID and some G1\n\n**where do I write?** Email, Discord and Gdocs but I\u2019m open to any suggestion you might have :)\n\n**How I write:** I tend to stick to 3rd person in the past tense but am open to trying out present tense posts as well. The length of my posts can vary depending on what works best for us. But if you like a baseline, most of my roleplays tended to have posts around 3-5 paragraphs per post. With some faster paced plots and one-ish paragraph roleplays sprinkled in between. Let me know what works for you\n\n**Shipping:** I\u2019m super open and very excited about most ships. You better ask me what I really don\u2019t feel comfortable with and I would gladly give you a list. I will be adding a list of muses/bots/character I prefer to write and if you have a ship involving any of them I\u2019d probably say yes right away, haha.However, to be fair and not to get anyone\u2019s hopes up.**I\u2019m not really into human x mech ships** and probably won\u2019t go for any plot related to those.\n\n**Muses/bots/character I prefer to write In no order of interest:** Jazz, Prowl, Rodimus/Hot Rod, Rewind, Chromedome, Whirl, Optimus/Orion, Drift, Skywarp, Megatron, Barricade, Thunderhoof, Steeljaw, Bumblebee, smokescreen, Getaway, Sunstreaker, Knock out, Breakdown, Skids, Brainstorm, Fulcrum, Mirage, Wheeljack, Blurr, Nightbeat, Starscream\n\n**Oc\u2019s:** I love Oc\u2019s! If you wish to play with those instead I\u2019m totally cool with that as well.\n\n**General roleplay stuff:** In general I just love writing and creating plots. Canon, Canon-divergence, AU\u2019s and/ or human AU\u2019s are all welcome. I\u2019m open to light, sweet and fluffy, something dark and gritter. Some hurt and comfort, humour, a combination of all of those and much more. In the end I just want to write about big robots and something we both enjoy writing on!",

Like something in the vain of the Hunger Games, but with more of a twist! \n\nI'm open to all ideas and would love to come up with something we'll both enjoy!\n\nI'll also go ahead and say that I can (and probably will) play multiple different characters!

Despite the bad reputation the individual and collective fanbase of these shows have given them, I still believe something wonderful can come out of either a Sherlock, Supernatural, or Doctor Who roleplay. I'm aiming for something individual, but if multiple people show interest, I would love to start a discord for a shared universe if everyone was willing to. Below I'll list my preferred characters, what I offer, and what I'm looking for.\n\n||OFFERING||\n&gt; Having roleplayed since the beginning of last decade (happy new year btw) I consider myself a literate roleplayer, very descriptive when it comes to world building and consider character progression to be my speciality. I love to go in depth with my characters emotions and will seldomly give a mediocre response (we all have our bad days, right?). That being said, I also enjoy the occasional one-liners and goofiness for any character. \n\n&gt; Availability. I have a full time job, but I have a phone with steady internet connection and lots of dead time through the day. The more enticing the plot, the more I'll look for chances to respond.\n\n&gt; Flexibility. I can and will roleplay more than one character if you'd like me to, ranging from canon to oc's (of which I have a lot to spare). \n\n&gt; Friendship? I guess? Or we can stay completely focused on business if you'd prefer. I'm game either way. \n\n\n\n||SEARCHING||\n&gt; Someone willing to build a plot with me and not drop all the load for me to bear.\n\n&gt; Willingness to do something beyond just romance. I adore romance, but also crave platonic relationships. \n\n&gt; A flare for the dramatic. Character deaths, fights, love triangles, I love all of the angst. \n\n&gt; 18+. I'm 22 and wouldn't feel comfortable role-playing with someone much younger than me. \n\n\nAnd now that's all been laid on the table, the characters I'd like to play are the following (strong preference marked with a star), but I'm not limited to only this list:\n\nSherlock:\nJohn Watson (no Johnlock though) / Irene Adler* / Moriarty* / Mycroft Holmes / Molly Hooper\n\nSupernatural:\nSam Winchester / Gabriel* / Crowley\n\nDoctor Who:\n10th Doctor* / Rose Tyler* / Donna Noble* / 11th Doctor / Clara Oswald\n\nI roleplay only in Discord or Reddit, but do let me know even if you use a different platform, if you're interested in any of this please send me a message or answer this post, I'll go in depth to my preferred ships if you want to know about them. I'm so excited!!!",

I really didn\u2019t expect to like this show going into it, but Netflix\u2019s *You* has become my most recent obsession and I\u2019d love a partner to explore it with. Specifically, I\u2019m seeking a stalker character inspired by Joe - someone who justifies their actions, fits in well on the outside, looks a normal part of society, y\u2019know? Canon is welcome, but I\u2019d like to play an OC, and you\u2019re welcome to as well! \n\nAbout me: \n* Consistently reply once a day, usually more often. \n* Match your writing style. Multi paragraph preferred, but sometimes there\u2019s just not a lot to say and a story needs to move along. Let\u2019s just do our best to avoid one-liners! \n* Communicate well outside of OOC - I want to be your friend too! Not necessary, of course, but it makes it more fun, I think! \n* Character pictures, mood boards, inspo - all fun! We can have separate channels and all in a discord server. I love being organized like this. \n* Eastern timezone (GMT -5), 24 years of age, cute dog pictures. \n\nPlease shoot me a PM if you\u2019re interested, and we can chat some details! Really looking forward to creating a fun, creepy story with you!",

            "selftext": "Hello all, \n\nI hope you all had a happy near year and I'm looking for some new RP's. The ones I have are great, but I wish to do something a little different in that I have a Male character I want to play; a Prince in fact. \n\nI do not have a set idea for what I want because I enjoy plotting with people, and coming up with unique stories that way rather than giving everybody a set plot. I am happy to do both realistic, or a completely fantasy setting with dragons, magic and the like just so long as it's medieval. \n\nOf course for the action I imagine there will be some form of drama, whether it be a war or civil rebellion, or an assassination from foreign soil. Maybe two Kingdoms are uniting for political reasons under marriage and neither character wants it. Who knows? \n\nI have a few requests; \n\nI am over 18 and do not wish to roleplay with people under that age for obvious reasons. \n\nLiterate writers only - if you give me two sentences in response to one of my posts, I will discontinue the RP. My posts tend to go over the Discord word limit, doesnt always have to be by hundreds of words, but in some situations it will. Please be able to do the same.\n\nIf there is something wrong with the RP please COMMUNICATE, generally things can be talked through. \n\nI want the OOC connection too rather than what feels like a professional basis in which we just both post but do not discuss things OOC. Having a good relationship between partners is vital. \n\nIf you're interested please feel free to message me! \nI look forward to hearing from you.",

            "selftext": "Hi there!\n\nI recently found myself with an extremely strong craving for a medieval fantasy adventure, where our characters start out on a small quest and get swept up into something big.  I'm talking world building, character development, magic, potentially slow-burn romance, monster-slaying and more!\n\nThis craving came on when I restarted Dragon Age Inquisition (again) and watched The Witcher. I immediately started getting ideas for an original character/world inspired by the both of their similarities.  This includes the Circle of Magi/Brotherhood of Sorcerers (and their fall), the Grey Wardens/Witchers being mutated by potion/blood, anti-magic sentiments, etc.\n\nA quick about me: I'm a 29 year old female roleplayer who's been writing for over 15 years. My post lengths varied a lot over the years and do so now - but whether it be two paragraphs or eight, I always strive for quality.  That being said, I honestly don't know what category I would fit in so feel free to request a sample of my writing.\n\nMy preferred mode of discussing RP is Discord and Gchat.\n\nFeel free to message me with any questions!",

            "selftext": "Hey there! My name's Alan, and with the finale of the Skywalker Saga, I think it's time to get our Star Wars RP on! I'm a pretty big geek when it comes to the Star Wars universe, and I would appreciate anyone who might message me to be one as well. It's a lot more enjoyable to me when we can both geek out on Star Wars lore and really set up an interesting story. I am partial to the Clone Wars era, mostly because I'm a prequel baby, but I also find the Clone Wars a very interesting time period. I'm fine with any of the eras including the Old Republic. I admit I never really got into the old Expanded Universe/Legends (Events after ROTJ), so my knowledge on those stories is very limited. Anything before then or within the new cannon I know like the back of my hand. So if you're a fellow Star Wars geek, and either have a story you've really been wanting to play out, or if you want to create something new, then hit me up. I would very much prefer it if you are literate and capable of writing more than just a few sentences as replies, it just makes everything flow better.\n\nI have a few prompts/ideas written down. They all include plenty of character development, world building, and ideally, a romantic relationship between our two characters. I only do OCxOC roleplays instead of playing already established characters. Though, having canon characters included in the story in passing is perfectly fine, and can add more depth to what's going on. If you have an idea of your own, or would like to read the prompts I have, then send an orange envelope my way. I'd prefer a PM instead of a chat request as I'll probably ignore those. As far as long term communication is concerned, email or Discord are my two primary forms.\n\nI'll list the story ideas I have here, as the actual starter prompts themselves are pretty lengthy. If you find any of these you like then feel free to ask me for the full prompt and I'll send it your way.\n\n* The first story is set in the Clone Wars and follows a Jedi Knight returning to Coruscant after being sent on a mission to explore the Unknown Regions five years before the start of the war. Just before returning back to the Core, he comes across a Force sensitive girl trapped by a Sith worshiping cult. After rescuing her from the cult, he takes her back to the Jedi Temple where she becomes his Padawan. The story would span the entirety of the Clone War with the pair going on various missions together as the Knight gets used to having a Padawan, and the Padawan becomes a Jedi Knight. Ideally this would go up to and perhaps even through Order 66 if a romance develops between the two characters.\n* The second story idea would follow the adventures of a smuggler in Coruscant's seedy underground. Set just after Order 66, he would find a stowaway aboard his ship after escaping a delivery gone wrong. The stowaway, however, would be a Jedi on the run from the newly formed Empire. The smuggler agrees to help the Jedi keep a low profile underground as escaping the planet is all but impossible for her. Through their various adventures surviving the worst conditions and battling against some of the galaxy's cruelest individuals, the two would eventually form an inseparable bond as they learn how to survive in an ever changing galaxy.\n* The third story would entail my character being a Mandalorian bounty hunter. I actually had this idea before The Mandalorian Disney+ show existed, but now that it's out I'm more excited to do something with this. I don't really have a set plot or direction for this, or even time period (though between episodes 3 and 4 would probably work best). If you have an OC of your own that you think would be a great pair with a Mando hunter then let me know.",

            "selftext": "So, I caught your attention. Hopefully I keep it long enough for you to PM me.\n\nA little about me\u2026I\u2019m a 20 something female, in the business of writing a long-term story. I enjoy rom-coms, anything that i can eat with a tortilla chip and the occasional day out on the lake. Im an avid reader and pretty much can spend days with my nose in a good book (or two)! I also like puppies and iced coffee, so I\u2019m pretty basic too.\n\nI\u2019m looking for a literate male, capable of writing a character whom is story-driven, actually has some depth, and whose idea's can keep up with a decent pace of a story line. I\u2019m so sick of the basic plot lines and one dimensional characters, I *literally* cannot. I know this is blunt, but that's sort of who i am. If you're easily intimidated by sass and sarcasm (and can't keep up with it) then I am NOT your girl.\n\nI\u2019m trying to keep this short and sweet, so here\u2019s a quick list off of my stipulations: 18+, not looking for a smut driven plot, experienced in writing (and not just SoL plots, preferably. I want someone who can keep up), able to reply at least once a day, down to OCC chat (because im not a horrible person), isn\u2019t a psychopath, detailed replies, and isn\u2019t a flake.\n\nThat all being said, I can elaborate more if needed. Someone who has a general sense of humor is also nice, sinceI would like to think of myself as funny. I usually write over email or discord...but I can be swayed to another medium with a good enough argument. Except kik. I despise kik.\n\nAs for ideas, I have a few but I'm more interested in creating something with someone than shoving my idea down your throat. All I really want is characters that contrast, possibly even hating each other (at first) but need to work towards a common goal. Honestly, It seems counterproductive to take the time to flesh them out on here, so inquire if you feel you\u2019re up to the challenge. ;)\n\nAnyways. Thanks for reading, hope to hear from the \"one\" soon.",

In terms of concept, I can do anything really as long it's SFW. For example, you can be apart of a human ship on their first venture into deep space, or be one of the species, anything you want. Even a crossover with a franchise like Star Trek is fine (actually that sounds pretty cool.

I'm a literate writer, with multiple paragraphs, leaning toward novella writing. \n- I write exclusively on Discord, we can make a server and write there! I will also write on email or Google Docs if that's the only other option. \n- I get replies in at least every other day but I tend to lean toward once a day. I can get multiple in if time allows but I am *not* a rapid fire writer. I also will tell you if I'm going to stop replying for a while and I hope you do, too.\n- From some bad experiences before, I now only feel comfortable writing with people who identify as female. I also would prefer to write with someone who's 18+, as I'm 25. If you\u2019re a male and can absolutely promise me that you aren\u2019t going to hit on me, try to make a relationship out of our writing, attempt to stalk me or send me NSFW stuff, then okay! \n- I will not write NSFW until I get comfortable with you. Totally willing to write it but we have to have written a bit and be pals first. I do write violence and other themes, so please tell me if anything I'm writing is making your uncomfortable! We can talk about no-nos later. \n- In fandom writing, I double. I'll play any canon your heart desires and I get really excited to write them as best I can. \n- If you send me just \"hey wanna rp\" or just \"hey i saw your post and i'm interested!\" I am not going to reply, I'm sorry.

But such a big history carried with it a darker side, a few of those stars died there, the important people his secrets. Back in its heyday, nothing could affect its popularity. Now in 2019 it was a shell of its former self, requiring impossible care and getting very few checkins. But the worst bit were the ghosts it left behind, literally and figuratively. The people who died there seemed to remain, lingering, waiting for god only knew. \n\nThis idea is based on the shining and American horror story hotel but you don't really need to have seen either to understand what I'm looking for. Please message me for more details.  Im always looking flr partners even if this post gets seen a week or year from now.",

I've posted in this subreddit many times, and have had luck most of the time.  This time I'm seeking a partner for a plot that I have never explored before. Recently, I've gotten into the new installment of Red Dead Redemption, though I was previously interested in it and its wild west themes. I am seeking to play a female OC against a male canon character/OC. The plot is loosely based around the idea of two individuals (likely opposites; i.e. a working class girl &amp; an outlawed cowboy) coming together, falling in love and defeating all odds against them to stay together. Hopefully I can find someone who wishes to play a male canon character from Red Dead Redemption 2. \n\nI prefer to have partners that are 18+, please! I would love to have a partner who I can keep a casual conversation with OOC as well as a serious one IC. I love to chat and get to know my partners personally, so please don't be afraid to open up! \n\nI only play in 3rd person. Please PM me if this role interests you! Thanks.",

(with me being f.) i don\u2019t mind smut or whatever, but we would have to talk beforehand please and thank you. i don\u2019t enjoy anything that isn\u2019t realistic, so keep this in mind. i also care deeply for communication, something i\u2019m learning to work on for myself! i can write over discord, kik, or email. message me with plots or we can brainstorm together if that\u2019s more of your thing! this was messy, my mind is all over the place but! hope to hear from someone soon.",

You may play Comet or another clone, the Coruscant guard may play a role in this as well.\n\n*-[M4A] end of the clone war*\n\n\"a sad day for the galaxy!. Chancellor Palpatine reports the Jedi have betrayed the Republic and has called for a new order. Not long after he discovered a clone division known as the 87th Liberation Division led by Commander Brayec, brother of General Myles has entirely disobeyed Order 66 while aiding the Wookies on Kashyyyk alongside the 41st, in response the 501st has been dispatched to take care of this rebellion while the 41st continue their work. As the final hours of the clone war come to a head, will the 87th survive, or crumble under the might of the new empire\"\n\nIn this I would be playing Brayec, you may play one of the clone characters I have or a clone of your own. Up for discussion! \n\n*-[M4A] original era*\n\n\"Kaminoans unite! 4 years after the end of the clone war the inhabitants of Kamino decide they've suffered enough, they contact and beg for the aid of 3 clones known to have rebelled and gone into hiding to aid them in starting a rebellion against the empire, from then they secretly divert a big enough amount of their incoming clones to undergo secret training to fight the empire! However this goes not go unknown as the Emperor sends Vader's fist alongside Boba Fett to squash this rebellion!\"\n\nA/U of the kaminoan uprising, you can play a clone rebel or storm trooper in this one!\n\n*-[M4F] original era*\n\n\"for years the Empire has reigned strong across the galaxy, traveling the galaxy a padawan of clone war now Jedi travels the galaxy with Ex-Arf trooper Dexx, although their relationship started off rocky, their friendship now holds strong in this galaxy full of Imperial terror\"\n\nFor this I'd be playing Dexx and you his Jedi friend, the story would show them searching the galaxy for a way to reverse the aging serum inside of Dexx. It's a more flexible story than the others.\n\n*-[M4F] original era*\n\n\"terror of Dathomir! 14 years after the end of the clone war a Jedi turned sith has traveled to Dathomir in search for the secret to eternal youth, with the aid of the Empire she leads her own faction of Imperials to secure their treasure, however responding to the call is none other than Brayec, and what is now known as squad 38, a rebel task force comprised of his brothers, uncle and other fighters. how will Brayec feel to see his Jedi General turned Sith Tayra that betrayed them.\" \n\nI will be playing multiple characters for this, you will be playing Tayra who with minimal knowledge on the nightsisters accidentally unleashes a plague which begins to infect her storm troopers as well as some rebellion fighters creating an A/U version of the death troopers. \n\n*-[M4A] post Empire*\n\n\"a moral betrayal! After the fall of the Empire the previously thought dead Boba Felt was captured by Rebellion fighters and was sentenced to death. However, previously unknown to the Rebellion was the family ties Brayec and his 2 brothers share with Jango and Boba. A tie that the youngest of the brothers Joshua cannot look past. Before the execution Joshua frees Boba and marks himself as a traitor to the rebellion!\" \n\nI would be playing Joshua as he makes a decision that lands him a spot on the list of rebel traitors and you any rebel or bounty Josh will eventually go after. I'd like this story to begin with the escape of Boba and Josh and then go into Joshua in his bounty hunter days. \n\n*-[M4A] sequel era*\n\n\"force awakening! Crash landed on the Rishii moon sits the ship of a bounty hunter, inside is it's cargo, an old Storm Trooper who rebelled during the final days of the Empire concealed in carbonite. To which the First Order has discovered. \" \n\nThis one is not as fleshed out but I'm hoping will be interesting! I will be playing Rook, a storm trooper turned rebel who apon discovering his force sensitivity chose to learn and expand upon it, not devoting himself to light or dark. However he was captured by bounty hunters only 3 years after the fall of the Empire, the ship he was frozen in was shot down and crash landed where he stayed until the First Order discovered him. For this you can play any character you'd like!\n\n*thank you for reading! If you have any ideas feel free to share and I hope you were interested by one of the prompts!*",

So I'm not expecting myself to be super sharp on the writing rn.

            "selftext": "I've never run one of these RPs before, but I have a cool plot idea for a sci-fi RP based loosely on an SCP article. I'd love to talk it out with someone and get a group going on a server to go through it!\n\nHere's an intro thing I wrote:\n\n________\n\n&gt;\u201cWe only have to look at ourselves to see how intelligent life might develop into something we wouldn\u2019t want to meet.\u201d\n\n&gt;Stephen Hawking\n\n_______\n\n\u201cCaptain, with all due respect, I can think of about a dozen O-5s who would do goddamn anything to have the opportunity I\u2019m giving you right now. I don\u2019t see why this is so hard.\u201d\n\nThe skipper opted not to meet his superior\u2019s gaze, instead looking out the window of the station at the vast expanse around them. He had been through enough briefings to know there was something Rear Admiral Jones wasn\u2019t telling him. The mission was simple enough: Investigate some space junk near Jupiter. A civilian telescope had spotted something shiny on Io, the spooks couldn\u2019t tell what they were looking at, and there\u2019s apparently too much suspicious debris for a probe to bring back on its own. All the money they started giving the Space Force years ago made it someone\u2019s job to see every shooting star as a potential threat.\n\nStill, it didn\u2019t explain why they were sending the Valhalla, humanity\u2019s greatest spacefaring marvel, to collect space junk. The reactor on that thing could power Los Angeles. There was no way they needed that much power for an orbital retrieval, so what did they need? The size? It was huge, but retrieval missions almost always opted to tow the debris rather than storing it. The only reasons you\u2019d ever risk bringing something like that on board would be for some kind of special analysis that couldn\u2019t be conducted in EVA, or because you needed to protect something. \n\nOr hide something.\n\nGammon figured he didn\u2019t have a choice. If he\u2019d been picked to captain a craft with that many resources on board, it was for a reason, and declining the opportunity wasn\u2019t a real option. The question was a formality. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir,\u201d he finally responded. \u201cIt\u2019s not every day you find out you\u2019re going to Jupiter.\u201d\n\nThe Rear Admiral nodded solemnly. \u201cI understand, son. You\u2019ll have a few weeks to tie up loose ends, and hopefully you\u2019ll be back by Christmas.\u201d\n\nThe Captain stood. Before he could leave, Jones outstretched a hand to him. \u201cWhat you\u2019re doing is very important to us, Captain,\u201d he said, giving a firm, drawn-out shake. \u201cWe really appreciate it.\u201d \n\nGammon couldn\u2019t make out what he saw in the Rear Admiral\u2019s expression in that moment, but it unsettled him to his core.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re doing the Lord\u2019s work out there.\u201d\n\n________\n\nBasically, it's a big spaceship journey to a possibly dangerous location (as if that's never been done before) where we RP as the crew. If that sounds interesting, comment or PM me or whatever :)",

I\u2019m a 22 year old female looking for anyone 18-28 that can play a male character whether you\u2019re actually male, female, non-binary, etc. it doesn\u2019t matter to me what you are in real life. I only roleplay on Discord and only do 1x1 roleplays. \n\nAll my plots are safe for work. I do NOT write smut. My roleplays typically focus on drama and romance with a hint of action depending on the role. I am pretty much advanced lit. Writing anywhere from a couple to multiple paragraphs. I only write in third person. Please be creative when messaging me if you\u2019re interested. All \u2018hi\u2019s and \u2018hey\u2019s will be ignored.\n\nI\u2019m also interested/have ideas in/for things such as Superheroes, witches, vampires, Vikings, and other things. Here\u2019s a whole list of roleplays I currently have plots for:\n\n*She\u2019s the Man* Based on the 2006 movie, a college student has to find a way into an all boys university. It\u2019s a prestige school with much better programs than what is offered elsewhere. With the help of a close friend, she\u2019s able to disguise herself as a male and gets into the school. \n\n*Rivals* I have a few ideas for this one. One resolving around two college aged kids going to the same college, their parents are mafia rivals. Slowly they fall for each other before finding out who they really are. OR we can create some other high school or college rivalry plot. \n\n*Disney Descendants* Very loosely based off the movies. You don\u2019t have to have seen them to play this. It\u2019s about the children of the heroes, princes and princesses soon having to share their campus in a beautiful fictional kingdom with the children of the villains. \n\n*The Contract* the two top young rising celebrities don\u2019t get along at all, for various reasons. What happens when their managers go behind their backs and set the two up on a date? Forcing them to sign a six month contract , claiming to be a couple in the public eye. \n\n*The Vlog* Nothing too crazy is planned out yet. Thinking something along the lines of vloggers/youtubers. \n\n*Fandoms* we can discuss Game of Thrones, Avatar the Last Airbender, Star Wars, and Harry Potter, etc",

I\u2019m just uncomfortable, sorry ): ) but I play both genders. Honestly I\u2019ve started to prefer writing male POVs so that works for me, too. \n\nFor original plots I can either do sci fi or slice of life with some sci fi elements. Fair warning I love pairing antagonists with protagonists. I like romance but I\u2019ve gotta get super comfortable with you to write explicit content and it\u2019ll take a while to get there.

            "selftext": "Hello, and thanks for taking the time to read this! A little bit about myself and my writing style before I get into the nitty gritty. I\u2019m a 19 year old university student interested in writing something in the ATLA or LoK universe. I write in third person past tense and have been writing for just about 7 years. My length very heavily depends on my partner, but I think it\u2019s safe to say when I\u2019m invested I easily hit 3 quality paragraphs. I write on Discord, but if you make a good enough argument I\u2019d be willing to explore other writing platforms. \n\nMy qualifications for my partner, I feel, are rather basic: \n1) Someone who cares. I guarantee I will make mistakes and have days where it\u2019s difficult to write, but I don\u2019t want someone who seems to disregard quality every two or three messages. I also want you to care because being walked away from a week or two in can really suck. I\u2019d like to avoid that. \n\n2) Someone who can communicate. Writing is a two person ordeal, at last the way I do it. I want someone who can tell me how and why they feel a certain way. This is good for brainstorming, general chatting, and even just knowing what to expect from my partner in terms of time commitment. \n\n3) Someone creative. I posted the advertisement, but I can only do so much. I have a few loose ideas rattling around in my head, but I\u2019ll need help in flushing then out! This is another reason communication is so important. \n\n4) Someone active. I don\u2019t require 20 posts a day or anything ridiculous, in fact I have a partner who I\u2019ve taken month long breaks for, but it stinks waiting on a reply for a long time. Writing is something for which I have extreme passion, and I\u2019d like to find someone else who makes an honest attempt at being active. \n\nIf you\u2019re still interested please send me a me a message and tell me your favorite color too!",

Come at me with any canon character from any movie, or even an original character of yours!\n\nMy most detailed and exciting (at least to me) idea involves **Kylo Ren/Ben Solo.** I am completely caught up on the latest film, so if you\u2019d like to talk spoilers, let me know, otherwise I won\u2019t mention it! I'd like a bit of a slow burn romance, could be forbidden or not - I love clich\u00e9s. This can include NSFW as well if you\u2019d like. I\u2019m up for almost anything! My main focus is character development!\n\n* Must be 18+ (both character and OOC) as I am an adult and do not feel comfortable rping this with any minors.\n* I write normally 3+ paragraphs, but I am okay with *at least* 2 paragraph responses.\n* I write strictly in 3rd person and ask that you do the same.\n\nPM me if you're interested, and we can discuss this a bit here and move over to discord!

You may play as an oc, but there's mega bonus points if you wanna be Link :) \n\nMy character lives in Castle Town, but away from the super crowded areas. She works for the Royal Family as a messenger of sorts. Whenever something needs to be delivered, she'll do it herself. She loves to travel and see all of Hyrule for herself. Why not while she's still young? \n\nOne day, she hears of Zant storming the castle but doesn't make it out in time. She watches as her loved ones around her turn into spirits, unable to communicate with her and cry for help. Somehow, my character is not affected. She remains manifested in this world as a tangible, living human. Before she has time to react, she is taken by a Twili beast to a prison. That is where she will meet your character, who has turned into a beast. Why do you feel... Strange around her? Can she turn you back into a human? Can you save the world from the Twili, or will you change it into something else? \n\nStill interested? Great! Heres a few other small notes:\n- I am looking to roleplay on Discord only\n\n- I am 21 years old, so I am looking for someone older than 18\n\n- Unfortunately, I do have a life so I may not respond in a timely fashion. I ask that you be patient with me\n\n- I'm hoping for a possible romantic or close relationship, but that is up to you\n\nThanks all! Looking forward to roleplaying with you :)",

I am looking for at least an 18+ partner. I\u2019ve been roleplaying for fourteen years. I\u2019d really like to stay with Discord but I do have Kik as well. \n\nI\u2019ve had a few partners that I\u2019ve been playing with for a few weeks and suddenly vanishing on me, I am a firm believer in communication and if something isn\u2019t right or your not having fun. Let me know! So if we start and you realize we\u2019re not clicking tell me. Just like I\u2019ll let you know. \n\nI do prefer to use third person, I can do present or past tense. I\u2019m not a fan of first person but I can certainly try. Lol. I like using pictures, to me it helps us both see the same world. It can be NSFW or SFW, I really don\u2019t mind either. \n\nI am looking for a slice of life roleplay. I am up for whatever slice of life that you can think of. Please DM me and lets chat about options before we trade discord or KIK usernames!",

            "selftext": "Hey there people!\n\nI\u2019m currently running a Group RP on Discord with the focus on the crew and their spaceship adventures! Currently there are 5 of us and we\u2019re looking to expand to a maximum of 8 or maybe 9 if you have a friend that really wants to join. The setting we are roleplaying in is handcrafted and appropriate lore channels exist for you to get acquainted.\n\nThe setting takes place 3000 years in the future. Whereas our roleplay begins a 1000 years after some form of galactic apocalypse wiped all known intergalactic civilisation. So that's 4000 in total. The characters start on a half terraformed world that acts as a safe haven and one of the few bastions of civilisation in known space. There after they sign up to an expedition sponsored by corporate entities in said safe haven in hopes of finding out more about what happened to the rest of the galaxy and our roleplay unfolds from there.\n\nCurrently our RP is just getting started, so anyone that joins now hadn\u2019t missed much. That means characters are meeting each other before the expedition begins.\n\nWhat you need to know:\n\n* The setting has deliberate technological limitations in certain areas which can be with enough story progression overcome. This means certain areas might have reverted back to the stone age.\n* This is a low fantasy, semi-realistic roleplay. We \u2013try- to grasp believable concepts. Psionics exist in the setting and are rare. There are consequences to having them.\n* We have a DM that acts as the admin and vets ideas/concepts before they can partake in the roleplay including races (the more expansive your concepts are the longer it takes to get them approved, you will be questioned and bothered thoroughly). Players are sometimes involved in this decision making.\n* You need to be a literate roleplayer, capable of posting at least two sentences on average. Paragraphs preferred. We do not provide an environment for newbies to learn.\n* You need to post in third person.\n\nPlease note the DM works and his timezone is GMT +1 (Europe). If you\u2019re well outside of the range of this timezone and struggle for time, we probably will not be able to accommodate you unless you\u2019re fine waiting around 8 hours for a reply. That said the DM does try to reply whenever it is humanly possible to do so.\n\nWhat we try to provide is:\n\n* An easy going environment with literate roleplayers. NSFW and meme channels included.\n* A news section where you may be able to read about actions of your characters from an outside perspective.\n* A setting where the DM will do most of the \u201cscience\u201d thinking for you and offer explanations within RP when necessary, in case this is something that inconveniences or otherwise confuses you. So you can keep on roleplaying without second guessing yourself.\n* A sprawling Sci Fi setting that keeps getting lore updates as the roleplay unfolds.\n* A balanced approach to the general themes of the RP without a strong fixation on one thing or the other.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested or have any questions, leave a comment or PM me for more details.",

            "selftext": "The Spark is aching for the light\n\nReturn, return, return tonight\n\n\\- Sylvan Esso, \"Funeral Singers\"\n\n# \u2727Please don't comment here, PM me if you want to communicate about anything written below.\u2727\n\nHello there! I go by Hannah and I am an experienced, **advanced literate** cis female writer looking for a **female** (NB and non-cis individuals also welcome) long-term writing partner interested in filling the **male** roles in the narratives we dream up. Someone eager to help me create worlds and breathe life into characters that we fall irreparably in love with. I want depth and beauty and drama and writing so delicious you could die. I'm not asking for much, just that special magic that can happen rarely when two talented minds meet a blank page and tackle it together.\n\n# The big compatibility stuff/my preferences:\n\n**\u2661** I have been doing RP/one on one writing in some capacity or another for **\\~nineteen years**. It's why I can write to what I humbly believe to be at least a **somewhat decent** level. Being able to write every single day for months on end for more years of my life than not has given me invaluable experience in character creation, development, world-building, narrative, all of it.\n\n**\u2661** I mention this because I would very much prefer it if you are also on the more **advanced literate** side of the 'Semi-lit&gt;Literate&gt;Advanced literate' spectrum in your writing. I ask that you are fairly experienced, with a firm grasp of spelling, grammar, and storytelling. I **don't** ask that you be perfect, I am a **better storyteller** than I am at grammar and punctuation and all that, for example. But I like to hope that my grasp on everything else makes up for it. I'm gonna make glaring mistakes because the words were just rushing out too fast and I was blinded by the vision of the scene and the things I was trying to convey, but I do try my best, and that's all that I am asking of you.\n\nAll that to say again, we're both human, perfection isn't being sought here, but just write good, k?\n\n**\u2661** **I am only interested in female writing partners.** NB and non-cis individuals **of course** also welcome.\n\n**\u2661** I do **only** play female main characters, and I understand if that is frustrating to you, but that is also my preference. If you don't enjoy playing the main male roles, **do not PM me**. I'm not about asking anyone to do anything they don't want to do. If you don't want to or have hesitations...please don't.\n\n**\u2661 All characters must be above the age of eighteen.**\n\n**\u2661** I type much more **casually** in direct conversation via IM/DM, I **overshare** and brainstorm ideas constantly and will flood your messages if you're away with them.\n\n**\u2661** I am **only** interested in **hetero** pairings for our mains.\n\n**\u2661** From time to time I may be interested in F/F pairings of side characters or side characters with my main, and this is about as close to \"doubling\" as I get. This is not a requirement, however. Just something I am open to if it fits the story and both parties are interested.\n\n**\u2661** I prefer **GDocs/E-mail** for the actual writing and **Discord** for ooc chatter and brainstorming. I will bow to pressure if you ONLY use discord servers and you seem like a good potential partner, but I **don't** love the character limitations on there.\n\n**\u2661** I **\\*really\\*** am not comfortable working with anyone younger than around **\\~22+** Like, I have **zero** interest and it'll be a flat **no** from me. Sorry.\n\n**\u2661** I don't know if this is a given, but I also ask that you **help** me populate the **side-characters** as needed for our world and our stories.\n\n**\u2661** I **do not** match **post length** just for the sake of it. I will always try and give as much as I possibly can in a post, but if we need to advance forward, or the post for whatever reason didn't give me a ton to work with or it's mainly dialogue, my reply will be shorter.\n\n**\u2661** **I do not like pre-made characters**. I expect that **all** characters used in our stories are made expressly for those stories. I don't want to hear \"Oh, I have a character that will fit this story.\"\n\n**\u2661** I write in **third person past-tense POV only**.\n\n**\u2661** I **only** use actors and models for **character references**, and I consider character references **necessary**.\n\n**\u2661** **I do not fade to black**, though I do not want those scenes to be the main focus. I welcome them when they are natural and fun, but my focus is story-telling **\u2661**\n\n**\u2661** SO yeah, just to make it a bullet point, I prefer **long-term** writing partners. We can certainly do **one-offs** for cravings, and leave and come back to stories and worlds and plots as we please, we are after all in charge, but I prefer to have one or two steady people I can turn to when I want to work on something either creatively for a few months or to satisfy a craving in the moment that may or may not turn into something long-term we work on or come back to, and to be that person for someone else as well.\n\n**\u2661** I **don't** tend to like playing **canon characters**. I will take ideas from characters and build something new around that, something similar, but still mine. I will also do this with settings, worlds, drawing from TV and movies and comics and books, etc. But I will never play a canon character and for me to play opposite one, as in you playing a canon character, would have to be a huge crave or a lot of convincing and pretense and plot that I like. It's rare, but not 100% unprecedented. (I was DYING for a Punisher RP as soon as season one on Netflix came out, for example.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Take a look at what I am interested in actually writing just below, and if you find your interest piqued further and want to delve into any of these worlds with me and create some characters, get right into it and start brainstorming and seeing if we vibe, please send me a PM. Introduce yourself. If you have writing samples, send them. If you have questions, ask them. Ideas? Tell me them. \u2661\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# \u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\n\n# If you think we would mesh well together, inquire about ideas I have in your introductory PM and we can discuss and I can elaborate.\n\nI love playing around in different decades. Anything from the 1800s and on is fair-game for dabbling in historical or just a more vintage time period to play around with. I'm open to mixing some of the ideas I have here with a different decade setting. I will usually mention a range of decades I find appealing per story/idea.\n\n# CURRENTLY CRAVING -\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe amount of \u2661's denote level of interest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Mainly Slice of Life right now!\n\n**\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661 Slice of life/Love-story**\\- I love creating character-driven stories that are just that, love stories in what is largely a slice of life story. That's not to say that I like SOL that is boring. There is still plenty of room to incorporate emotion and drama and layer on depth wherever we can. Some of my favorite stories have been anywhere from about 65 to 85% SOL, with the other percentages made up of action and conflict. (Possible decades: 60s-90s, modern - Not interested in fantasy or sci-fi for this genre.)\n\nI want to tell a love story above all else. I think most of us do, at the heart of our stories. There are certainly exceptions, but I am not one of them. I am a fiend for a good love story. Star-crossed lovers, etc.\n\nI want to make something that is gritty and real and includes both the good and the bad that comes with a realistic, intense relationship between two people who love each other even when it hurts. I want to include the fights but also the making up. The character development as they grow and change and age, and the ways that can cause friction between two people or even the people around them. The pain and the drama right alongside the joy and happiness. A story about a family. A story sometimes about love, sometimes about loss and grief, sometimes about two people just trying to make it work because they know it's meant to, and they know no matter what they want each other in their life forever. They're family even when they're not together, and because I believe in happy endings, we can rely on the knowledge they belong together even when they're not for certain lengths of time.\n\n**Love. Marriage. Intensity. Loss. Pain. Grief. Having children/Not having them. Family. Loyalty. Betrayal. Dedication. Realism. Mental health issues. Health. Relationships.**\n\nAnd all in between and before and after, drama and love and passion and maybe even dependency on substance and/or people outside of the marriage for one or both of them. I want to go there and get deep into the ways a marriage can both hurt and be amazing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have a couple of main ideas that I want to play off of. Some characters, settings, pairings, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first one is something a little **Mad Men-esque** in that we set it in the early 60s and pair my character, a young woman who is an artist and a free spirit, with a middle-aged man with a wife and two children. Maybe a doctor or professor instead of an ad man though. Don Draper-ish, in the best ways, but not too much because he could be a *real* dog at times. An intense love story that kind of comes out of nowhere and is real and not just for the fun of it. At least not after a while. Maybe at first, but then it's more and it's real and it's painful and beautiful like real love is. I picture my character would be from Montauk, someone he'd meet on vacation, someone unlike anyone he's ever known. Like a breath of fresh air.\n\nThe other, if you're not into something set in the 60s, would be maybe something more modern with an older single father who has full custody of a child from a previous relationship. He'd have a tough relationship with his ex or maybe he's a widower.\n\n**Fiona Gallagher** \\- Keep in mind that this character type can be worked into several different ideas I have, and so is more just the idea for the character and her situation. At any rate - I would like to create a character who is a lot like Fiona in her situation with being responsible for her siblings and household. I'd ideally pair her with a wealthy older guy, or a Jimmy-Steve sort of guy around her age, but without all the dishonesty and secrets. If you haven't watched this show, my idea is also easily explained as it has nothing to do with the actual show and I just want to borrow the overall premise and make it our own. (Possible decades: 60s-present - Not interested in fantasy  or sci-fi for this.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot slice of life but also would consider the following with an **eager** potential partner:\n\n**\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661 RDR/The Revenant/Western US in the mid to late 1800s**  \\- The overall gist is pretty simple, delving into a love story set in the wild west, but I think this could be really fun and amazing if we slapped some good writing on it. We'd be dabbling in some historical fiction, which I love, and using OC's. I mention the specific media examples listed as reference for vibe/setting only, though I am certainly not opposed to borrowing themes from any source. I'd be interested in maybe doing something with a band of outlaws a la RDR2, maybe trappers a la The Revenant. We could eventually have some homesteading, and there's a lot of room for action and drama and slice of life elements all mixed in together, and for some more robust side-characters if we choose to develop them. I'm on my second playthrough of RDR2 and it's so immersive and expansive that I can't help but be inspired and want to reflect that in a story all our own.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese are just rough thoughts about plots and character and any ideas I have listed would need to be developed a lot more, of course, but I truly love that kind of collaborative development of plot and characters, so that's fine by me. I prefer to leave things as more of a loose skeleton without fleshing everything as far as plot and narrative out tooooo much, because I like for the characters to kind of help to illuminate the way as we go. Brainstorming and sharing ideas is great, plotting things to death and down to the very last detail isn't much fun for me though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# \u2661 No matter what kind of world and characters we work in and with, I want a heavy, character-driven, unforgivably human type of story that will ultimately reward us with a beautiful narrative and characters that feel real and alive. Hopefully a friendship and/or writing partnership. Maybe the start of a whole new world we can dabble and play in at our leisure. That's always my hope.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want beauty and heartache and drama and love and yeah, I want a little magic but not in the fantasy sense of the word. I want the magic of two creative, talented minds working together for a common goal and breathing life with words. I want a nice slow to medium-burn of a love story to start out hopefully many lovely stories we can tell together. There are universes to be made.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**If any of this sounds good to you, please don't hesitate to PM me and we can go from there. Most of the above can be worked out.**\n\n# \u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\n\n# Bonus rambling:\n\n\u2661 Usually having the male main character at least a couple of years older than the character I am playing will end up being my vibe. I like to make female characters that challenge and assert against men who might consciously or unconsciously use age as an excuse to dismiss or otherwise silence or stifle them at the beginning, or if they're not the type sometimes also perhaps to use that juxtaposition of age and character for fun because of some of these societally pre-conceived notions, etc.\n\n\u2661 Taking breaks for burnout is totally fine, I will probably take a couple over the course of say, a year, and that's why I prefer having long-term partners. Ditching though, I don't appreciate and try not to do myself. Just let me know, I get it. We're human beings with lives and mental and physical health needs. Or maybe we just aren't meshing? Don't sweat it, just tell me. I will certainly try and do the same.\n\n\u2661 I can get **very** into world, mood and character building and have in the past collaborated on playlists, character references, setting reference, mood boards, etc. with writing partners to help expand on the world based on the mood, using these things as a way to further get on the same page so we can write in both the same tone and from the closest that I think two minds can probably get when working on one world together from two totally different upbringings, sometimes writing styles, background, history, experience, mood, locations in the world, etc. There are a lot of variables, but I feel like discussing characters and setting and vibes and themes you want to include and songs that make you think of a character or a moment or a feeling related to the story and all of that can level some of those variables and bring two people to the same place creatively. It's magic when it happens, and if you've experienced it you know it, and I guess that's what I am looking for again. A little magic, no big deal. Right?\n\n\u2661 I like to tell stories that can sometimes span generations. Maybe even time and space. But most important, stories about families and characters that feel real and who come to life for us. I like having things that I write with long-term writing partners eventually be woven together in some way or another, so that it's a cohesive world, even if in one story we're dabbling in Science Fiction and then in another maybe historical fiction or slice of life or anything in-between. I love doing stuff like that and being collaborative about world-building and borrowing characters and adding generations and ancestors and relatives to families as we go and as the opportunity arises no matter the genre or era we are writing in. I've yet to meet a plot line I can't at least loosely tie together.",

Because let\u2019s admit it, when she was younger\u2026.I think I\u2019ve questioned my sexuality once again.))\n\nSpecies: Human/Asgardian hybrid. \n\nSkin/Fur Tone: A pale pink-ish color. She has a beauty mark beneath the middle of her left eye. \n\nHeight: 5\u20199 (usually others would assume she\u2019s taller).\n\nHair appearance: Her hair is platinum blonde. It\u2019s wavy and usually worn down. Mackenzie doesn\u2019t really like to straighten it or do things with it very often, unless she puts it into a braid that\u2019s her only go-to.\n\nEye Color: Grey with deep oceanic blue flecks mixed in.\n\nClothing: Mackenzie prefers to wear more comfortable clothing. Most notably, she wears a black tank top with jeans, red flannel around her waist, and a choker. She likes wearing converse sneakers or boots. Usually she wears a thick gold and red ribbon her father gave her, which is on her wrist or she uses it once in a blue moon.\n\nTattoos: None.\n\nPiercings: None.\n\nScars/Flaws: A bandage on her nose. \n\nAlternate Clothing: A black zip-up hoodie underneath a gray tank top, and sweats with converse sneakers. Sometimes, she wears her headphones.\n\n  \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550. \u22b1\u22c5\u22c6\u02da.\u00b0\u273f\u00b0.\u02da\u22c6\u22c5\u22b0.\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\n\n                 \u275dUncle Loki is a creep.\u275e\n\n                      \u22c6\u02da.\u00b0Preferences\u00b0.\u02da\u22c6\n\nSexuality: Bisexual with a lean towards women, or sometimes equally.\n\nLikes: Mackenzie absolutely adores dogs. Because of Loki, however, Mackenzie has a distinctive fear of snakes. She loves chocolate, bubblegum, and french fries. Mackenzie has a distinctive love for My Chemical Romance, Daft Punk, and Black Veil Brides, but she absolutely hates overly-upbeat music. She also loves the color blue and the color purple. She also prefers tea over coffee any day.\n\nDislikes: Mackenzie doesn\u2019t like coffee because she\u2019s afraid it\u2019ll stain her teeth. She also dislikes dark chocolate. Despite her personality, she actually dislikes fighting quite a bit because of her family. She also dislikes the idea of marriage and kids because she doesn\u2019t feel as though she\u2019s the family type. She hates puns because she finds them annoying. The last thing on the last would have to be long dresses and skirts. Mackenzie can be somewhat clumsy, so she\u2018d rather not trip on the ends. She hates light pink and white, though. \n\nHobbies: Mackenzie plays guitar. Aside from that, she doesn\u2019t really have any other hobbies aside from hitting things with knives.  \n\n                 \u275dHOLY- IT\u2019S A PUPPY!\u275e\n\n  \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550. \u22b1\u22c5\u22c6\u02da.\u00b0\u273f\u00b0.\u02da\u22c6\u22c5\u22b0.\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\n  \n       \u275dHEY!

She can be a bit of a dick when it comes to people in general, even if it isn\u2019t on purpose. She isn\u2019t much for conversation. She doesn\u2019t have social issues, but rather prefers not to talk very much. Mackenzie doesn\u2019t trust anyone very easily, but sometimes ends up trusting the wrong people. She doesn\u2019t have the best sense when it comes to trust. She can be friends with just about anyone, though, regardless of gender, race, sexuality, or anything like that.. To her, it shouldn\u2019t matter what\u2019s on the outside that makes a good friend. \nMackenzie is a bit more laid-back than most people. She isn\u2019t one to stress out over anything very easily unless the situation is really tense. She tends to stick to herself in school and in public, so it\u2019s rare for her to get into a fight. She makes fairly normal grades aside from math class. \nMackenzie has trouble hiding her feelings and rarely understands them. She often fails to do so and usually goes to her older cousin for comfort when she can no longer hold back her emotions. She isn\u2019t the best at comforting others, but will still try. As much as she says she hates them, Mackenzie would love nothing more than a hug when upset. \n\n            \u275dI need a twelve-hour nap...\u275e\n\n  \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550. \u22b1\u22c5\u22c6\u02da.\u00b0\u273f\u00b0.\u02da\u22c6\u22c5\u22b0.\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\n\n           \u275dOh hell...

Of course, she views the invulnerability to human sickness as a downside since she can\u2019t miss school or lie about being sick. As for the Allspeak, she tends to fluctuate more frequently between Spanish, Portuguese, and English. \n\nPhysical Abilities: Mackenzie, being partially Asgardian, is incredibly strong. However, she is not as strong as most may be.\n\nWeapons: Mackenzie has a few daggers, but she doesn\u2019t really need to use them very often. \n\n                         \u275dOh hell no.\u275e\n\n  \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550. \u22b1\u22c5\u22c6\u02da.\u00b0\u273f\u00b0.\u02da\u22c6\u22c5\u22b0.\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\n\n                 \u275dSUCK ON A ROCK!\u275e\n\n                       \u22c6\u02da.\u00b0Backstory\u00b0.\u02da\u22c6\n\nMackenzie had a semi-normal life apart from her Asgardian heritage. While her family does tend to fight quite a bit, Mackenzie just blocks it out. She considers it normal for families to fight because she\u2019s seen it all too often for it to not seem that way. \nWhile Mackenzie has only been to Asgard once, she can\u2019t decide whether she prefers Midgard or Asgard. She adores New York\u2019s noisy, bustling nature. The sound of cars rushing by during the night would be something she just couldn\u2019t sleep without. She cares deeply for her mother, but doesn\u2019t know very much about her father due to how busy he is. She knows he cares, though. \n\n  \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550. \u22b1\u22c5\u22c6\u02da.\u00b0\u273f\u00b0.\u02da\u22c6\u22c5\u22b0.\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\n\n

Our active group of five is looking to add excited, long term members to our story. We will work with you to create a character that has preexisting connections to the story at-large if you wish, and we are always here to help answer questions about this time in history. \n\nWe have had a lot of interest in the past when looking for a single new member at a time, but even though we are opening the group, we are not looking to grow it for the sake of numbers. We really want to write with other people who enjoy the rp like we do. We describe it as having multiple 1-1 partners in the same world rather than a group rp.\n\nWe write mostly adv. lit and like to plot how character stories weave into one another a bit. Friend and message me on discord if you have questions: SoggyJane#7060  \n\n\n# Since the war, things have been looking up, and while many of those living in the city lost a lot before, they're hopeful for their chances now. Gangsters run the city while crooked cops fit right into their pockets, and all the effort toward Prohibition stirs opportunities to supply the undiminished supply for alcohol all around Manhattan. Detectives find their days full of corruption cases and covered murders, and jazz takes center stage on every night of the week. Immigration peaks in the dawning of organized crime, and radio and cinema are accessible to nearly everyone. \n\n# The world is changing, and it begins the rein of the clever and the corrupt. \n\n \\+Literate, Third Person, Past Tense \n\n\\+Long Term RP \n\n\\+Relaxed 7 day activity limit \n\n\\+Optional adult channels  \n\n\\+Engaging world that you help shape \n\n\\+Helpful people\n\n For more info review our information: [shorturl.at/twD39](https://shorturl.at/twD39)\n\nOr join and check out the information and chat with us about your questions: [https://discord.gg/z42TEd4](https://discord.gg/z42TEd4)",

            "selftext": "Trigger warning for mentions of War, Torture, and indoctrination  \n\n\u269c\ufe0e PLOT \u269c\ufe0e\n\n[BC] \u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u269c\ufe0e\u265a\u269c\ufe0e\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\n\nMuse A (Me) was very well known but, not for very good reasons. You see, muse A is the general of a ruthless army that\u2019s known for their extreme tactics and brutal efficiency all in the name of bringing about a new era of order and peace. Almost everyone knows who muse a is, the horrible things they have done, how skilled they are at whatever weapon they like the most, how they have no mercy and will either kill you in matters of seconds or torture you until you\u2019re begging for death. they\u2019re cold, they\u2019re calculating, rumor has it they lack a heart and soul. The thing that makes them really dangerous though is that they believe in everything their army stands for, they\u2019d been raised to believe in it. They think that what they\u2019re doing will ultimately cause a better world for everyone. So what it to get to that goal a little blood must be shed? In their mind the only thing that was standing between their ultimate victory and the peace that would follow is a pesky little resistance that keeps foiling his plans and everything he\u2019d worked for. \n\nMuse B is a part of said resistance and is in fact one of the best soldiers there. They joined the resistance as soon as he could and quickly climbed the ranks to become a commander. After that they were offered another promotion though they decided that it wasn\u2019t their place to be in a command center mindlessly ordering troops in the field. No, they wanted to be out there fighting for what they believed in. For years they\u2019d managed to execute mission after mission against the enemy successfully, even becoming such a big problem for them that a price was put on their capture. They didn\u2019t worry about this, thinking that they were to resourceful and clever to get caught. That was until they got caught. \n\nMuse A could\u2019ve have been happier when news of Muse B\u2019s capture reached their ears and they were quick to order them to be taken to an interrogation room so they can get information about the resistance out of them. Muse B refuses to give in, much to the frustration of Muse A.  In a desperate attempt to see what makes this pilot so determined and unwilling to break Muse A decides to go visit Muse B themselves. Really, it was a bad idea from the start. \n\nMuse B, being as resourceful as they are managed to break out of the handcuffs that had been put on them but still pretends to be trapped. As muse A enters the room and starts to talk and interrogate Muse B the base they\u2019re on suddenly gets attacked. Muse B recognizes who it is that came into their room and decides that Muse A would make a great hostage. When the base is attacked Muse B takes the chance to overpower and kidnap Muse A, with the full intention of bringing him back to the resistance base to use for ransom and information. In order to do this they Hijack a plane from the hangar on the base and forgo\u2019s the usual safety checks to assure a quick escape. \n\nAfter only a few hours of flying the plane starts to make weird noises and beeps. As good of a pilot as Muse B is they can\u2019t figure out what\u2019s wrong with the plane and what\u2019s worse is that they lost track of where they were. It isn\u2019t long before the plane spirals out of control and ends up crash landing in a strange place that\u2019s foreign to both muse\u2019s. It\u2019s a miracle that neither of them were majorly hurt in the crash but now they have a new problem. They need to find a way to survive together in a new place while trying not to tear each other\u2019s throat out in the process. Will they manage to survive or will their differences prove to much for them to overcome?\n\nRules: \n1) Please be able to hit the character limit on most platforms. You don\u2019t have to hit it every time but I would appreciate if you could do multiple paragraphs per response. \n2) please role play in the third person \n3) If you don\u2019t like something in the plot please talk to me about changing it! Discussion and communication \n4) please play a character that fits the description I have.\n5) Have fun and please pm me if you\u2019re interested!",

            "selftext": "Hello, you can call me Doe! I'm in my 20s, a student, and a proud cat mom. I write multiple paragraphs/novella style (200-500+ words). I love to write detailed descriptions and delve into a character\u2019s head/emotions as well as surroundings. I compare it to writing a novel together.\n\nI understand if the scene doesn\u2019t have alot going on and therefore requires less like rapid fire. I adore having long, thoughtful replies where we truly immerse ourselves in the world. I'm hoping to find a partner whose as enthusiastic and passionate about the plot and writing as I am. When I get invested in a story, it\u2019s 100% dedication. Getting a reply is the highlight of my day.\n\nI'm a big fan of romance and using face claims. I\u2019m the type to make pinterest boards, spam you with gifs, headcanons, and send you songs that remind me of our characters and/or ship. I'll get excited if we come up with a great plot idea or if our characters are being cute or going to get into trouble. I live for this kind of stuff honestly.\n\nLast but not least I only do MxF (with myself in the female role) and don\u2019t double, but I\u2019m more than happy to write side characters of either gender to help move the story along. I'd highly prefer female authors writing male characters. Male authors, please stop contacting me. I've been burned too many times. If you persist, I'll ignore your message. Sorry!\n\nDesperately Searching For\n\n- 21+ partners\n\n- For you to have an excellent grasp of grammar, punctuation, spelling, and capitalization. Both in character and out of character. (Literate to advanced writers only, please. I'm not looking for newbies).\n\n- The more description, the better! I'm looking for someone can write as much as me (2 to 4 paragraphs or more) and really bring the story to life. I lose interest if I'm the only one that's invested/enthusiastic or coming up with plot ideas. Quality writing makes my heart happy, as does world building together.\n\n- The use of real life face claims and joining me in the wonderful world of ship/character development isn't a requirement but I'd sure be delighted if we were on the same page in this regard. (I won't use anime faces, only realistic art if you're uncomfortable with real life)\n\n- Someone who won't leave without warning or explanation after sending the first post. I'm looking for the long term here, and I have been greatly saddened by how many partners have left me high and dry recently.\n\nIf you've made it this far, thank you! You won't be disappointed in writing with me. I tend to be online daily and I'd like it if you were too. Please let me know if you're going to be inactive, long days/weeks of silence make me nervous.\n\nOriginal Genres:\n\n- Mafia/Crime\n\n- Post Apocalyptic/Dystopia\n\n- Supernatural/Modern Fantasy\n\n- Southern/Mid-Western/Urban Gothic\n\n- Modern Mythology/Fairytale Retellings\n\n- Sci-fi\n\n- Superpowers/Gifted\n\n(I also have an original Star Wars plot in mind if anyone's interested) \n\nAll my characters will be adults and I require my partners to do the same, as there will be adult themes in my writing. For more plot and more genre ideas, message me ^^ I prefer to write over email but can use discord for chatting and writing, along with google docs.\n\nPlease be detailed when you message me, let me know why you chose to contact me. Seeing only \"hey do you wanna rp?\" is a guaranteed way to turn me off.\n\nLook forward to hearing from you!",

            "selftext": "Hiya! I hope everyone is having a good new year. My resolution this year is to get more stories going. I've been roleplaying for around 8 years now and recently it's been pretty slow. Now, I have an idea that I think some of you will like. I'm looking for someone willing to write in the third person. You also need to be able to withstand a little gore/horror. This plot is pretty modular so if you want to change an aspect then just let me know. Discord is my go-to. I also like to send reference photos of scenery or outfits. I know this is a pet-peeve to some. I just browse Pinterest in my free time and see a lot of cool shit.  I'd also like to incorporate a little romance.   \nThe Plot  \nWe are apart of a top-secret agency. The agency is assigned with documenting and securing everything from extraterrestrial to extradimensional. Whether it's a simple ghost or a man who undergoes the entire life cycle within 75 minutes, the agency documents and secures. Hiding the anomalies from the public. The powers that be must band together to save the world and protect it from the truth.   \nI plan to have an overarching storyline. An anomaly that keeps appearing which may cause the end of the world. If you're familiar with SCP then you can tell that's what I'm trying to do here. The only reason this isn't an SCP RP is that I'd like to be able to include those who don't know the lore. Plus I'm trying to do something a little different here. I'm thinking about adding some fantasy aspects. Our characters could have special abilities that help us with securing these anomalies  \n If you have any questions or interests, feel free to message me and we can get a story set up. Looking forward to hearing from you!",
