            "selftext": "This is going to sound silly, but I had a dream the other night and it inspired me to make a story out of it. This roleplay idea is still a bit rough so any additional ideas are welcome, of course. I am over 18, so please be as well as this may involve adult themes such as violence, discrimination, triggering scenes, etc. I write in 3rd person and usually write at *least* 2 - 4 paragraphs or more per post.  \n\nI'm not very great at conveying my ideas outside of RP, so please bear with me. \n\nThis story takes place in a modern-ish world. A decade or so ago, Fae came out of hiding and introduce themselves to humans. As a token of faith, mortals were given a particular Fae herb that gives them the ability to see through their glamour.  \n\nMost of the population now know Fae to be real, while other 'mythical' creatures are still seen as fiction (this doesn't mean that they don't exist). While the Fae have tried to make themselves helpful, there are still many people who view them as 'monsters'. Political parties were formed around the idea of keeping the Fae out of 'human' countries and, currently, there are multiple debates on whether or not a magical being can be considered human which would afford them the same rights as everyone else. As this hatred for Fae grew, many of the creatures tried to go back into hiding, but it's nearly impossible now that humans have the ability to see through their glamour. \n\nFae children are the hardest to distinguish from humans. While some of them have the markings of magic (scales, wings, antlers, etc), most of them look completely normal. When a Fae reaches 16 years of age, they begin to go through a transformation, at which point their magical element begins to take form. This transformation is different for each Fae. Some get taller, some grow wings, while others can end up looking completely different than they were before. \n\nMy character is a Fae who was given to a human couple when she was just a baby. She's grown up her entire life thinking she was human. She's shy and kind but rather difficult to look at in terms of 'beauty'; however, when her transformation starts, she finds out that not only is she not human, she's unlike any fae who's come before her. \n\nAs for who my partner is, I was thinking you could play another kid from this school who used to bully my character for being shy and 'ugly'. I like the idea that you do this to draw any suspicion away from yourself because you also happen to be in hiding. You don't have to be a Fae; you can be a dragon, demon, werewolf, or make up your own creature. Once she hits 16, my character is forced to leave this school due to transformation. She could come back for reasons, or they could meet somewhere else down the road. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo that's the gist of what I got. I'd love to hear you're ideas, so please send me a message and we can chat about it! \n\nThank you!",

            "selftext": "Hi all! So I\u2019ve had this rp in the back of my mind for a while and decided to see if I could get any bites. First though, here\u2019s some about me:\n\n * 23 Female\n\n * CST\n\n * I work part time, go to school full time.\n\n * I\u2019m not easily offended by anything so anything goes in the rp really.\n\n * I\u2019ve been rping for a while now, like 6 or 7 years I think.\n\n * I\u2019m not a stickler for post length but I usually don\u2019t go over 1 to 2 paragraphs unless the situation calls for it.\n\n\nSo yeah! Onto the rp! If it makes any sense I would love a fluffy rp that has some dramatic moments to make the fluffy bits even fluffier. Basically that means while I largely want this to be a Roleplay that focuses on all the good parts of life, too much of that can get boring so I\u2019d like some stuff to shake it up.\n\nI would largely like this to be a Roleplay about two people coming together to start a family. It could be after they first met, after they\u2019ve been dating/married for a while, I don\u2019t really care. Any time period/genre goes but it will be more slice of life.\n\nNow here are some things I\u2019m looking for in a partner:\n\n * You and your character must be 18+. My character and myself are both older than 18 so no minors.\n\n * I would prefer someone could answer at least a couple times a day. I know life stuff happens, but I want to be able to keep the story going.\n\n * Please have some input into what you want the story to be. When I ask questions and all I get back is \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d It can be rather disheartening.\n\n * I don\u2019t have a post length requirement. I generally write 1-2 paragraphs unless the situation calls for more, but I try to match my partner\u2019s length.\n\nBut yeah! If you\u2019re interested please send me a dm.",

I have to put it in the first paragraph because some people just can't seem to understand English when I put it at the end.\n\nI am looking for someone to play in a world I have created where I will GM or play in a world that someone has created and will GM. If you want me to GM, please play by my rules. Nothing irritates me more than you bending, breaking or doing something that cannot happen in my created world. Asking is fine, but saying something like a throw my pineapple grenade into a building and the building explodes and turn to glass, when I strictly tell you that you only have a chaff grenade really grates my nerves.\n\nNeedless to say, if you know me, I will be throwing luck of the draw and dice rolls to the mix, so if you have experience in DnD or any other table top rp, do state what system or game you play in your message to me.\n\nI'll say this once and once only.

I am a literate and experienced, mature-age roleplayer who has played across multiple platforms including chat, emails and even MMOs. My interests lie in both the small-scale character building and the large-scale worldbuilding that accompanies it.\n\nWhat I am looking for in a partner is somebody similar who has a similar approach to mine. I believe that two way communication is key to success in a RP relationship and that the players should not only engage with each other, but also feel free discuss and suggest plot, story and worldbuilding ideas.\n\nI admit what I have is less a prompt as much a character/story idea that I've been wanting to play for some time. I've been looking to play a Dark Side character; specifically somebody from a background where such was inevitable, such as being a part of the Sith in some incarnation.\n\nThe goal here is to avoid the usual pitfalls that accompany such scenarios that usually see them fall into festivals of stupid evil for the sake of it. What I rather want to do is explore such a character and the environment in which they live, and such things as the balance of duty, obedience, doctrine, free will and the like.\n\nI prefer to play via email or Discord. If you are interested, please **PM** me. I will **not** reply to posts on this thread or chat requests.",

            "selftext": "So little bit about me first before the prompt. I'm 21 year old male who lives in the United States EST. I'm in my final year of college and love writing. My work is usually really slow so I have quite a bit of time to myself. I have taken a few writing classes even though my major doesn't really require me to. I tend to write 3rd person past tense and with multiple characters. I also like discussing the RP OOC as it will usually give me some insight into what direction to go into. You can expect about 1+ paragraph for each response. Sometimes it will be very expansive.\n\nIn a world of unsuspecting individuals there are those among them that posses extraordinary abilities. They walk among humans but they seem like ordinary people but they can do incredible things: enter your deepest thoughts, project dangerous lights from their bodies, move great distances without a single step, move things without touching them, and rival the strength of gods. They are Psyden. Each psyden bears a specific gift. Bruk is the name of those who possess super strength and durability. Teng are those who are telepaths. Vana are people who can teleport and make portals. Cond are those gifted with telekinesis. Elih are those who can manipulate unseen energies. \nThey are also classified by their potency of power. Starting with Shellith (who possess the genetic traits to pass on a gift but show no signs of it). Then Commers (those who possess small signs of powers but can only use them for small use). Indestrad (those who can use their powers for industrial uses). Kobrat (those who are used in the battlefield as powerful weapons). Then prime (those with power of great magnitudes). On the homeworld psyden are groomed from birth for their lifestyles that are well suited to their genetic disposition. A psyden can only posses two of the gifts even though most only have one.\n\nI have a few ideas for stories I want to tell from here. I have a lot of other details to this world that frankly I don't feel like dumping on this post.\nPM for further inquiries.",

I love to write detailed descriptions and delve into a character\u2019s head/emotions as well as surroundings. I compare it to writing a novel together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand if the scene doesn\u2019t have alot going on and therefore requires less like rapid fire. I adore having long, thoughtful replies where we truly immerse ourselves in the world. I'm hoping to find a partner whose as enthusiastic and passionate about the plot and writing as I am. When I get invested in a story, it\u2019s 100% dedication. Getting a reply is the highlight of my day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a big fan of romance and using face claims. I\u2019m the type to make pinterest boards, spam you with gifs, headcanons, and send you songs that remind me of our characters and/or ship. I'll get excited if we come up with a great plot idea or if our characters are being cute or going to get into trouble. I live for this kind of stuff honestly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast but not least I only do MxF (with myself in the female role) and don\u2019t double, but I\u2019m more than happy to write side characters of either gender to help move the story along. I'd highly prefer female authors writing male characters. Male authors, please stop contacting me. I've been burned too many times. If you persist, I'll ignore your message. Sorry!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDesperately Searching For\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- 21+ partners\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- For you to have an excellent grasp of grammar, punctuation, spelling, and capitalization.

I'm looking for someone can write as much as me (2 to 4 paragraphs or more) and really bring the story to life. I lose interest if I'm the only one that's invested/enthusiastic or coming up with plot ideas. Quality writing makes my heart happy, as does world building together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- The use of real life face claims and joining me in the wonderful world of ship/character development isn't a requirement but I'd sure be delighted if we were on the same page in this regard. (I won't use anime faces, only realistic art if you're uncomfortable with real life)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Someone who won't leave without warning or explanation after sending the first post. I'm looking for the long term here, and I have been greatly saddened by how many partners have left me high and dry recently.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you've made it this far, thank you! You won't be disappointed in writing with me. I tend to be online daily and I'd like it if you were too. Please let me know if you're going to be inactive, long days/weeks of silence make me nervous.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOriginal Genres:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Mafia/Crime\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Post Apocalyptic/Dystopia\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Supernatural/Modern Fantasy\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Southern/Mid-Western/Urban Gothic\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Modern Mythology/Fairytale Retellings\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Sci-fi\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Superpowers/Gifted\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll my characters will be adults and I require my partners to do the same, as there will be adult themes in my writing. ***For more plot and more genre ideas, message me*** \\^\\^ I prefer to write over email but can use discord for chatting and writing, along with google docs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease be detailed when you message me, let me know why you chose to contact me. Seeing only \"hey do you wanna rp?\" is a guaranteed way to turn me off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLook forward to hearing from you!",

(Especially, Naruto,Bleach,KHR,BNHA)\n\n-Tv shows and movies, pretty much the same as above with some I really like such as: The Office, Pacific Rim, Lord of the Rings\n\n-Games, sounds like I start repeating myself but the same goes for games though currently a lot of: For Honor, Rainbow Six Siege, Dead by Daylight\n\nComics: Marvel and Dc\n\nI think that covers most of the fandoms, if you want something not on this list, feel free to ask about it!\n\nI prefer roleplaying over Discord.\n\nI'd want to play against a partner that is 18+, for more mature themes, though those themes are not a must in the roleplay.\n\nI think that is about it, feel free to dm me questions or anything you might have and I hope to hear from you :)!",

            "selftext": "Hi everyone, and welcome to my post. I would like to preface this by stating that I am looking for detailed roleplayers only, long or short term, either way, one or two sentences isn't going to cut it. Okay? Awesome.\n\nIt was a baking summers day in the city of ****** when the earthquake hit. Bigger then any quake in decades, 8.9 on the Richter scale, how everyone in the city wasn't crushed beneath the rubble is incredible.\n\nNot that every building had fallen, of course. The quake had struck early on a Thursday morning. Just after 7AM. Few people were in the city that early for work, and most were still tucked up in bed, or enjoying breakfast and coffee when the walls had started to shake.\n\nThey had seen many quakes before, so the majority of the population continued on their day. When the ceilings began collapsing however, they were running and screaming for their lives, many forgetting the earthquake training that had taught each student whilst they were in school.\n\nMany people died. Either lost in the cracks that had split many roads, mangled in car accidents or simply crushed beneath the very houses that were built for shelter. The city got off easier then the suburbs, built stronger and with higher quality materials. Most of the survivors come from these inner city areas.\n\nThieves, drug addicts, gangs, rapists, murderers and every kind of criminal you could imagine. The quake had opened up the city to the scum of the earth, and it was their turn to strut with their heads held high, taking what they please. Pain and pleasure becoming one for these beasts.\n\nNot everyone left is evil though. Many innocents have survived, people on their way to work or school. Maybe jogging or riding a bike, taking the dog for a walk or shopping. However, in a city delved into chaos, who can you trust?\n\nOkay then. That's the basic overview of what has just taken place. Where we're going to take it is up to us, and fully open for suggestions and discussion. I have many ideas ranging from college kids needing to get home across town, neighbors hunkering down in the only remaining building, enjoying each others company as the screams and sirens ring in the distance. Maybe we could even play the scumbag lowlifes, slaying their way across town and taking whatever we want.\n\nBut that's just a couple of very simple ideas. Where would you like to take this?\n\nI look forward to your replies.\n\nMy Kinklist - https://i.imgur.com/cC9fams.png",

            "selftext": "F22 based in Australia so there may be timezone issues (my area is not on fire so we all good)\nlooking for a detailed roleplayer interested  my below roleplay, sorry if its a bit messy but i hope it all makes sense (i encourage questions)\nAs a note Im fine with nsfw topics, but im not looking for ERP, that stuff can be included, but not the focus. My roleplays i prefer to have a no limit when in comes to various topics as im not a fan of censoring myself.\n\nI am really not a fan of heavy romance of slice of life roleplays, i like a bit more conflict and so on. So this roleplay will hopefully not just bubble down into both characters just having to end up together.\n\nSo If you're interested please dm me your discord and any questions.\nPlease dont comment, i have those notifications turned off\n\nROLE ----\n\nPerhaps it was time to find a new approach for this little 'problem' of yours.\nThis was a Modern day Soviet Union, id have you imagine how the world would go if simply one man went about his day a little differently to how it should have, If a meeting ran a little late, would he still be alive?\nThe Soviet union never fell, and it survived into the modern world is the eventual outcome of my story.\n\nA text came in, as you lay in bed the screen lit up and vibrated on the side table, just in time to stop you from drifting back into a sweet dream and the embrace of that ever eluding beauty who called to you. But taking a moment to adjust to the light you looked to find a text from a blocked phone number, \u201cBring 50% of my fee to the alleyway beside the Vishka bar in south city between 11-12 tonight, if you\u2019re late the deal is off.\nThere will be a car waiting for you there, get in it, bring what you can.\"\nThis was it, this contact was what you were waiting for ever since you were prompted to slipping a letter into an unmarked lock box at the moscow crosscountry railway. \nThey were an assassin, an associate told you that they were certainly the best, clean reliable and no strings attatched, but they were also one of those.... things.\n\nRemember what I said about what might happen when a man does something a little differently, well that was certainly the case. Years ago a German born Russian man was shot, the bullet moved just a bit to the left and missed his heart, that man went on to become a celebrated genetic scientist in the Soviet union, creating artificial life, it was a secret for a long time, but in 1998 an article was published by an underground paper that exposed these things for what they were, including a full list of names, and even some photos, it ruined many lives, but something like this couldn\u2019t be covered up, these things could be spotted by their violet eyes, while at first was thought to be a genetic issue now turns out to be an entirely different man made species of humans.\nMany of these things had family\u2019s with humans, relationships with children; friends and work, in a week it was gone, families destroyed, lives ruined.\nThey were moved to a new subsection off Moscow simply called \u2018South city\u2019 the men were reduced to work labour and many women worked as maids or other less than desirable jobs, to some humans they were fetishized, to most they were just animals.\n\nIt was said that there are no murderers in the soviet union, such things are such an American mindset, it helped those like this assassin you contacted, they swept it under the rug, in the instance Your brother was shot in the head? He spit in the face of an officer is what the report would say and youd never see of it again.\n\nChecking your watch you found your way to the neon lights of the Vishka bar, the noise of the drunkards and the smell of tobacco of the group smoking outside, turning into they alleyway you could see the old military escort vehicle sitting there, the passenger side door was left unlocked for you.\nThis was it, there was no backing out now.\n(You can choose anyone to be the target, I personally recommend this character hiring the assassin is a temp, and to have your main character either the target, or an associate of said target.\nThe start of this story after the meeting will focus a bit on the assassin (Me) up until meeting with the target, so you will need to be able to play more than one character for this role to work well.",

I'm kind of uncertain about what I want so I'm open to ideas! I would like to keep it history or low-fantasy related (think Game of Thrones as opposed to Lord of the Rings.) I'm also really tired of getting people who don't type more than a few words. You don't have to go into mind-numbing detail about stuff, but make it believable and appropriate. That being said here are the rules:\n\n1) 18+\n\n2) Be thoughtful\n\n3) Don't ghost.\n\nShoot me a PM if you're interested or have any questions.

So please mind the mess\n\nSetting rundown:\nthe quartz void is a collection of islands floating in bubbles in a plasma void. As far as anybody knows the plasma void and bubbles with island's go on forever, therefore colonisation and exploration is a popular job with sailors. These islands are able to float by a magical rock named quartz. this rock was useful for advancing society like advanced air travel and weaponry. After cycles of travel and colonization (and a few wars) a United group of islands in the void made an economy, a society, elected a leader, and named themselves Orion. Many cycles later there's a massive boom in technology, exploration, and discovery. There's a lot to discover and experience in the quartz void, and there's a lot that can go wrong.

            "selftext": "Klaxons blared and lights dimmed to hues of red as the other ship slammed into the Dauntless. It was only a matter of time before the assaulting ship would borrow through the hardened Carbonite shell that the Dauntless was equipped with. The many screens and other HUD elements on Alyxandra's helmet informed her that the ships hull was losing durability by the moment. Time was of the essence.\n\nGrabbing one of the assault rifles from the rack, she checked the magazine. Fully loaded, thankfully. Slamming it back into the weapons she loaded two more magazines onto the belt of her suit before heading out of the cockpit. Making sure she closed and locked the heavy metal door behind her. If the ship was going to be taken, she was going to ensure that who ever was dumb enough to take on a sanctioned Union vessel wasn't going to have an easy time recovering it afterwards. Of course, protocol demanded that she set the self destruct sequence, but with so many other people onboard, she couldn't risk it. They had a fighting chance and she meant to use it.\n\n\"This is Commander Cross to all units. We have an unknown ship attempting to board. Shape of the ship suggests a Reaver boarding party, but be ready for anything.\" Taking her hand away from her comm unit, she hoped that enough people were already out of hyper sleep that they would be ready to fight back as soon as the hull got breached.\n\nIt wasn't the first time her or her unit had to deal with something like this. Pirates and other lowlifes were a dime a dozen in the endless expanse of space. No, what worried her was how close this attack happened to a class 5 planet. No one should have been brazen enough to strike a ship within planet side retaliation range. This was planned.\n\nCalculated.\n\nThey were after something and didn't care what stood in their way. Perhaps, she thought to herself, there was a reason she wasn't allowed to do a check on the cargo after all.\n\n------\nI'm really bad at segwaying from the writing to a pitch about myself and the like, so let's brick the flow real quick and see what happens?\n\nBasically, I have been feeling for something space opera style action adventure lately. If anyone is familiar with Firefly at all, something in the same vein as that would really be up my alley. Something where we could mix action, romance, mystery, itreague and drama into the story effortlessly. For that, we can use the little story snipped as inspiration for the story and setting or we can try and work out something wholly different. \n\nAs far as writing style goes, I almost always write in 3rd person and past tense. For me, the flow between two perspectives flows best in that way rather than 1st person. I'm not a stickler for the reply length, as quality is more important than quantity, but I do prefer paragraph or more per replies.\n\nI usually write female characters, but have played around with male as well, so I can be flexible in that front. I can do pretty well in most pairings, so if you feel you'd want to mix it up a bit, I'm sure I can work with it as well. Although I will reemphasize that I'm looking more of a romance vibe first and foremost. \n\nFor the most part I try to be as active as possible on discord, which would be my preferred option for a roleplay platform, but I'm also not the fastest to reply at times. I still try to have at least a single post made a day, but I hope that my partner would understand that sometimes life can get in the way. But even when the RP might not be rolling forward, I'd love to have someone to chat to between posts. Shoot ideas back and forth, discuss characters plots and anything else that we'd like. \n\nAnyhow, I have rambled long enough. I think that if you bothered to read this far through to the post, feel free to message me. I'm likely not going to be noticing the comments on this, so be sure to PM me instead.",

            "selftext": "I have a somewhat specific plotline idea that I'd started to develop with a potential partner, but then life happened for her so she had to drop out. I still like the idea though so I thought I'd post it and see if anyone else \"bites.\"\n\nThe gist of it is this: I would like to play a male character who is faerie, or fey -- at least half -- but who is being held captive by the human powers-that-be for potential political gain. Perhaps he is a prisoner-of-war being traded, or he has knowledge that could be useful to the king/queen/ruling parties, or even has to complete some sort of specific task or quest that only his kind can manage. Under duress, of course.\n\nYour character, the female in this storyline, is tasked with keeping an eye on him, whether that means escorting him where he needs to go, accompanying him on the \"quest\" he has to complete, or just basically making sure he stays alive, since he's valuable. But he's also a tricky, slippery sort, with powers that need to be curtailed, and she's just the woman for the job, as she may have specific skills or knowledge that make her suited. I realize it's a bit of a Jaime/Brienne set-up, but details can be tweaked here and there to make it our own. \n\nFor instance, she could be a part of some sort of religious order that gives her skills or abilities -- or access to sacred items -- applicable for the situation. Or she could be some kind of wise-woman who knows a few things about the fey and how to keep them in line. As long as she's a strong, competent, capable character, since those are the types of women I like to play (and play off of). I just developed a fondness for the idea of this trickster-fey-guy, so I want to give him a shot.\n\nBonus points if you also love world-building, since I'd like this to be an original setting. Probably medieval-ish in time-frame, but with various magical/fantasy elements. I particularly love drawing upon fairy tales and folklore as inspiration.\n\nThere will likely be romance involved, since I'm a sucker for that, but I enjoy a slow build-up. Please be the appropriate age -- honestly, the older the better, because I think I'm at least twice the age of most folks on here!\n\nI strongly prefer GoogleDocs. We could do e-mail but I will probably collect everything in GoogleDocs anyway since it's easier than scrolling through endless e-mails. Discord is okay for OOC chatter but not viable for me as a writing medium.\n\nIf you've read this far and really love this idea, please DM me! I would deeply appreciate it if you could provide a writing sample or two (and I'm happy to do the same). Thanks for reading!",

            "selftext": "The lines broke apart, the world ripped asunder, they came like a tide. The enemy hardly noticed us, their unstoppable tide running over us. Chaos marines, mutants, and worse blooded their blades on our friends, subordinates, sisters, and battle brothers. In the last moments of consciousness, many realized why the rate of fire seemed so low. Many of our allies weren\u2019t firing. Rather they seemed to be struggling, some affliction of the mind. As the tsunami of heretics and demons mounted the barricades, a chant sounded from almost half of the imperial army at hand, \u201cHYDRA DOMINATUS.\u201d\n\nThey turned their guns towards their allies, and the line became chaos. It blurred into splattering of gore, allied, enemy, and your own. We all fought valiantly, as valiantly as one could in such a mess. Bayonets, chainswords, and flamers blunted the horde. With many of our men in uniform turning against us, a million black crosses were raised in a few minutes. Friendly fire, brother on brother. It was no surprise the world soon went black.\n\nIn an instant, yet hours later, light slowly returned. Blue, unlike the black sky you last saw. It was morning, and the blood covering you had mixed with a layer of dew. A mousy little man in munitorum issue uniform and flak armor, is above you, pillaging what he assumed to be a corpse. Seeing your eyes, he jumps back and shows his hands but keeps them not far from an auto-pistol holster. \u201cImperial! Imperial! Who are you?\u201d He shouts. \n\nWho are you?\n======================================\n\nHey there. I\u2019ve been itching for something 40k, and something character focused. The gist is, we got knocked out, the enemy marched right over our heads, and we are behind their lines. We will be the only to survivors nearby at the start, though we may run into civilians or other imperials later on of course. I\u2019d like it to mainly focus on the duo, and their bond. Preferably I\u2019d like them to be of different armies, (I. E. not guard) just to add to the dynamic, but that\u2019s not a dealbreaker. Try to have a good knowledge of the setting. Don\u2019t call bolters multilasers, etc. I prefer to run it through reddit PMs or chat. Feel free to hit me up, then we\u2019ll talk from there. I\u2019m not picky, as long as you can competently write and hold a character.",

I\u2019ll skip the background information and get to the juicy parts but I am more than willing to give you some information about me if you would like to know.\n\nEverything below are suggestions and are able to be amended and discussed so do not feel that you have to go with the exact scenario or order of events.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Short list of preferences:**\n\n\\- MxF dynamic with myself playing the male\n\n\\- Semi literate to advanced literate writing style. I easily do 500 words minimum with establishing scenes and background information in excess of 1000 words\n\n\\- Email or Google Docs for writing, Discord for story discussion and OOC chatter\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Scenario A (Modern/Supernatural):**\n\nYou are driving down a long stretch of highways between towns late at night for reasons unknown. Despite the late hour you are alert and attentive due to having recently drank coffee or taking a stimulant or any other means to stay awake. In the distance you see a large form lying across the road.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Scenario B (Medieval Fantasy):**\n\nLife has been going normally in Drayton. Working at your family\u2019s stables has been your entire life outside of required education. Even though the business your family runs for travelers is homely and well equipped, competition runs fierce as there are other horse lodging business with finer accommodations and amenities which attract the wealthier patrons to the city. During a normal day\u2019s business you see a large white and brown horse walking down the path of a breed which only can be afforded to the most wealthy of citizens.  \n\nTypically you disregard such a steed, knowing that they will inevitably be led to the fancier stables, causing you to turn away and tend to the next common brown which has approached the business. What you don\u2019t realize is that the expensive horse has turned away from the luxurious stables and towards yours, waiting patiently in line behind the other patrons. People immediately begin to move out of the way, thinking the horse and its owner are a high ranking official for inspection or some other important business, but the man leading the horse politely explains that he is no different than anyone else and would wait in line happily.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Scenario C (Modern/Slice of Life):**\n\nWorking on your Ph.D in \\[insert whichever degree field you want\\] has been overwhelming. Late night hours of studying, inordinate amounts of coffee and highly technical discussions have taken their toll. You observe the other aspiring students look the same way you do, with heavy bags under their eyes and mountains of books and papers weighing them down.  \n\nExcept one.\n\nFor some reason, a new student to your class looks unusually well rested and agreeable. More surprisingly, rather than taking down pages of notes on his iPad, he spends his time drawing pictures of the classroom, professor or other students. Eventually you allow curiosity to get the better of you, pushing you to break away from your circle of friends and introduce yourself to this intriguing student.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Other ideas/pairings**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* A soldier in a combat zone having to protect a family from invaders \t(Modern or Fantasy)  \n \n* A paranormal investigator who has uncovered a secret plot to overthrow \tthe human realm  \n \n* A personal bodyguard for a high value individual is forced to take \tthem undercover for protection  \n \n* An  Uber/Lyft/rideshare driver picks up a passenger who happens to be \troyalty running away from her family  \n \n\nI am also open to any other ideas you have in mind.

            "selftext": "Hey folks! **I'm a seasoned writer who normally enjoys long term, multiparagraph roleplays. But this time I scout for something slightly different.** I will still greatly value high quality and nifty ways of using descriptive and emotive literary devices in text. Yet right now with much shorter posts. I'd like us to create an **active and captivating story filled with various, realistic, flawed, multidimensional characters while using only 1-2 paragraphs per average post.** On the contrary to starters/exposition posts, that will probably remain pretty lengthy.\n\n**If you are an experienced writer and such short posts sound like a challenge? You might be the person I\u2019m looking for!**\n\nI know this will be a struggle for myself, because I'll probably long to create chunky bits of text. Showing everything from surroundings to my characters' thoughts. But I realize that with frequent, shorter messages we're able to swiftly move the story and explore much more than with slower, more packed posts. Plus, I'd like to practice capturing the moment or thought in a single paragraph. Something I'd normally stretch over at least few of them. I think it's a useful skill for writers and comes in handy at times, especially with novel writing. **If you're up for a challenge?** ***Let's do this!***\n\nI'm open to your own ideas and cravings but if you came here for mine, here you got an **incomplete list of things I dig** (*probably all genres that exist, which we can mix up!*). Pick something and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll have lots of ideas for any of those. Just please make sure you match the requirements at the end of the thread!\n\n* **Realistic action, settings and behaviors. Complex personalities, outside threats and inside dramas.**\n* Military/law enforcement or criminal characters. PMCs, bodyguards and men of power.\n* Small town Sheriffs, single fathers, new neighbors, old friends. Secrets? Maybe even Supernatural/Mystic?\n* Near future and advanced technology? Drones, mechs, robots. AI? Alien invasion? Interstellar expeditions and new planets?\n* Symbiotic parasites from space or ancient legends of animal guardians?\n* Tropical jungle tribes, snowy mountain monks, fishermen from forgotten dunes town. Or secret communities that survived the end of the world?\n* Escaping to cryogeny sleep and waking up to unknown future. Gritty and dark dystopian or utopian cities?\n* Cyberpunk, futuristic, virtual second life better than watching perishing planet?\n* Apocalyptic wastelands. Zombies. Mutants. Or just natural cataclysm? Pure survival and loneliness. Unexpected love.\n* Historical settings like Old West or Roman Era. Or tweaked with a dash of fantasy or sci fi?\n* South American cartels or local street gangs? Experiencing life in the streets and life behind bars.\n* End justifying means, good guys becoming bad guys and other way round.\n* High medieval or low urban fantasy? Overpowered warriors, prophecies? Or illegal non-humans living in the ghettos?\n* Warzones. Resistance. Middle East or WWII? Or just another \"witch hunt\" on humans with superpowers?\n* Everything going wrong. **Duty or love?** Reuniting years later. **Sacrifice**.\n* ***having to earn your happy endings***\n\nThat said, I might be interested in any genre and scenario as long as characters we choose to rp match my preferences and the story itself has potential!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PLEASE BE:**\n\n\\- **18+**\n\n\\- an **experienced and detailed writer** willing to keep text volume at 1-2 solid paragraphs per frequent/semi-frequent post\n\n\\- who enjoys writing (as well as writing against) realistic, **masculine** male characters\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**If you feel like we might mesh well, go ahead and send me a PM!** Tell me about yourself and your preferences. Share some samples if you like. Or just drop your current craving and we\u2019ll take it from there!",

            "selftext": "Hello from the east coast! I'm looking for a few new roleplay partners today- especially those who like anime! If you're interested, here's a bit about myself and how I write:\n\n\\- I'm a 22 year old college dropout who works at an animal shelter. I give dogs walks, baths, and other stuff like that.\n\n\\- I write in the third person, and can usually produce two to three short paragraphs.\n\n\\- I absolutely adore anime tropes!! They're easily my favorite thing to include in a roleplay.\n\n\\- I do fandoms (sometimes), like Beastars, My Hero Academia, Kakegurui, Doki Doki Literature Club, and others! Introduce me to your favorite anime/manga!! I'm sure I can adapt!\n\n\\- My favorite genres include: Slice of life (often in school settings), urban and medieval fantasy, psychological horror, western, action, and adventure! (In that particular order)\n\n\\- Romance isn't a must, but it's always fun! Having that sort of conflict and reward at the end is interesting!\n\nI think that's all I have to say! If you have any questions, feel free to ask, and I'll get back to you soon! Bye bye!",

Plenty of other adventurers are on their way there. We just have to survive long enough to see the world recover. And perhaps our characters can find more than survival with each other.\n\nThis is a fantasy war romance roleplay. I put 18+ up there just in case, because romance does tend to lead to other things, but we don't have to get nasty. The basics of this are that our characters are in the world of Hatharia. And in Hatharia, some butthole Warlock named Raegarok released his patrons demonic army upon the land. We are the normal people, the casual farmers and merchants. We are not meant for war, but we are trapped in it anyways. As the demons invade our lives and attempt to destroy them, we have to make hard choices between fighting and survival. We have to do what needs to be done, for each other, and for Hatharia.\n\nI write about 1-2 paragraphs per reply, and ask that you do about the same. It doesn't have to be painfully detailed, I just really want to see where this goes. While I did figure out the base plot, I would love to hear ideas on what happens next and what things you believe can happen within this world. I'm up for just about anything. Just throw it at me and we can make it work.\n\nDM me for more info and contact information\n\nAnd please don't ghost.",

Not necessarily Game of Thrones, but a world we can build together.\n\nI've been writing on and off for the better part of 15 years. I generally write a couple paragraphs per post, though that can go up or down depending on the situation and what is needed. Must be over 18, of course. I have some general plot threads to dangle, but would be happy to discuss, and generally see where it takes us.\n\nMy prime writing time is normal business hours in central time. I'm available otherwise, but generally that is much more spotty. I'm capable of several posts a day, but would like to be able to get a minimum of 1 or 2 out per day. I totally get that life happens, and that may not always work.\n\nAnyway, hope to hear from you and see if we can work something out. Thanks!",

The world we'll be playing in is called 'Tolveh', it is a classical high fantasy world with the many usual races (humans, dwarfs, elfs, orcs...) magic, mystical beasts and many regions, i have figured out the outlines of this world and some domains but would love to discuss more of the world building with you and hopefully collaborate into completing this  magical world.  \n\n\nFor characters, you could be anything you want, any race or backstory, full freedom over your character (except i do have a certain disdain for the princess/high-born archetype), but i would like for both our characters to form an unusual or unlikely pair, i have built 3 characters with refs for you to choose for me to play, depending on the character you'd like me to use the story line would be different:  \n\\-Thavyrn \"The Red Bull\" Liathbeard : a proud great 5 feet tall dwarf with a signature thick red beard and long red hair, bearing a stoic face and a stern expression, characterized by his dense and muscular stature, he is a stouty fellow and the tattoos riddling his arms and neck hint at his deeply rooted heritage of fighting dwarves, that if his heavy decorated war-hammer wasn't a token obvious enough.  \n\\-Gunther \"Strandveil\" : a tall and strong 6'4 half-orc, his features are mostly human just like the way he speaks and dresses, except for his green skin, his canines and the beast-like shape of his almond eyes coupled with yellow inhuman pupills, he is a man/orc of few words, of great focus and experience, his skills at the sword make him a coraecious opponent but it is his \"evoking\" relics which one must fear the most.  \n\\-Dorian \"The Baron\" : a human soldier of very plain features, 5'10, strong build, brown hair, he lived a plain life before war took him away and changed him, he discovered his love for battle on the battle-field, and thus his arrogance, his confidence and his bitterness all grew together, until he met with a manifestation of the bleak dark forces of the world in the depths of a mine, there, his human nature merged with the darker spirits and he became what he is, \"The Baron\", although he does not dress or act like his nickname.  \n\n\nPlease have a ref and a quick bio, i'm looking for a proactive partner who isn't afraid to spice things up and discuss with me aspects of the characters and story, romance and what not aren't necessary, character develoment is encouraged, i play in third person and use visuals.  \nHave a great day.",

I look for longer posts to get us started and then typically do paragraph responses as we get into the play. The way I see it, details are what matter most here. Since we can't physically see or touch one another, I need to be able to feel you through your writing - and you'll certainly feel the same from me. I hope you message me back letting me know you are interested. We need to talk about a few things in this role before we get going. I love using photographs for faceclaims, outfits, settings, etc.\n\nAs for the college football based roles, here are just a few idea?\n\nCheerleader x Player\nCheerleader x Coach\nCheerleader x Recruit\nBooster x Player\nBooster x Coach\nCoach\u2019s Wife x Player",

I love to write detailed descriptions and delve into a character\u2019s head/emotions as well as surroundings. I compare it to writing a novel together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand if the scene doesn\u2019t have alot going on and therefore requires less like rapid fire. I adore having long, thoughtful replies where we truly immerse ourselves in the world. I'm hoping to find a partner whose as enthusiastic and passionate about the plot and writing as I am. When I get invested in a story, it\u2019s 100% dedication. Getting a reply is the highlight of my day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a big fan of romance and using face claims. I\u2019m the type to make pinterest boards, spam you with gifs, headcanons, and send you songs that remind me of our characters and/or ship. I'll get excited if we come up with a great plot idea or if our characters are being cute or going to get into trouble. I live for this kind of stuff honestly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast but not least I only do MxF (with myself in the female role) and don\u2019t double, but I\u2019m more than happy to write side characters of either gender to help move the story along. I'd highly prefer female authors writing male characters. Male authors, please stop contacting me. I've been burned too many times. If you persist, I'll ignore your message.

Both in character and out of character. (Literate to advanced writers only, please. I'm not looking for newbies).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- The more description, the better! I'm looking for someone can write as much as me (2 to 4 paragraphs or more) and really bring the story to life. I lose interest if I'm the only one that's invested/enthusiastic or coming up with plot ideas. Quality writing makes my heart happy, as does world building together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- The use of real life face claims and joining me in the wonderful world of ship/character development isn't a requirement but I'd sure be delighted if we were on the same page in this regard. (I won't use anime faces, only realistic art if you're uncomfortable with real life)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Someone who won't leave without warning or explanation after sending the first post. I'm looking for the long term here, and I have been greatly saddened by how many partners have left me high and dry recently.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you've made it this far, thank you! You won't be disappointed in writing with me. I tend to be online daily and I'd like it if you were too. Please let me know if you're going to be inactive, long days/weeks of silence make me nervous.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOriginal Genres:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Mafia/Crime\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Post Apocalyptic/Dystopia\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Supernatural/Modern Fantasy\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Southern/Mid-Western/Urban Gothic\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Modern Mythology/Fairytale Retellings\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Sci-fi\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Superpowers/Gifted\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll my characters will be adults and I require my partners to do the same, as there will be adult themes in my writing. ***For more plot and more genre ideas, message me*** \\^\\^ I prefer to write over email but can use discord for chatting and writing, along with google docs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease be detailed when you message me, let me know why you chose to contact me.

A loving father called Roger lost his 18-year-old daughter to a brain tumor. He had been spending almost all his adult life on building a cloning machine. He first tried it on his wife but the machine failed and his wife died. He swore he would keep her legacy alive by perfecting the machine, he tested it on rats, monkeys and all kinds of animals but the day he lost his daughter it was too much for him. He tried to clone her dead body and made a computer chip resembling what she was like as a person. Unfourtanly the clone did not turn out the way he had hoped, the first time it woke up it attacked Rogers's assistant Henrik who was the daughter's boyfriend when she died. Roger decided too put the clone into a coma for everyone's safety, he couldn't kill it yet he wanted to try and be able to make her normal again.   \n\n\nHowever when they woke her from her coma a second time she grabbed another assistant and this assistant died instantly. Roger couldn't explain it with science it was as if she could kill someone by touch alone. It made no sense to Roger, how could something have such a power? Was it a mistake to clone a dead body?    \n\n\n\\*\\*\\*   \n\n\n  \nWho will you play? In my scenario, you will play an assistant who gets hired to help Roger around the lab. You will gain empathy for the clone and release her but in my vision, Roger doesn't know who took her and that your character stays in the lab to gather information and such.    \n\n\nWhat I'm looking for:  \n\n\n1.

Whichever kind of Conner you want, but I am looking for a romantic pairing between him and a human.  This is a super futuristic roleplay, so it's scifi and has space ships, earth and traveling to other planets while these two individuals try to figure one another out.  \n\nI have some side characters to offer for the plot, but I haven't done a lot of world building.  I'm open to any and all suggestions for world building, but I have a few things I have to keep.  I really am looking to do this for fun, but I have more story-related stuff to tell whoever messages me with interest.  I'll also say this, I am a weak  scifi writer, so I do need help to make it more scifi.  When you message me, tell me about your scifi experience, so I know you are at least a little serious, lol.  \n\n  Here are my standards:\n\n1. Multi-paragraph roleplayer.\n2. Open to being friends on discord.\n3. An adult, no children.\n4. Plot is 90% plot, 10% nfsw stuff. \n5. Active poster",

Mind you, it\u2019s the school year so things are a bit slow. We would like active players to join us in our adventures! We also need active gms, contact me if you\u2019re interested in helping tp run adventures for our players.\n\nTo put it simply, Luffy lost. He didn\u2019t find the one piece, and he didn\u2019t become king of the pirates. He died, quite tragically. Blackbeard killed him in the final battle, along with the rest of his crew who soon fell after. What followed was worse. Blackbeard became king of the pirates, and with his power, waged war on the Marines and the Revolutionary Army.The structure of the world crumbled as his regime grew. The war went on for years, long enough for Blackbeard to have children who rose up to power themselves, allowing Blackbeard to establish a monarchy.\n\nThe years went on, the government fading, and Blackbeard\u2019s regime becoming the government.The Revolutionaries were pounded into nothingness, and the marines are still fighting to this day, but on their last leg. The world is in a cursed era, where a corrupt pirate regime issues the bounties, a system more cursed than the world government\u2019s rule.\n\nWhat will you do in this dark era?\n\n\\-A unique world and storyline that can change depending on the actions of the players within the world.\n\n\\-A balanced stat system with staff dedicated to make it so that everything stays fair, with the use of stats being discouraged unless it\u2019s an ooc conflict where two people can\u2019t come to an agreement.\n\n\\-You earn what you want through proper character development and rp. No roulettes, and no giveaways!\n\n\\-The ability to create your own fighting style to develop and add abilities to over time as you grow in power. You can make it unique to yourself, or you can add it to the public fighting style codex so other players can use it as well.\n\n\\-A unique progression system specifically made to work without training logs. We hate training logs. A lot.\n\n\\- 7 different professions to choose from, each with their own different and equally useful abilities as you level them up.\n\n\\-A ship building and customization system that allows people to decide the size, and what facilities they want on their ship.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the link, hope to see you there! [https://discord.gg/nUPhahb](https://discord.gg/nUPhahb) \n\nDM me if there's an issue with the link and I'll send you one directly.",

I found a place, thank god for the internet, and i moved in. I started living a good and happy life\" *I said to a man passed out on the bar, i had a little to drink but not to much enough to make it home a pass out enjoying my day off tomorrow, which couldn't come any sooner. I stumbled home made it up to my room and zonked out on my bed. In the morning I was awoken by the sound of a doorbell, i went downstairs, okay more like almost fell but. When i answered the door i was told to sign for a package and after i did the mailman was gone. So here i am with a box that i didn't order on my front step and a hangover.*\n\n\nHello, Thanks for reading this is kinda a prompt i came up with on the fly and figured why not so my idea for this rp is that i got a female robot. Yeah might be kinda overused but I've never done it and am ready to poor my heart and soul into this rp. And we can change things, think of it more of a anime, we can go into different things and test out things, so yeah its not just NSFW. Anyway message me if you 18+ and interested, i would prefer to rp with a girl because they take it a bit slower, but feel free to respond if you Male, Trans, Non-Binary, as long as you have a discord hit me up, can't wait to rp with you :)",

The fandom characters are all aged up and over the age of eighteen. I would prefer most of them to at least be 21 for certain elements of the story.\n\nAlso my age is 27 for those interested in knowing that. I have about 10 years of RP experience at this point.\n\nSo on to the rp! I am looking to play a version of the Arnie Terminator! Specifically I think it would be fun to play the one in Dark Fate. Who after killing John loses his purpose and has to find a new one. Essentially I am looking to play a Terminator Human Love story. Where the Terminator finds a woman in a bad situation (with a newborn or pregnant) and saves her from it and a romance grows from it. I'd like to see some some interacial elements as well but am open to where the woman comes from. \n\nIf interested let me know!",

I was always a sucker for medieval fantasy and all the worlds people build for that genre, so I had decided to create my own one. And I think I am far enough to roleplay in it and expand it further. Before I start with my ideas for this world or something about the world in general, I want to talk about some roleplay basics.\n\nI roleplay for around 6 years now and am a writer for much longer. My post length is usually somewhere from 1 to 3 paragraphs, but I can easily do more. I am not the fastest person to reply, but I try my best to get one or two replies out everyday, sometimes more. But there will also be days without any replies at all.\n\nThe only thing I want from my roleplay partner is that they properly engage. No one liners, contribution to plotting and planning and just a little will to roleplay. I had enough people writing me one liners or letting me do all the work beside roleplaying itself. \n\nBut now, what do I want to roleplay and where? \nI roleplay on Discord, where we can make a server ( which is generally easier for roleplays like this) or we can stay in private messages, whatever your preference is.\n\nIrelea is a land full of magic. At least, it was full of magic. What had once been a spring of new spells and a gathering for mages all around the continents, has become a dark, cold place. 70 years ago, the capital had been burnt to ashes by a thing, a god, some assumed, that no one had ever seen before. It had started a war between the two main fractions of the world \u2013 the humans and the elves. While the humans had been sure that the elves had wanted to wipe them out, the elves had felt helpless when they got attacked by the humans too. Soon, most of them were killed and imprisoned, only some were able to flee to the Sun Queen in the south. \nThe human king, also called the \u201cking made of ice\u201d, has ever since the small victory over the elves tried to conquer the whole land. The winter-isles in the north were his already, as well as a major part of the North. Some people say while accusing the elves of magic use against the humans, he might be practicing dark magic as well. The king resides in Weyde, a city full of smugglers and assassins, but the more stairs you climb, the better the city gets. Rich people, royals, they all live here and enjoy the privileges they get. \nWhile the Sun Queen doesn\u2019t engage in war without being attacked herself, there is another second player in this. The rebels that have sworn to get the freedom for the land back and to not follow any king or queen.\n\nMore of the world can be explained privately then. So, where are our parts in the story?\n\nI have two ideas to this. \n\nA rebel human who has been brought into the palace of the king to find out more about his dark magic use. But she somehow ends up at his dinner table more often than usual and later on also in his chambers or his private gardens. She is torn between doing the right thing for the land or following whatever she feels for the king. \n\nThe king\u2019s most trusted general is sent on a mission across the land, into the rainy east. There he meets an elf in hiding after he had been badly injured by a group of vampires that slowly establish themselves in the country. After she heals him, she accompanies him to his destination and they lose each other\u2019s paths, only to see each other again when the elf is brought to Weyde for imprisonment. \n\nIf you have any other pairings/ideas fitting into this world/ scenario, please tell me!\n\nIf you are interested, message me privately!",

Like.most Indian Men even he has this habbit of having this Male ego , attitude and male Chauvinism in a way .... Initially when Anushka fell in love she looked upon Him as a smart boy , a great batsmen , a smart athelete and a Youth icon ..... Soon after marriage she started to realise that apart from what she noticed Otherwise before marriage , Few things she couldn't then which in last 2 years of marriage she has been experiencing is that how he is a male egoist , though he dosent stops her from acting in films but always is kinda uneasy and stern about she getting late back home in nights after shootings and also Sorta stops her from performing kissing scenes in her films leave the intimate scenes aside... And this wasn't just enough that lately he has even Sorta started to show his uneasyness when Anushka would wear heeels for a reason that when she's even in her normal heels of 2 or 3 inches still she would shand an inch or 2 taller than him and when in her party high 6 inches heels she would stand good 4 to 6 inches taller than him and as a typical male egoist Indian man , he wont take it and though would never tell it verbly but by some or the other way would show his uneasyness and sternenss and she would have to wear flatss even when she knows that those royal dresses of her would only look good in heels.... So in last 2 years she being a typical Indian wife hasn't been able to counter him though heated arguments happen at Times but she being a woman knows how Indian values are If a man leaves a woman that's not a problem but a divorcee woman tag is like a sin.... That's the Orthodoxy Indian Mentality is all about... So in last 2 years she has been filled with frustrations and she dosent know how to do what to do to get some relief ...\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nSexual life in bed has been ok so far how ever even sex is at his will and perhaps once theybhave sex he lasts not more than 5 odd minutes or so and yet would they to behave the similar typical Manly manner he does .... That's the story of mostly all Indian men .... If you can relate to it now ? If I make any sense ?\nSo now we need to have some Storyline to start the scenerio May be Outside Indian when may be I have a shoot outside India and he dosent have to Play any matches ....so he plans to accompany me for our so called 2nd honeymoon as this is our 2nd year of marriage ..... Something like that I mean Iam throwing rough ideas ....\n\n\n\n\nShe needs a Man/Men\u00a0 in proper situations,, unpanned, like slice of life , real life based situations.... and scenarios .....so they bring her out of that Indian shell Make her feel like a woman\u00a0 \u00a0\nat the same time is Alpha enough to handle her husband in a proper manner classy yet stern when needed,, if you get me?",

Here's a post in which to host some of my smaller prompt ideas I couldn't make a larger post about!\n\n[A4A] *Mortal Kombatants* for this I'd like to play in a world where VR technology has gone all out, really inserting you into the world of the game. One such game is Mortal Kombat. It's basically just us fighting as the characters we enjoy. (me personally, I prefer the ninjas)\n\n[M4F] *dont make a promise you can't keep* this would be an action filled day of the Halo mythos, I'd be playing John-117 aka the Master Chief as a human colonized planet comes under Covenant attack (this is A/U so the story can really be set anywhere but I prefer prey CE or post 4)\n\n[F4A] *the darkness lives on*\n\nI'd like to create a Destiny related rp that takes place outside of the main story.  Your class and powers are up to you but neither of us will be playing THE Guardian. \n\n[M4A] *smile, carl* \n\nA simple Terminator inspired story, this would be loosely based around the events of 2 but the characters and events are ours to command. I will be playing the T-800\n\n[M4F] *we... Are denim*\n\nVenom inspired rp, completely a create your own world story \n\n[A4A] *imperial point of view*\n\nAny star wars story that has us playing from the perspective of the Empire!\n\n[A4A] *horror show* \n\nAny horror related stories, whether it be OC or even Halloween based.\n\n\n\nHope one of these caught your interest! Feel free to message with any questions, ideas or concerns etc! Looking forward to hearing from you!",

He's not really a big guy nor is he super confident. \nHe's shy but very loving. He can be a hothead at times. \n\nHe is mute! Meaning he cannot speak. \n\nI would really love to do an mXm pairing with him but I'll do mxf as well. Preferably a realistic role-play with our characters being close friends in highschool. I very much enjoy drama and story as well. \n\nNSFW elements are fine by me, as long as they aren't the main focus. He won't really be super confident at first, as he is self conscious.\n\nI ONLY play on discord and I only play in third person. Please more than two little sentences per reply\n\nAny suggestions?

I'm currently looking for some long term RPs to keep my work breaks from consisting of me just scrolling down my instagram feed repeatedly.\n\nHere's some things you should know!\n\u2606 My general RP preferences are anything modern day and realistic - I am trash at writing sci fi or fantasy, etc.\n\u2606 I am semi-lit, quality over quantity. Sometimes a 5 paragraph response just isn't needed in my life!\n\u2606 I am an avid lover of anything dramatic. I love drama in my roleplay, build up, suspense, all that kinda' good stuff. \n\u2606 I also like having additional characters to keep the story feelin' alive! So please be able to play more than one human when the time calls!\n\u2606 Talk to me! I like brainstorming ideas for how our story will go! I do like to chat outside of the roleplay occasionally even if its just a quick 'hey, what do you think if we went down this route?' Or even just a good morning!\n\nAnyway, without further ado here are my current cravings and interests that I'd like to play! - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OC9tcXaoeGqU_Gtnr36TxNaYvBdgNZ08D3VnCxbij7E/edit?usp=drivesdk\n\nxo\nLylie",

I\u2019m looking for a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles roleplay and am looking for someone to play cannon against my Oc. I am willing to double, BUT, I do have some rules for your characters. Now, I\u2019m not saying you have to play a specific character, but do not have a character that is overpowered. I want characters with flaws, characters that are real, I don\u2019t want Mary or Gary Sue\u2019s that come in and whop the bad guys without breaking a sweat. That\u2019s boring. Also I\u2019d prefer not to have characters that don\u2019t make sense, like the biological child of shredder or Splinter.\n\nThat being said please feel free to get creative with your character! And if you\u2019d like to play a genderbent version of one of the turtles or a slightly altered version of April or Casey, go ahead, within reason obviously.\n\nAnyway one last thing to note is that I do not roleplay with people who use one liners or short replays. I can get it if your response is short because of the scene, but if I\u2019m writing a paragraph and your giving me single word responses, the roleplay will end really quickly.\n\nAnyway thanks to anyone who read through this all! PM me for my Discord or Kik, depending on your preference, and tell me your favorite desert item!",

Im looking for literate roleplay partners to delve into some gritty stories with. \n\n(Though, there\u2019s something I should mention out the door- I do not have a Discord. I know it\u2019s all the rage these days, but for personal reasons I cannot use the platform. I hope that\u2019s alright and won\u2019t deter too many people.)\n\nAnyways, I do have plenty of characters I can use, as well as plots and worlds. I don\u2019t mind exploring yours, though! Im all for it. Just as a fair warning, many of the themes I use in creating characters make mentions of mental illness, medical institutions, drug use, et cetera. If you\u2019re easily triggered, this probably isn\u2019t the roleplay for you, as there\u2019s plenty of mentions of rather messed up stuff.\n\nI think that\u2019s all I have to say! If this interests you, let me know! I don\u2019t mind answering questions and getting back to people as soon as possible (:",

            "selftext": "Happy long weekend, everyone! \n\nI'm seriously craving a Greek mythology roleplay these days, so here goes. I am looking to write as the Goddess of the Hunt, Artemis. You have all the freedom to write as another god, a hero, a demigod, or a mortal (anything within your realm of imagination, really). \n\nA bit of background before we get to the fun stuff - I enjoy action/adventure, slow-burn romance, and NSFW elements if the plot calls for it. I enjoy chatting with my partner offline about plot, life, and just anything really. I am a literate writer, but quality over quantity. I do expect my partner to have good grammar and writes more than one-sentence responses though. Other than Greek mythology, I'm also a big fan of MCU and Witcher (I write Canon only), so if you have any ideas for those, do shoot them my way. \n\nI am 21+ and I expect my partner to be the same. If you shoot me a message, please give me something to work with. Now for the fun part :) I have a starter on the Greek mythology idea below: \n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*The sacred stag was dead.* \n\n*The news arrived at Mount Olympus by the Messenger God, Hermes, and all who attended the counsel conveyed shock in their own manner. The stag, protected for millennia by the Goddess of the Hunt herself, had been brutally murdered in the dark of the woods, right under the Huntress\u2019 nose. Which would explain Artemis\u2019 missing presence at the council of the Olympians. The Sun God, Apollo, twin brother and close protector of the Huntress immediately demanded the culprit to be brought to Mount Olympus for judgment, but alas, Hermes bowed his head and announced that the butcher has not been found, and that Artemis had already picked up her bow and headed to the site of the murder for answers.* \n\n*And beneath the disarray of the Olympians, and under close watch of the moon, the silver-eyed huntress stepped through the familiar woods with tempers high and bow drawn, searching for the offender that dared to test the wrath of the old gods.*",

After a few years of living in the same place under the roof of his annoying and religious family, my character finally finds a way out and moves to the big city for a job opportunity, and he loved it there, he loved being free, being in a place where he knew no one and no one knew him, things were a bit unexpected in the city, and in this joyful chaos where he lived, an unexpected encounter happened, he met his old friend, the one he had no news of, only thing is..his old time buddy has transitioned into the confident beautiful woman they have always been.  \nNow it is up to discussion wether they recognize each other right away or there is some sort of connection that builds up before they realize it, i just want this story to be a human love story about self love, acceptance, and eventually moving on from your past with a gripping slow burn love story in the middle of it all.  \ni play in both first and third person, pretty literate, talkative ooc.",

I\u2019ve been roleplaying for five-ish years and my old plots have died out due to ghosts and slow replies, which I usually don\u2019t mind, but one paragraph responses after a two week disappearance doesn\u2019t cut it sometimes. \n\nI\u2019ve got a particular itch for a romance/medieval plot. My character is the princess of the world we\u2019d create together, and she\u2019s become of age to wed - and is in an arranged marriage with your character. They initially hate each other and try to convince their parents to reconsider the arrangement but our characters eventually bond over time. That\u2019s the very basic version.  \n\nOther genres I\u2019m interested in is generally anything except from high fantasy and sci-fi. However, I\u2019m up for hearing all ideas no matter what! So if you think you can sway my mind, please do. \n\nPlease be over the age of 18 if you\u2019re considering sending over a message! Oh, and NSFW is okay with me - but not the aim of the plot. I\u2019m also okay with fade-to-black scenes though. I use discord only! \n\nThanks!",

I have about 10 years of RP experience at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**COMICS!**\n\n**Let\u2019s Start With DC First!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBatman/ Cat Woman:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBatman/ Talia Al Ghu:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHal Jordan/ Carol Fenis:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRichard Grayson/ Kori Anders:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRichard Grayson/ Barbara Gordon:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTerry Mcginnis/ Ten:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGarfield/ Raven:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDonna Troy/ Roy Harper:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBatman/ GenderBent SuperWoman\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGreen Arrow/ Black Canary:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThose are the main one\u2019s I am looking to do, however they are not the ONLY ones I am looking to do. If you have a DC pairing you want to do not on this list go ahead and ask me! I might be willing to do it or it could be a situation where we double up or something!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**MARVEL**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPeter Parker/ Mary Jane Watson:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPeter Parker/ Felicia Hardy:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPeter Parker/ Sue Storm:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Hulk/ Black Widow:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSteve Rogers/ Peggy:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nScott Summers/ Emma Frost:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLogan Howlett/ Ororo Monroe:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSame as Dc! Just cause they aren\u2019t listed on here doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m against playing them. If you have a canon on canon pairing you\u2019d like to float my way please do!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TV SHOWS**\n\nArrowverse:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019m open to most pairings portrayed in the show, from Barry and Iris to Cisco and Gypsy. I do prefer Oliver Queen and Dinah together but could be convinced to do something with Felicity.\n\nOne thing that interests me right now is the future arrow kids. Something I wouldn\u2019t mind playing around with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWatchmen:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of the few I would want to do Original stuff for!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGame Of Thrones:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking primarily for the following pairings: Jon/ Dany and Sansa/Tyrion\n\nThe Witcher\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019m looking to play Geralt Of Rivia to a Yenneffer of Veneberg\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nANIME\n\nMaken-Ki:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFine with either canon pairings or something original\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChivalry Of A Failed Knight\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking to play Ikki to someones Stella\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDarling In The Franxx\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking to play original characters on this one\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDragon Ball Z\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking for the following pairings: Eighteen/ Krillin, Vegeta/ Bulma, and Gohan/Videl\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**VIDEO GAMES**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAssassins Creed:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis one would be original characters and assassin stories\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInfamous:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019d love to play Cole Mccgrath against an OC!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFire Emblem: Three Houses\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPretty open to any pairing in this one!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMass Effect\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am looking to do retelling/rps of the original trilogy and Andromeda. This would be against my canon Sheph and am looking for canon versions of the female love interests\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHarvest Moon\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI love Harvest Moon! So I thought I would try and see if I can find someone to play an OC sort of Harvest Moon with me! In it my guy (or your girl) would be coming to the town to do the usual Harvest Moon storyline! They would then fall into a romance with my (orr your) character. If interested let me know!\n\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n\n**Movies**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStar Wars:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019m open to any era and pairing for this one! As well as original stuff.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrozen\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would love to find someone who could and would be willing to play Queen Elsa for me! I have Oc\u2019s in mind and or Jack Frost from Guardians!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAtlantis\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019m looking for someone to play the Kida to my Milo!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTreasure Planet\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking for someone interested in being the Amelia to my Delbert!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTransformers\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019d like to do something involving the Transformer universe! While I\u2019m not TOTALLY against the idea of their being some alien machine on machine romance I know that\u2019s not for everyone. So my thinking is MAYBE we do a human human love story on top of some sweet transformers action. I have a soft idea for it that I\u2019d love to float to the right person!",

            "selftext": "Hello, all! I'm looking to find some new writing buddies! \n\nA bit to get out of the way beforehand; I'm a semi-lit writer, and depending on how much I like the story, I can write quite a lot! I almost always mirror how much my partner writes. I write in third person only, and I ask that you please do the same if you want to write with me. Also; for the safety of myself and my partner, I ask that you and your character are of age. (I'm 18NB myself, and prefer my partners to be around 18-23. This isn't 100% strict, though)\n\nThese ideas are all vague as hell, but if any grab your attention, I would love to explain them in greater detail to you! Message me if you're interested. I'm flexible for roles in the majority of these, but I have preferences, which I will list. If my role is non negotiable, I'll make it clear!\n\n1: Every good witch has a good familiar. Without a familiar, they are significantly weaker. To prevent witches gaining too much power, they keep a close eye on witches to prevent them from ever meeting their familiars. The prince of a large kingdom does not know he's a witch, much less that he has a familiar. Until, of course, he stumbles upon someone in the castle dungeon who he immediately feels connected to. When a witch bonds with his familiar, they take on their familiar's eye colour in one of their own eyes, and vice versa.\nA.) They get along well right off the bat, and the prince plots to free his familiar as quickly as possible before his family realizes he knows he is a witch.\nB.) They bicker at first, fiercely, but the prince is saddened to see the state his would be familiar is in, the way he is treated poorly etc. The prince tries to coax his familiar to letting him tend to his injuries, and they have a bonding moment.\nC.) Suggestion?\n[My Preferred Role: The Familiar]\n\n---\n\n2: Elementals are chosen by family. Sacrificed one by one to take over for their predecessors. A lakeside town's current water and ice elemental of the lake is.. unstable, in comparison to the last. For good reason, as a [your character's species/occupation/whatever] investigating will come to find out. It's a dark, cold night when Y/C's curiosity is piqued; the locals in the tavern are going on about all the floods and storms, just generally speaking ill of the lake's elemental in a hushed sort of way. Curiosity getting the better of him, Y/C goes to confront the elemental and see what the hell is up.\n[Non Negotiable - My Role: Elemental]\n\n---\n\n3: (Warning: Character with an odd deformity: eyes on the palms of his hands.) The Oracle is not what anyone would expect. In the past, the oracles have been all knowing, wise.. The current oracle, in contrast, is.. a bit of an idiot, to say the least. And with being considered useless, no longer needed since his prophecies are of odd things rather than significant events, no one tends to seek him out. Known as mischevious and a troublemaker, everyone avouds him.\nA.) By accident, a stoic mercenary passing through the area happens upon said oracle getting himself into trouble, and comes to his rescue. Deciding it's for the best to keep the oracle out of trouble, the mercenary drags him along on his travels and develops a soft spot for him without knowing what exactly he is.\nB.) A stoic mercenary is passing through a small town when he comes across a group of drunkards heckling someone who seems to be blind. Irritated with such action, the mercenary comes to the blind man's rescue. The man is a bit irritating, but the mercenary finds it endearing and, in turn, agrees to letting him tag along on his travels.\nC.) Suggestion?\n[My Preferred Role: The Orcacle, since he's a pre-established character of mine]\n\n---\n\n4: A small kingdom is well known for the royal family being, bluntly, royally badass (pun indended, yes). The youngest prince is no exception, known far and wide for his skills in hand to hand combat as well as swordplay, and skill in varying other weapons. Like his siblings, he is often the centre of attention in news across neighboring kingdoms for feats like slaying dangerous beasts and rescuing people. One day, though, he slips up. Gets hurt and nearly killed trying to slay a beast, and a rogue mercinary is the one to kill the monster. The mercinary can either\nA.) Put the prince in his place, so to speak. He's frustrated with royals always being in the spotlight, so he takes great pride in having the youngest prince at his mercy and using him to obtain power.\nB.) Helps the prince recover, showing him what it's like to live away from royalty.\nC.) Suggestion?\n[My Preferred Role: The Prince]\n\n---\n\nI write on Discord, as it's the best platform I've found for roleplay. PM me for my tag :-)\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to send them my way! I don't bite!\n\nI hope to RP with you soon!",

            "selftext": "Going through a massive overhaul on my posts here since Reddit's spam bots thing I am a spammer.  \n\n\nGreetings to you all. I am 33, East Coast United States, with a regular weekly job. And I am on the hunt for roleplay. 3rd person player, preferring other 3rd person players. I tried first person and it got weird, sorry.  \n\n\nDiscord is a must. I am sorry but it's what I am comfortable with. Post sizes can vary, but the more detail the better. I am OK with how someone writes as long as I get it.  \n\n\nNSFW or adult situations can happen. No fade to black. I can go from it being organic to focused, depending on if the idea calls for it or not.  \n\n\nI can play male, female, non-binary. Seeking female characters opposite of mine, mainly due to loving the fairer sex.  \n\n\nRight now, I am on a modern, modern/fantasy, or slice of life kick with the whole sex, love, marriage, baby carriage type stuff. We can spice it up by going for various tones. I can also do historical plays too, and some fandoms (better to ask or check my prior RP posts to see what I am open to).  \n\n\nAnd visuals! I love visuals for characters too! Usually cheat with using actors, some models, etc.  \n\n\nI also have 3 small conditions:  \n\n\n\\-As daily as I am on, I get AFKs too. I will give notice, and I ask the same in turn. And be sure to check Discord because notifications do break.  \n\n\n\\-Be open minded, willing to talk or RP, and not set off by small things.  \n\n\n\\-If we part ways, I will respect you more if you say so and let you go respectfully. Ghosting sucks.  \n\n\nThat's the end of it all. If you're cool with giving me a shot, message me with your Discord info (name AND number) and add in your favorite fruit or candy in response. I look forward to meeting any and all takers! :)",

I\u2019d like to have a more historical aspect to it, we can go as far back as the Ancient Egyptians, or we can stick to the 1900s, whichever you prefer.  \n\nWe would start off with you being controlling and cruel to me, since I\u2019m your slave after all to start. You would treat me poorly, and I\u2019d be forced to accept it or else I\u2019d be punished in some way. But as we play out, you start falling for me. I\u2019d also fall in love, and then it would be the romance of a lesbian queen in power. Maybe we can add the attitudes of the kingdom towards this relationship, they could either accept it or we can add drama and perhaps the queen gets overthrown. I don\u2019t know, there\u2019s so many ways this can play out! \n\nI hope someone is interested. If you are, please message me on kik (in my bio), with a reference pic, an idea of the kinda story you wanna play out, and any questions etc or things you wanna add.",

            "selftext": "Greetings!\n\nI am new to Reddit but not to roleplaying and hoping to see if I might find some interest here.  I have had a great time of late taking part in some fandoms.  In the past I had shied away from it as I never thought I could do an established character justice.  Since I have grown far more confident in my writing and I have started a series of interlinking fansdoms in a continuity where both Marvel and DC heroes and villains exist, which I have dubbed Earth 542.  For folks wanting to take a look at how the stories have progressed so far they can be found at the following links, and also serve as pretty good examples of my writing.   [https://www.deviantart.com/blackstoneca/gallery/65772240/the-amazon-and-the-soldier](https://www.deviantart.com/blackstoneca/gallery/65772240/the-amazon-and-the-soldier) \n\nHere are a few of the ideas which have been bouncing around in my mind.  I am flexible as well if folks have their own twist on the pairings, I am all ears.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) For the first one with more of a connection to Hidden Agendas would involve Jennifer Walters and Conner Kent, She Hulk and Superboy.  Both of them chasing down separate leads find out they are working on the same case.  It takes them to unexpected places, and situations in which they don't have their powers in a fight for their lives while at the same time trying identify who is behind this new shadow organization who is far too efficient and well informed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) Black Cat and Red Robin - Some of my more successful and best work today have been with some mash ups pairing Marvel with DC characters, or one of the continuities with an original character.  I would like to do so, and also have a bit of \"The Heist\" story line from Spiderman: The City Which Never Sleeps.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTim Drake has moved out of Gotham and is now a member of the new Titans based in Manhattan.  In learning the ropes of his new City he runs across the Black Cat and stops her robbery attempt.  This starts the game of cat and mouse between the two till stakes become high.  Felicia's father dies in an attempt to pull of a heist against one of the Maggia crime families.  He was forced to do so as they not only threatened his exposure he was alive, but also with Felica's life.  This starts off her retribution against the Maggia, and a new gang war grips the city.   Tim is determined to contain the violence, and also get at the heart of what caused the Maggia struggle in the first place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3) The Raft battle has New York in a state of chaos as more than a few dangerous criminals escaped, but there is a mystery behind what had happened.  As SHIELD's Avengers and the United Nations Justice League track down and apprehend the criminals who pose a national, if not global, threat, a greater mystery needs to be solved, at least in Dick Grayson's mind.  How was the Raft security penetrated?  Sources point to irregularities in blood samples taken from guards, and inmates who provided cover and kept both the Avenger's and Justice League in check during the battle.  However these same blood irregularities have turned up in hardened drug addicts on the street.  What is the link, and is there something deeper, darker, conspiracy in the works, and how did the drug ICE tie in?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLife has been utter shit for Rachel Leighton.  It all started two months ago when her people of BAD Girls were hired to look into a new designer drug sweeping into neighborhoods.  Next thing, her partners were attacking police, which is something Rachel knew they would never do.  Cleo Nefertiti (Asp) and Tanya Sealy (Black Mamba) were victimized and brutalized by men which had enslaved them to a life of crime in the past.  They would not want to do anything to land them back in the Raft, and they certainly would not work with any of the Serpent Society.  The fact they did sent up red flags, and Rachel knew someone was putting pressure to get her to back of the investigation into the ICE trade.  Things were rotten to the core.  Her friends were innocent, she knew it, and she would go through anyone to prove it, even if it means accepting help from an unlikely ally in the form of one of those Gotham City nut jobs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4) There is still much about her history Shayera Hol does not understand.  Once she believes she was Thanagarian and an advanced scout sent to the planet which had done such things as repel invasions from such races as the Chirari, the Dominators, and the Kree, as well as defeating Darkseid, Galactus, and Thanos.  Now there have been hints things might not be all it seems.  It is a piece of her past she feels compelled to find out, is she Thanagarian, or is she human?  Her journey will bring her in contact with Marc Spector, an expert in ancient cultures and a man with secrets himself, a kindred spirit as their search uncovers a threat they must stop before it threatens everything they know and love.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5) Zantana and Captain Britain.  For this plot hook I am willing for the pairing to be with either Brian Bradock for male Captain Britain, or Kelsey Leigh for female Captain Britain.  The plot hooks is Zantana is on a world tour and while in London when magic fails her.  The ley lines which tie Britain to Otherworld and the mystical make-up of earth are starting to break down.  Zantana and Captain Britain both move to investigate before a large part of magic is torn asunder with disastrous consequences for the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6) If none of the above grab your interest, I am willing to hear it as long as it is a Marvel/DC pairing.  I am willing to write M role, or another F role for a F/F.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThose are the pairings in a nutshell.  I am also open to other pairings, but I am looking for a Marvel and DC pair up.  While I normally only write the Male role, I can attempt to write the F role for FxF though I have been told my F characters come of as nymphos, but I am willing to try to grow as a writer.  I also do not care who the gender is behind the screen,  If you can write, I am game.  I do not judge at all.  This is supposed to be fun.  Also if you want a list of my On/Offs for writing, or want more samples of it, I will be happy to provide.  If you are on Elliquiy,  I am Blackstone on the site.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBlackstone",

            "selftext": "Hi everyone, nice to meet you if you are reading this post.   \nMy idea is kind of simple, I have been living in Japan for a little while and reading a bit about this beautiful countries history and this inspired me to plan a roleplay set in feudal Japan.  I really love world building and we can tailor the roleplay to whatever your interests are. \n\nThe world I am creating has light elements of fantasty and isn't totally true to life, I would like to act as both a game master and a companion and depending on what you are interested in we can set out on an exciting adventure. \n\n  \nWant a dangerous romp through the war torn south, where bodies line the fields and huge armies battle for superiority? Where the sun and humidity makes you sweat within minutes, where travel is hard because of the stinking swamps and mass graves left by countless battles.   \n\n\nOr journey to the untamed north, where legends or riches are countless but no maps lead the way.  A wild and cold place where few except the strong can survive.   \n\n\nTrying to sell this isn't my strong suit really but I would like to be a game master and companion to you as we explore this world and go on whatever quests you like,  if you wanna help with ideas please feel free to contact me. One thing I should say is I am only really interested in females to roleplay with, personal preference. The roleplay doesn't have to be not safe for work but it can be, please get in touch and I can add you on discord if you are interested or I can happily answer any questions you have.",

She shot up in a state of shock, her heart skipping a beat as she realised what was going on. They were under attack. The brunette frantically rushed out of bed, desperately searching for her shift to place on her naked figure. The cold ground against her bare feet made her shiver as she reached the carved wooden cot- withdrawing her five month old son.* \n\n*Mary ran from the hut, as the wife of a Jarl she lived in his house that had been built on a small hill from which they could overlook the whole village. The woman\u2019s emerald eyes widened in shock at the sight of the huts burning, the fire spreading across the land. She could not spot her husband anywhere but she knew he was there, fighting along with his warriors. The village below was engulfed in flames- the deafening sound of woman screaming forced Mary to choke on her own breath. How could this be?* \n\n*Mary\u2019s gaze was forced upon her son, cooing playfully in his fur blanket. She knew her duty as his mother was to keep him safe, she knew she needed to hide. Mary rushed to where the women were instructed to hide if they were suddenly invaded- an old storage house on the outskirts of the village. The woman handed her son to one of the elders before helping to barricade the wooden- door. First bolting it, then placing wooden crates to make the door harder to open. When they were finished they huddled together, praying to the Gods for their survival. And so they waited, scared, terrified to the bone as the sounds of a fight continued to rage outside of the wooden door.*\n\n*When the dreadful sound of fighting died down- the woman and elders sighed a breath of relief, all the while hoping that their tribe had won. Suddenly, the sound of something kicking against the door made her and all the other women of the tribe freeze - their hearts stilling in anticipation if it was one of their own or the enemy that had won. With one more powerful kick, the heavy door swung open, making her clutch her child closer to her chest, shielding it in case of danger as her emerald eyes went to whomever had just broken the door down.*\n\nHello, I\u2019m Maddie! I am looking for a partner that can play as the man, whilst I\u2019ll play the woman he will capture. I\u2019m looking for a literate partner who is 18+, and who can write 1-2, or more paragraphs in third person. I understand that at some point in the Roleplay, the length of responses he slightly shorter due to dialogue. \n\nIf you are interested, message me and we can exchange contact information.",

I have been RPing for 18 years now (Since the time of the Yahoo Instant Messenger RPs!...before they got rid of the user rooms).\u00a0\n\nI have been searching for someone who can Roleplay as Vegeta from Dragonball Z. But heres the catch. I use an Original Character...but fear not! I don't make Mary Sue characters and I have been working on a full bio for my OC that I use just for the Dragonball franchise. It would be post Frieza Saga and go off in an Alternate Universe (no Trunks and the androids will probably come but it'll end up different) and it WILL be a romance! With action and adventure. Fights will be slightly included but if it gets too long we can time skip and try to figure out who is the winner between the characters.. Any more questions about this don't be afraid to ask me!\n\nNow, Rules... I am pretty lienient when it comes to Roleplays. Some literacy is a MUST. Of course we all make grammar mistakes (I know I make quite a bit as I look at myself typing this out lol). I do Semi paragraph to multi paragraph replies and starting posts as well full of detail. I would hope and wish that someone out there would be willing to do the same. also, this is in 3rd person. This will be romance like I have stated..but if you need to do a time skip through the lovey dovey bits please dont hesitate to tell me and we can time skip. Also...please DO NOT GOD MOD. its annoying.. Also...PLEASE BE ACTIVE. I know real life gets in the way and I'm understanding of that (trust me I work 40 hours a week I understand lol) I LOVE fast repliers they make me really happy trust me. If you get uninterested please just let me know I wont be mad I promise. also..PLOTTING. I love to plot out an idea that you might have or I might have before installing it into the RP. also about my OC I can tell you alot more about her if you are interested and I can even supply artwork of her as well.\n\nWell that seems to be the lot of it! I think I remembered everything...I hope I remembered everything lol. But please if you are interested hit me up with a PM or comment here and please don't be shy to ask me questions! I am always happy to answer any questions regarding everything I'm looking for. I hope I hear from someone!! Thanks!",

            "selftext": "First of all, a bit about me. I am an experienced, mature RPer who has a number of years of experience in different formats, including face-to-face, email, forums and the like. Primarily, I am interested in character interaction and development, especially through storytelling, conversation and relationship building. I like to see well developed, well thought out and believable characters. I prefer exotic or unusual settings, primarily science fiction, cyberpunk or post-apocalyptic. \u201cReal world/slice of life\u201d scenarios aren\u2019t that interesting to me; if it's something like a military or espionage setting, maybe, but not something 'mundane'. With that being said, I\u2019m open to ideas if they\u2019re original or creative or a little unusual.\n\nI generally like well-written, well thought out posts, and definitely prefer quality over quantity. I don\u2019t want to read a novel with each post, but I don\u2019t want to see one-line-wonders. Similarly, I am a stickler for grammar and spelling and punctuation, although I am prone to the odd bout of ferocious typos myself. However, as long as the intent is there, then I\u2019m happy.\n\nMy interests lie in mutual storytelling and creativity, rather than playing along to somebody else\u2019s story or the like. I control my character, I decide what\u2019s going on with them, I create their background and so on. I ask for my partners to respect that, as I will do the same for them. Likewise, I will never launch a major story element or a plot twist or the like without okaying it with a partner, as I would expect them to do the same for me. If I do something a partner doesn't want, then I'll gladly change it, but I ask that they will do the same for me.\n\nWhat I am looking for at the moment is a Roleplay set in the **Battletech** (or **Mechwarrior** if you prefer) universe. I am fairly open to ideas and settings, although I also have a few of my own. While this is a Tabletop RPG based universe, I'm looking for free-form writing rather than a system-based game.\n\nIf you are interested, please contact me by **PM**. I will not reply to messages posted here",

            "selftext": "Hey all, I'm hoping to play out something new today, I will be playing a female character, while being a male. I do love this OC and I just want to do something really wholesome with her. Also, no  NSFW stuff, if the story ends up with them doing intercourse, it will be fade to black. Falling in love is cool but nothing inappropriate.\n\nAlthough it may never come to that. There's only one constant with this, my OC. A black haired, pale skinned, tall, powerful witch. Naturally purple eyes and the best at what she does. A tall, powerful beauty who lives in isolation. Some say she's far more powerful than the legends go. She's lived for as long as records and legends have existed. But she's *alone*. She had a castle almost, in which she overlooked the kingdoms. (Or maybe they weren't kingdoms. Maybe she lives on a starship if want a Sci fi/magic amalgamation). And one day something happens, something life changing.\n\nBut what is it? Maybe she wanders the streets and finds a poor child begging for adoption and she takes her in? Maybe she meets/saves someone who won't let her go? Or whatever we choose to decide, that involves her meeting someone that changes her life. But I'd love it to be wholesome and pure. Something to really lift up both of our spirits and make 2020 a really happy year. A roleplay full of happy events and cheerfulness.\n\nThis time I'd like to focus more on something nice by way of a grown person meeting her. Perhaps someone who isn't as scared of her as the rest of the village is decides to prove them wrong? Or maybe she's just curious and wants to see what all the fuss is about? Something romantic would be really nice. \n\nI do warn you, I'm.. *cough cough* neuroatypical. So if I'm a bit weird at first, it isn't your fault. It's Asperger's. I use discord and I don't mind the length. Typically I do 1-2 paragraphs, however if you use more. I will make an effort to match that. I'll put the effort in that you do. I hope to talk to some wonderful people from this prompt.\n\nHappy 2020 to everyone. :)",
