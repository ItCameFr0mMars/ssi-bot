            "selftext": "Hey everyone! This is a callout post for a new group RP I'm creating- though it could be started solo if it takes a while to garner interest- set in an original sci-fi setting.  \n\n\nMy goal here is to create a free and open sandbox for the players, but with guidance and rules in place to keep things from becoming entirely aimless. There will be 5 star systems with varying amounts of planets and space stations to explore within them, with the possibility of discovering more! I'll be GM'ing to provide that at the start, but will eventually look for others to do so with me depending on the size of the server. The tone and feel is along the lines of an Elite Dangerous or Star Citizen; wanna be a space trucker? Go for it. A gun for hire, venture capitalist, pirate, politician, explorer, scientist- anything! I'll find a way to make room for it all.  \n\n\nThe server is currently under construction, but I'm taking members now to work on characters and answer lore questions and such ahead of getting things started! Feel free to PM me if interested or if you have questions, since this whole post is a bit vague.",

Timeline wise I'd like this to be set post Inqusition, but some of this js negotiable. \n\nI'm willing to RP with you regardless of gender, but keep in mind if you're interested in romance I only do FxF.\n\nThis rp will heavily feature mature themes, with at least some lewd elements. As such I'm only willing to rp with people 18+. \n\nI'm open to RP on Kik or Discord, dm me to exchange info and we can figure out the specifics from there!",

            "selftext": "Pveth is medieval fantasy role-play set in a fictional world. It is a role-play that features dark and gritty elements. It is not a role-play of good versus evil, rather a role-play sitting in shades of grey. The personal ambitions of the character that make up its roster, the agenda of lords, and the everyday challenge of surviving. Politics and intrigue are a very large part of the role-play. The actions of a role-players character are not limited (as long as they are within the realm of possibility), and the big rule in the server is every action = reaction.\n\nThe goal of Pveth is to create an authentic and immersive role-play experience. To create a role-play that is not only centered around the characters that are of the royalty but also of the nobility that wishes to claw their way to the top, the peasantry looking to survive and maybe make a name for themselves or even a lone knight trying to prove his honor.\n\nAs stated above, this is not a role-play of good and evil. This is a role-play where it is composed of all sorts of characters. Your royalty may not be the good kings of fairy tales -- but more like tyrants. Your characters will not be able to always easily fulfill their ambitions -- their may be other characters that wish to stop them or even have conflicting interests.\n\nThe main focus of the role-play is the original characters that you make and how they interact with and shape the world around them. Alongside this are carefully crafted events that will occur over the course of the role-play -- but they have no set end and how they turn out is always dependent on the actions of the players.\n\nThis is not your standard kingdom role-play. Can you survive Pveth?\n\nJoin here: [https://discord.gg/BB3J5Rn](https://discord.gg/BB3J5Rn)",

I\u2019m open to any ideas you might have and even have some of my own. As to what we can role play as I\u2019m really open minded to trying things. I prefer slice of life romantic roles that may turn sexual after a good amount of buildup. I also prefer writing in 1st person. We can start on reddit PMs to get a feel and see if we\u2019re a good match. We can then move on to another platform from there if you want or we can just stay on reddit. I don\u2019t really have any limits on the roles and I\u2019m fairly open minded but I will tell you if I\u2019m not really into doing something. I honestly don\u2019t care about age at all so older women feel free to message me as well. \n\nSince we\u2019re roleplaying I can play as anyone but I prefer playing as myself and if you want a description of me feel free to ask me for a more in-depth description. But I\u2019m white, dark brown hair, green eyes, pretty tall. \n\nHope to hear from some of you :)",

            "selftext": "For many years now, the people of Reaverville have lived in the shadow of Lord Reaver von Malgath, who rules over the town from Castle Morgrave. Lord Malgath rules from their old residence with an iron fist and a cold heart. His elite, nameless Shadow Council control the city below- under their watchful eye, the villagers live in relative comfort, but their happiness is no more than a mask. Still, people stay, as the outskirts of town hold the Cragglethorn Forest and Leviathan Lake, both home to dangerous creatures that lurk in the night. Within the city, the Church of the Blazing Sun does their best to lift the spirits of citizens and protect them from evil with the help of the Holy Flame, while knights and guards patrol the cobblestone walls to fight back the monsters that threaten life within the city.\n\nWith the town on the brink of war, neighboring countries have sent in knights of their own in order to aid Reaverville, resulting in even more tension than usual. For now, things are calm. But, like most things in Reaverville, the peace that still stands is only an illusion, and soon, the true darkness that lurks in the shadows will be revealed.\n\nReaverville is a 18+, Gothic inspired, LGBTQ+ friendly rp with a helpful staff and an immersive story. Play as a Vampire, Witch, Warlock or Human villager, and work as a nun, deacon, or a slayer in the Blazing Sun church, a knight within Reaverdale or from another kingdom, a member of the Silver Star Coven, or as one of the dozens of professions available within the kingdom. With the ability to play up to three characters, there are plenty of interesting options for character creation that will allow you to explore a variety of main and subplots within the city. We hope to see you soon, and remember- all hail the Dark Lord.",

            "selftext": "There he lay peacefully, as if he were asleep. Canelo, his friend of many years, had his head rested against the ground, blood congealing in beautiful crimson clumps against the soft cotton of his t shirt. Were the situation not so tragic, Attila could have appreciated the remains as a piece of art; a handsome statue carved from marble, pale skin absorbing and amplifying the somber rays of moonlight. What *happened*?\n\nLooking back, he could hardly remember *anything* that had happened. His train of thought was off the rails as soon as he had regained consciousness, after all. The sensation of his brain throbbing against his skull was overwhelming. Sitting up, he carefully rubbed the back of his cranium. Coarse, sticky. There was a deep wound under the crown of braids on his head; any deeper and he\u2019d likely be at rest like his dear friend.\n\nThe worst part? For the life of him, he couldn\u2019t remember how things had ended up this way. Uldin had disappeared only a week before. Being the older brother, it was his duty to head the tribe of Huns after their fathers death. Following Uldin\u2019s trail with Canelo, his older brother, Duke, and two of the other tribesman had led them here. When they had reached the crest of a dune, everything had gone black. Now one man lay dead and the other three were nowhere to be found. \n\nThe sands of the desert stretched on endlessly. A cool breeze blew gentle over the landscape, making his hairs stand at attention like a soldier during roll call. Any attempt he made to move his legs ended in utter failure. One thing was for sure. There was no time to mourn. If he didn\u2019t get out of this desert soon, he would surely die. \n\n\u2014\u2014-\n\nI typed this up pretty quick, so excuse me if it isn\u2019t the cleanest prompt. I want this to be more of a post apocalyptic roleplay. People have reverted more to tribalism. There are still big towns here and there, but technology is essentially obsolete. There\u2019s no such thing as luxury anymore. Attila is the son of a tribe leader; they go by the Huns (yes like Attila the Hun). His father recently died and his brother mysteriously disappears while trying to complete the ceremony to become head of the tribe. I\u2019d like a female counterpart.

I highly recommend that movie. But, anyways. I\u2019m thinking of either a high school setting or an after high school setting. \n\nI\u2019m looking for a slow-burn romance with mature themes. I want there to be a balance of light and dark. I want there to be fluffy scenes, and I want there to be serious scenes. \n\nWhat I\u2019m not looking for is smut. I have no interest in writing this. If it gets to that point, I\u2019d much prefer if we fade to black.\n\nDm me if I\u2019ve caught your interest!",

            "selftext": "Hey\n\nI\u2019m interested in roleplaying. Over the years roleplaying has changed. In recent years most men roleplay by typing a couple of short sentences and expecting me to just want sex with them, but this is insanely unrealistic and it\u2019s not what I\u2019m interested in. \n\nWhat I\u2019m looking for is a partner who enjoys creating characters and playing through stories. I also like men who play \u2018normal\u2019 men. A lot of men online like to play \u2018alpha\u2019 males, the reality is these alpha males aren\u2019t very well liked in real life and thankfully not many men are actually like that, but for some reason on the internet most guys want to be these overbearing bossy men. \n\nSo I\u2019m looking for a partner who will play a more realistic character, someone who has all the vices and insecurities of normal people. \n\nI enjoy playing a character who is in high school and I prefer men to play any age upto mid 60\u2019s. The older the better really. \n\nI have a few ideas that I can expand on if you are interested.....\n\n1. I\u2019m a trafficked 18yr old from Eastern Europe who ends up in america being forced to work as a whore from a trailer where I\u2019m looked after by a middle aged woman. Before being tricked into coming here I presumed prostitution was all about dressing up and finding well off men at night, but the reality is poor guys from the trailer park scraping barely enough money together to see me because they don\u2019t have the confidence to date real women. \n\n2. Trailer park neighbour. I\u2019m a high school student who sneaks out in the evening without mom knowing and meets boys from school in their cars, my shy quiet neighbour is always looking out his window as I come and go. He has a wife and a child with learning difficulties so his life is hard. \n\n3. Im a student still in school and you\u2019re  my favourite teacher, you\u2019re a bad teacher because you try to be nice to the students so you usually lose control of your classes, but it\u2019s nice to have a teacher who doesn\u2019t talk down to us. \n\n4. You\u2019re a nerd who still lives at home with your parents and has a part time job in a store or something. Your life is playing computer games and comic books and D and D, so you\u2019ve had little success with women. I bring my younger brother to your trailer one day because his Xbox has broken and he says some of his friends have used you to fix their consoles as you\u2019re cheap, so I bring my younger brother and his Xbox and I don\u2019t find your geeky hobbies weird like older women do because lots of boys in school are like you. \n\nI have lots more ideas so feel free to chat to me. \n\nIn all the roles I WON\u2019T like you because of your physical appearance, I WON\u2019T like you because you are well off. The only reason we like men is their personalities. So if you can\u2019t talk and be friendly (or make an effort to talk if you are shy) then my character won\u2019t be interested. \n\nFinally, it\u2019s important that you understand your character will have thoughts, feelings, emotions, because without them you won\u2019t be very interesting. \n\nMy Discord name is.... well I can\u2019t type it here because of Reddit\u2019s rules. So ask me and I\u2019ll message you with it. \n\nThanks for reading. \n\nxx",

I have ideas for both routes and possibilities! I have tons and tons of ideas revolving around pregnancy, and if you have any I\u2019d love to hear those as well! \n\nYou can be either male or female but I will be playing female no matter what you so choose to play, and I will preferably be playing the character carrying the child. \n\nI am 18+ so I require my partners to also be 18+. With all of this being said I hope to hear back from some of you and I hope you have a wonderful day!",

Basically it\u2019s just like having two GMs for one roleplay I guess! We would control major characters, enemies, and minor characters....it\u2019s like two people writing a book I guess!\n\nAnyway, as for plot I would much prefer fantasy or sci fi for this! If this is going to be large scale perhaps a war would be fun? I do love me some world building and politics!\n\nMessage if interested!",

In this prompt the story has been altered slightly in certain points during the 1st to 3rd games resulting in a new story for us to explore!\n\nWe can start from any point in the universe, beginning at the first tournament where our heroes meet for the first time, or where our favorite blue and yellow ninjas team up to defeat a greater foe, forming an alliance we will see later in the timeline.\n\nI also have pairings for the universe including non-romance and romantic. Rain and Kitana, an OC and cassie etc. Even some of the more obscure. Any story is up for grabs. A good idea is all you need. \n\nOf course we don't have to use one of my arcs, we can create a new one for us both to enjoy. The main story I had in mind was a slow burn romance between cassandra cage and an OC of mine, both on the team of the next generation MK characters living up to the legacy their parents left behind and hoping to surpass it.\n\nMy character is Tundra, son of sub zero. A fierce warrior but caring friend who can see the potential good in even the worst like ermac who previously has been nothing more but a villian\n\nHope you enjoy the premise and I'd love to create a fantastic story with you! Message me with any further questions you may have! Thanks!!!",

            "selftext": "(I recently saw the new Code Geass movie.... and... I\u2019m looking to build a story based in the universe of Code Geass, but with a completely different country and royalty.)\n\n*The Kingdom of Myrfall has long been divided into a cast system.   The \u201cUntouchables\u201d being displaced to live in the northern snowy tundra lands over hundreds of years ago. The King, Andrew Myrfall, began plans to disassemble the cast system working together with his Queen to create equality. On the day of Princess Amandla\u2019s tenth birthday, a rebel attack on the castle took the life of her father.... The same day the King planned to give his address to the Kingdom of Myrfall about dissolving the Cast system.*\n\n*From a young age, Princess Amandla always had to be weary of her thoughts when around her mother. The Queen\u2019s cold and emotionless face was unpleasant, but it was her impeccable timing that was truly terrifying. The Queen was well known for always being one stop ahead of her enemies, which included her one and only daughter. Amandla figures out for the most part that anytime she involved someone in her plan, her mother would squash it. It always seemed like anytime she told someone a secret... her mother would find out. Every friend she tried to make in the palace was driven to insanity with crazies whispers in their heads.*\n\n*As Princess Amandla grew older and more  aware, she soon found out about the hushed rumors that circled around about her mother. \u201cThe Queen planned this. A devil Queen. They say she made a deal with the devil to read minds and control people.\u201d Of course, the were only rumors. Yet, she couldn\u2019t deny the truth that was rooted to those rumors. It almost made too much sense...*\n\n\nHello!!!! \nTo sum up my brainstorm above, I\u2019m looking for a role play based around Geass. You certainly don\u2019t need to have seen Code Geass to role play, but it would be helpful. The Queen in the story is trying to bring back the Cast system and force the rebel\u2019s back into slavery and sending them once more to die in the northern tundra. \n\nI\u2019m looking for a male partner that would be willing to play two main love interests for Princess Amandla within the story:\n- 1 male rebel spy. I would like this character to have a geass power of their own. The character can be a normal rebel or be the leader of the new rebels. I am thinking this character would be undercover working in the castle, which his mission is to assassinate the Princess Amandla.... but finds out somehow, that she isn\u2019t like the Queen. This character will be forming a friendship, romance but most of all, an ally with Princess Amandla.\n- 1 male Prince from a neighboring/foreign country. (You can decide the details and character) I want this character to be influenced by the Queen\u2019s Geass, Whisper. The character will still act independently, but be very much acting as the Queen\u2019s puppet. This character can have a Geass, if you want, but mainly the Queen\u2019s goal is to marry off Princess Amandla  to this foreign Prince so that she is out of the picture. The Prince\u2019s actions can be either good or he may be working with the Queen, that part is up to however you build this character! :)\n\nNow about the Queen\u2019s Geass, Whisper: ability to manipulate, read, and sometimes fully control the minds of people within reach. The strength and depth of this ability depends on the time spent with the victim, with the strongest whispers able to fully possess all corners of an opponent's brain, reading their thoughts or controlling their actions without their opponent even knowing. The Geass works up to 25 ft away and is impossible to turn off. The Geass can focus in on one person\u2019s mind, but it requires the user\u2019s full energy. The more time spent controlling the victim, the easier it is the next time for the user to control that victim. The Queen is unable to read the mind or control Princess Amandla.\n\n\nAlright, this has got long winded and very scatter brained.... but this was a basic brainstorm of the idea. I\u2019m looking for a fun romance, political and adventure type of story! I want drama and all that jazz. I love the idea of corruption and geass helps add to that. There will be more characters in the story, but the Queen, Princess Amandla, Rebel Spy, and the foreign Prince are the characters. Feel free to message me with your ideas or if you are interested! I am a literate writer and tend to prefer third person writing. I\u2019d love to talk more on reddit before jumping over to discord. I am really looking for a good fit and someone passionate about this idea!",

But quality over quantity! 18+ please and only message me if you're into creating a story together that has drama, tension and a lot of build up. I'm not looking for just smut or ERP! Thank you! \n\nAnd with that out the way...\n\nLylie's Roleplay Cravings...\n\nCLIENT/ESCORT\nShe is a high class escort, paid for by an obnoxious businessman in need of a date for his company party. Cue a run in with a business rival, which also happens to be his escort's ex boyfriend some drama ensues, forcing an unlikely bond to form between the two. This is very open to adaptation, I'm hoping to play the escort role. I'd like them both to get off to a rocky start, with thanks to his huge ego and her hard to hide attitude.\n\nBOSS/PA\nA CEO finds himself being chased by his new PA, for his money as opposed to his good looks. She is a ego-maniac, convinced she'll have it all, however she meets her match when her new bosses wit and intelligence isn't what shes used to with her other sugar daddies. Again, i'm hoping to play the female PA in this one. She can be, or is, a complete bitch, i'd like him to outsmart her at most turns, a lot of back and forth scheming and such. Also open to adaptation.\n\nCULT FOLLOWER/AGENT\nI might or might not have any idea of where I'm going with this but I was wanting to do some sort of government agent/cult follower scene. A guy gets sent to kidnap the daughter/follower of a religious cult. She's forced to live with the agent in solitude somewhere whilst he attempts to get information from her. Like I said I don't even know what the hell i'm doing with this one, its just something in my head that i'd like to try.\u00a0\n\nCHEATING HUSBAND @ A HOLIDAY CAMP.\nI'm a young girl working at a summer vacation camp. Lots of forest, log cabins, bicycle rides, you know the ones. You're the typical guy who goes to that kinda place, a bored husband &amp; father. I want some twists to happen in this one. I want the guy to be dark, not desperate for a fuck and that's it. I need the juicy drama. Hit me with your character ideas?\n\nLITTLE RICH GIRL.\nI'm a spoilt rich kid with an escalating drug habit, you are my new dealer or somebody else in my life affected by said habit.\u00a0\n\nCan also open this to different scenarios - kidnapping the daughter of a high profile politician for ransom? Taken at the mall to be trafficked? Or maybe something else you have in mind? I also like the idea of a stalking scenario.\n\nREMEMBER ME FROM HIGH SCHOOL?\nYou bump into an old high school 'acquaintance', if you could call me that - you hated me in school. I was your typical popular blonde bitch, except now I'm off the rails. A love of drinking and a drug problem to boot - you bump into me at a local bar where i'm looking worse for wear.\n\nOther things I quite like the thought of:\u00a0\n\n\u2014 these sort of angsty themes.\u00a0\nprison, mental illness, mental health facilities, addiction and alcoholism, actual psychopaths.\n\n\u2014 relationship things.\ntoxic &amp; messy relationships, friends with benefits. love-hates and power struggles, messy love triangles.",

My reply times vary,I usually try to respond once a day,but I work in healthcare so that can change on a dime.I usually let my partners know if I am going to be away for a bit. OOC chat is amazing,but it is not a requirement. It is nice to plot,talk,and just make a friend though I do understand if that is not your cup of tea.\n\nHope to hear from you!\\~",

            "selftext": "Hello all! I've decided to go on a hunt for some roleplay partners. First, a bit about myself. \n\nI am a 20 year old girl who loves to create characters of all kinds and act out roleplays that are funny, romantic, and worth the time invested. While I do have my moments of business or tiredness, I am pretty free most the time. I roleplay in 3rd Person and my personal favorite genres are slice of life and/or modern fantasy mixed with romance. I'm not too picky on length but my comfort zone is 5-15+ lines depending on my level of creativity and how much the other person puts out. I do prefer LGBT roleplays although I can do straight roleplays. I prefer our characters to be able to change out on the who wears the pants role or for me to be the lesser pants wearer. Most of my characters are less masculine  or ambiguous. EST Time Zone.\nNow onto preferences for my partner. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMUSTS: \n\nBe 18+. Not for any reason other than my own age and not wanting to RP with people below the age of 18. \n\nMust be willing and able to have or create a decently fleshed out character. I have a character template that I use for my ocs if you need one. Character tropes are fine, although I take some issue with some but as long as they go beyond that trope and are their own person beyond 1 or 2 character traits, they're fine!\n\nMust have decent grammar and spelling. Now I know nobody's grammar or spelling is perfect, but I need to be able to understand what you're typing. Also be able to write at least 5 lines a reply. \n\nMust reply... semi regularly. I understand being busy and having times where you can't reply for a few days but id like to be notified if and when those things happen. I usually wait 2 weekz for someone to reply and will send the occasional 'hi' or 'hey' as a reminder. (Note: I also encourage you to be annoying to get me to reply. Sometimes I get distracted to the point of forgetting to reply or Discord won't send my reply or won't notify me when you reply. Send me reminders. If I ghost you it's never on purpose.) \n\nMUST NOT GHOST. I get being busy or even not wanting to roleplay with me. LET ME KNOW. So many people tend to ghost  when They get busy or dont want to tell me that they're not feeling me or the roleplay. Tell me. That way I know and can have a little closure. \n\nHave Discord.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEXTRA POINTS IF (you do not have to share these but it helps if you do)\n\nYou roleplay LGBT (Admittedly I enjoy RPing MxM most- so even more points in that case!)\n\nYou like multiple RPs, multiple characters to be going on at once \n\nYou like talking and developing the RP as its happening\n\nYou are okay with rping as/with ocs who are mentally ill or physically disabled in some way. \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nI do have a few character ideas, but no specific plots!\n\nSend me a message telling me about you, what you like/don't like in a roleplay, and if you hit any of the extra points! Make sure it's a message and not a chat/comment as I typically don't answer those as often.  If you messaged me and I didn't answer I was probably busy! Feel free to Send me another message! I look forward to role-playing with you!! Please send the keyphrase \"Don't ask Don't Pas-tell\" somewhere in your message so I know you read through everything. I probably won't respond otherwise.",

            "selftext": "Before we go any further I\u2019d like to explain the asterisk: male characters are a case by case basis; before we exchange discords I\u2019ll want to know what you\u2019re bringing to the table because I\u2019m very bored with the same three male characters being recycled at me. I have a preference for non-binary characters followed by female characters. I write for romance if that wasn\u2019t clear !\n\nSecondly, I need patience. It\u2019s great that people can promise 5+ replies a day but I work full time and have other things I both need and want to do. So if you \u201c\u201drequire\u201d\u201d multiple daily posts, I\u2019m not the one.\n\nIn general I don\u2019t do slice of life. I find it very dull and I will lose interest quickly which wastes your time and my own. I need something horror, fantasy, eldritch, etc to keep me interested.\n\nLast few things; I only write on discord and I need face claims. Commissions of art of your character that were drawn for you are fine. I need my partner to be 21+. I am not looking for fade to black themes right now; if something comes up I\u2019d prefer to write it out but NOT be the focus !\n\nHere\u2019s stuff I\u2019m looking to write. I will indicate at the end of each one which role I\u2019m wanting to play.\n\n1. TIME WARP: character A isn\u2019t anyone special in her world; honestly she\u2019s just getting by. while being treated for insomnia, she starts having very vivid dreams. The world seems like it\u2019s from a book\u2014 walled cities, dragons, knights. Strangely enough, her dreams seem to continue, picking up where she left off each time she goes back to sleep. She gets bold knowing this world is hers and she can\u2019t suffer any real consequences. That is until character A gets hurt and can\u2019t wake herself up. When she comes to, healing, she finds herself in character B\u2019s care. Character B has been watching her disappear and reappear ; do they want her \u201cmagic\u201d? Will they blackmail her somehow? In character B\u2019s mind, A owes them a great debt. || I will play character A. I think it would be pretty funny if B was a nobody but lied and made them self to be more important to A. Love a relationship built on a lie !\n\n2. SHEEP'S CLOTHING: character A lives in a small village in the Margeride Mountains of south-central France in the mid 1700's. Wolf attacks are common, but usually they don't attack adults. A group of men -- well, that's left -- return in the middle of a misty night. Battered, shaken, they speak of a 'beast'; sounds like a wolf but too impossibly large, with features a wolf cannot have. Day and night men from neighboring villages fill the woods to try and hunt the beast. On their way home from gathering berries, character A runs into the beast, character B. It's as horrific as they say it is, and Character A seems to be able to wound it. Of course, nobody believes them; hoards of men have tried, there's no way one person has succeeded. So, character A sets out to try and apprehend the beast to fetch the king's ransom. Little do they know, character B, a long time friend and their neighbor, has a terrible secret. || basically a twist-ish on the beast of gevudan story ! I will play character B and will be using my own werewolf lore, cause I love writing werewolf lore.\n\nIn general I have a lot of ideas involving monsters and the like, so feel free to pick my brain about it. also open to Witcher themed RPs if you are. If interested DM ONLY. Chats and comments will be ignored. I\u2019ll need a writing sample from you and I will send one of my own as well.",

The RP takes place after the Trespasser DLC and will involve a plot with all three protagonists from the games prior. This is a literate server so detailed, in-depth writing is highly encouraged. We also allow OCs along with auditions for canon characters so it allows a whole new cast. You also have an opportunity to join factions or make a completely new one. \n\nDue to the heavier themes the game has, we allow only 18+. There aren't any active rps as of right now so it feels a bit dead, but I'm hoping to revive it by advertising it on here. So if you're itching for some good'ol Dragon Age or just fantasy themes while waiting for the upcoming game, this is server is for you!  \n\n\nHere is the link: [https://discord.gg/HjkQ45R](https://discord.gg/HjkQ45R)",

            "selftext": "Estoria was a small kingdom, it was beautiful, placed between the river and the southern sea. Despite being small it was rich. It had a big port with busy markets and it's lands green with plenty of crop. The issue was that despite its enormous wealth, the kingdom wasn't particularly armored. Compared to nearby kingdoms its army basically didn't exist and could barely defend against a bear let alone an army.\n\nIt was well known how weak their military was and the local barbarian tribes along with the road bandits took advantage. Raids on the smaller towns that surrounded the walls of the capital were exceedingly common and threats by larger kingdoms were also increasing. They knew that when threatened the Estorians would hand over as much of their vast wealth as possible in order to keep their kingdom safe.\n\nIt had existed this way for hundred of years, but it had increased in later years and the royal family now decided it was time to put a stop to it. What they needed was an alliance. Not an alliance written in ink but an alliance bound in blood. The only issue is despite their best efforts the King and Queen had only produced one heir and they were pretty sure the unmarried rulers of the strong nearby kingdoms were not looking for a prince. Or were they?\n\nThe King had sent out envoys to both neighboring kingdoms as well as to some of the tribes in the area to secretly inquire if there was any interest in any form of alliance. Some had been laughed at, at least one envoy had gone missing into the process.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnly one had returned with an offer. But what?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHey there! I hope you enjoyed my prompt! I'll be playing the king that is in troubles, and you will be playing the man with the offer. You're probably the head of a Kingdom or tribe with a huge army at your command.\n\nThis could be both NSFW or the opposite.\n\nI like the to play long term with at least one paragraphs at a time.\n\nI hope to get some responses!  \nTell me who you want to be?",

I've had couple of roleplays in this setting that turned out really well, and I've had the incredible urge to try and replicate that success. So, simply put, I just need **18+ people**, male or female, who would be potentially interested in building up this world with me!\n\nHere are some of my caveats:  \n\\-**18+** Like I stated above. This is mainly story based, but yes, occasional adult themes can pop up, so better to be safe than sorry  \n\\-**Third-person only.** I don't hate first person, but this simply makes things smoother. This is usually not a big deal, but I know some people only like to write in first.  \n**-Competent writing.** This is probably the biggest point on here. Everyone has different levels of roleplaying, and I'm searching for the more nuanced way. At the same time, I'm flexible. As long as you can put together a coherent response, I'm most likely game.\n\nIf you want to try it or simply find out some more information, PM me, and I can give you my Discord ID.

You don't need to know the in's and out's of the umpteen Walking Dead game paths that can be taken, but a basic knowledge of the plot would go a long way in ensuring we both have fun doing this Roleplay. If you're interested or have any questions, please feel free to comment or message me! Toodles!\\~",

            "selftext": "Hi there. I'm looking for a Western-inspired RP. I prefer to write through Google Docs, or will do Discord if I must. Email is also an option. \n\nI consider myself advanced, and am only looking for other advanced writers. I tend to write anywhere from five to fifteen paragraphs, and I enjoy playing multiple side characters and developing many little side stories. I am more than happy to carry a story, but I need something to reply to. I also much prefer to play with other women, but will accept men as well. I don't mind smut but will always FTB with male partners. I would like a writing sample, and I can provide one as well! I also must say I only accept people over 21. I am 28 and feel more comfortable with people closer to me in age. \n\nPlease message me if you're interested! I have a couple ideas and I'd love to hear yours as well! \ud83d\ude0a",

This world isn't worth it, I've.... We've already Lost too mu-!?\"\n\n\nIt was then, that the unmistakable sound, of a *Lightsaber* Igniting could be heard, and the message ended...\n\n\nAnd so, because of the Immense dangers on this world, as well as the potential Jedi Threat, Lord Vader and the 501st Legion have been deployed to Donovia, to find out what happened to the 201st Legion, eliminate any Donovian as well as jedi threat, and finally claim the world for the Galatic Empire...\n\n\n\n//////////\n\nHello there! I hope you liked my little summary, now, if after reading all that your still interested, then allow me to tell you what im looking for in a partner!\n\n-Atleast somewhat experience in rp, especially action focused rp\n\n-Must have a love for star wars, and basic knowledge of the lore, especially the emperial era, oh! and this rp is gonna be mostly pro empire, so uh, hope your alright with that\n\n-In terms of how much you write per post, one to two paragraphs is good enough, though obviously the lenghts of posts depends on the context, Id also like a partner who is decently active\n\n-As for who your character can be, You could be the newest stormtrooper commander of the 501st (essentially filling captain Rex's Role as Anakin's second in command, only now its Vader)\nOr a new stormtrooper who has special talent and caught vader's eye\nOr, you could maybe be an Inquisitor, and work alongside Vader,\nHell, you could even be a bounty hunter if you like, weather its a canon one like boba, or your own OC, \nand of course if you have your own idea, id ve happy to discuss it with you\n\noh yeah, if you haven't already figured it out, ill be using Vader as my main character, though ill also do some other characters as well, such as some stormtroopers, officers, enemies, etc\n\n\nwell, if your still interested after reading aaaaall that, please go ahead and PM me, and we can discuss this futher",

Hopefully you take some time to read this and later we can potentially become friends!_\n\n_Anyhow, I'm looking to make friends with some literate to advanced literate females or futanari. I've been leaning towards having more female / futa partners since playing with men and or femboys has gotten a bit boring for me. My apologies to any men or femboys, I don't mean that in a rude way at all. However if you're a male, or trans or any other identification you prefer that plays a futa or female, that's fine by me as well._\n\n[Type of futanari I love!](http://imgur.com/a/McwOgt2)\n\n[My characters, make sure yo choose which you like the most!](http://imgur.com/a/6wNAUgi)\n\n_I prefer a long term and story driven roleplay, those are my favorite, however, I do not mind one shots and short term ones either. Favorite genres I go for is fantasy, adventure, and action in either a modern but preferably mediveal setting. Other neutral genres I'll gladly do is Romance, Drama, and slice of life. I also love supernatural &amp; darker thriller plot, including violence, blood, Gore and so forth between those lines; will not include anything too triggering for anyone but if you're into some darker things, let me know! I don't do futuristic, steam punk  or historical, maybe mythology but that's a big maybe. Anything else I'll try once!_\n\n_I'm a pretty in tuned with my kink interests, some very taboo and unusual so my apologies if you dislike any of my kinks. We obviously don't have to involve them if you dislike anything!_ [Kinks &amp; Limits](https://www.reddit.com/user/Pequena_mama/comments/dl853k/kinks_limits/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)\n\nThats about all I have for now, if you're interested please feel free to shoot me a message on kik @ yuri.babe or discord @ Sanriobunnie #8637 (Preferred) and make sure to state you're coming from reddit!!

            "selftext": "*The city still burnt as it descended below the horizon, the smell of smoke, of defeat, of death thick in the air. They had to leave it all behind, the palace filled with such wonders that one could spend a lifetime and only see a fraction of its treasures; now a smoldering ruin being picked clean by invaders, scavengers and the birds.*\n\n*Gone was the safety of the city walls, the comforts of home, it was all naught but ashes and dust. What lay before them neither of them knew, the palace had been their entire existence but now they had to fend for themselves in strange land, a place read of in cracked tomes but never visited.*\n\n*His master had lain down his life so that they may escape, now he was alone, a student without a teacher, a ship without a rudder. She knew not if her family yet lived, if they were held hostage or strung up to be food for the birds. They had to flee, their lives depended upon it.*\n\nThe idea for this roleplay has been rattling about in my head for a while and I thought I'd finally put it down and see if any of you lovely folks on here wanted to explore this idea with me. I'm in my twenties so 18+ writers only please.\n\nI've taken inspiration from a range of sources including the films of Akira Kurosawa (Hidden Fortress in particular), The Witcher, the Berserk manga and the more fantastical Studio Ghibli films. I'm looking to have the setting be fantastical but grounded (Low Fantasyesque), not necessarily grim and gritty but more inspired by folklore and myths.\n\nOur characters would be a member of the royal family and her protector but there's lots room for discussion of the specifics of each character. The princess need not be a damsel in distress nor her guard be stoic and moody. I'd like this to be a long term roleplay so starting out our characters young (say early twenties) allows them lots of room to grow and develop. I find it far more interesting to play inexperienced characters and show their journey to becoming strong, independent characters rather than jumping right to when they're all cool and stoic and can defeat entire armies with one sword stroke. I do have quite the flair for the dramatic and being overly prosaic (and perhaps a penchant for being a tad long winded but just call it enthusiasm) and love those emotionally charged moments of Anime and Manga.\n\nAs for the world the characters inhabit I'm looking to do something a bit different from the norm. Rather than planning things out, I have a tendency to over plan the lore, we just focus on the here and now and perhaps what's on the horizon. So more small scale details rather than the details of the wider world. We can discuss the broad strokes of the world, maybe come up with a dastardly villain who's pursuing us or where our characters are trying to get to, but beyond that let's not worry about all the nitty gritty details.\n\nI think I've gone on long enough so I'll bid you adieu for now. I hope to hear from some of you wonderful darlings soon and I hope you have a nice day.",

My idea is that: your character comes to Tokyo, Japan with some friends for five weeks to get away from work, and enjoy themselves. Having no idea there are dark forces looking to take your character as a conduit, as an instrument of destruction. They only waited centuries for the right person with the correct spiritual level to act on their plan. Which is why a kitsune (my character) will be the guardian to protect your character. Of course, this can end in two ways: join the dark forces and bring about the end of reality, or ensure the hope for a better future.\n\nIf you're interested, PM me. We can roleplay this on Reddit or in Discord. I would use Kik, however, Kik has a tendency to keep my messages on S with a good chance of never going to D.",

Fandom wise venom (comics preferably as I\u2019m dying for a good family based plot of the 2018 comics), the seven deadly sins (anime or manga: caught up on both), blue exorcist (same as last; all caught up), hellboy (I\u2019ve read a couple comics, seen all 3 movies) and transformers (I\u2019ve seen armada (my favourite), the bayverse movies, prime, a bit of rid, cyberverse, animated and I few others I think?) Plot can be discussed in messages and I do have a few ideas but you\u2019re welcome to bring your own. I\u2019m also open to a plot based in/around the dragon prince series!\n\n\nI\u2019m desperate for a good seven deadly sins or venom roleplay especially and maybe a hellboy one! I\u2019d love to do a roleplay set pre holy war and just take it into an au where all sorts can happen. I\u2019d love to explore the 2018 comic verse as well with venom, exploring his relationship with Dylan and the symbiote! The red one would be a cannon x oc of red and my oc and we can do anything from a demon king au to the actual canon!\n\nI\u2019m also open to any plots involving dragons or demons! No dodgy furry stuff though please. That\u2019s not my thing. Any music based plots could be fun! That one would be easier to explain In dms but to sum it up we\u2019d be making our own musical from our favourite songs\n\nPLEASE DO NOT COME TO ME WANTING A FANOM OC X OC ROLEPLAY. IM LOOKING FOR A CANNON ROLEPLAYER FOR MOST FANDOMS\n\nI am advanced/mock literate meaning I write anywhere from 5+ lines to 5+ paragraphs. I\u2019ll write my own amount to start then mimic my partner. Don\u2019t worry if you can\u2019t write past semi lit; as long as the roleplay is good it\u2019s quality over quantity and you don\u2019t use text talk. Full sentences are also always a good star!\n\nMessage me if you\u2019re interested! I have discord, amino and Reddit (obviously)",

I am +18 and I write in novella style (upwards of 300-500 words per reply) over Discord, email, or Google Docs. Currently, I'm pursuing a degree in creative writing. I'm passionate about collaborative storytelling in RP and in my career. \n\n**I am looking for a Han Solo to play opposite my Leia Organa.**  I'm interested in exploring Leia's trauma both as someone who has experienced torture and as someone who has been subjected to forms of sexual violence. It would be interesting to see how this influences the way she operates in a relationship. \n\nWe can focus on Leia and Han's journey to Bespin in ESB and/or the fallout from the events in Jabba's Palace on Tatooine. I'd love to hear any ideas you have for this prompt! \n\nMy ideal partner would be... \n\n* an experienced writer, at least 18 years old and able to deal with sensitive subject matter \n* dedicated to multi-paragraph responses with a high level of prose \n* driven by character development  \n* fairly active, able to average about one response a day\n* generally friendly and interested in plotting with me ooc\n\nI'm flexible as to where I RP, so I'm happy to adapt to your platform of choice. My writing samples are available upon request. Please PM me if you are interested!",

            "selftext": "The two of us are employees at decent sized law firm (or other major business if that matters) in the city. Both of us were relatively new, not being particularly attached to anyone and only really having shared passing greetings with one another.\u00a0\n\n\nCurrently, we were sitting in the offices horribly boring Monday morning staff meeting. Nothing was being achieved, productivity was stagnating and morale was plummeting. But we had to be here, so we all shut our mouths, doped up on the caffeine and hoped for the sake of all of us, that it would be over soon.\n\n\nOur boss, Arnold, was currently up at the head of the conference table nattering away about up coming cases and assigning them out. Most notably around us, Carol and Shawn were playing footsie under the desk, Andrus was writing \"shoot me now\" over and over again on his note pad, Elie was painting her nails, Rick was dosing off and all the others were somewhere between halfway alive and all the way gone.\n\n\nFrom this point is when everything changed. We heard a large pop, like a massive rubber band had just broken over our heads and then nothing...\n\n\nNothing at all. As in the world had frozen around us. From Arnold's mind numbing soliloquy, to April adjusting a skirt that was four sizes too small. It was all frozen in time. Save for you and I of course, we seemed miraculously unaffected.\n\n\n---\n\n\nHello all, my name is Aleksandr. I want to say right off the jump that English is not my first language so I hope you can forgive the occasional mistake.\n\nNext, I hope you enjoyed my prompt. It's an idea I e had for a while, but never really gotten to play out. It's set up that it can really play out a number of ways depending on you. If you're really only Interested in smuttier aspects, then so be it, the world is our oyster. If you want a mix of smut and story, then that works too as I have a few ideas to advance plot as we get going. If you're interested, just shoot me a message and I'll be sure to get back to you.\u00a0\n\n\nI hope to hear from some of you soon\n\nAleksandr",

I have been having issues finding partners that know the lore or can play through the lore.  I have 2 ideas. one for each fandom.\n\nIn Silent Hill, I am specifically looking to play Angela from Silent Hill 2 against James, or possibly someone who went to her school and is able to deal with all the crazy she comes with. I would like them to get involved in the cult of Silent Hill by accident or by your character's actions.\n\nWhen it comes to Resident Evil, I am looking for something that takes place after RE7 or side events after RE1 with my Semi-Canon bioweapon character and an OC of yours.  I like to do a lot of GMing, but it would be nice if someone else is able to aid the story along with me.   Now that I am done explaining, I have a few standards I am looking for in a partner.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Must be over the age of 18+**\n* **Multi-Para, but quality of quantity.** \n* **Longterm**\n* **Must be communicative, like I like being friends with people I roleplay with**\n* **Looking for an active poster.  A few times a week or more replies, one reply a week won't do.**\n* **Plot is 90% story, 10% NSFW**\n* **Due to the story types, it does involve mature themes and if you are easily bothered by violence, cults, or otherwise let me know.**\n* **Only 3rd person POV, please.**\n\nI think that's everything, I hope to hear from someone soon!

I really enjoyed the concept of the RP, so I'm looking for someone to pick it up with me, with a couple changes!\n\nThe role play will focus mostly on the older teens (Nancy, Steve, Robin, and Jonathan), but they've grown to be young adults. Other characters can appear and may be important to the story too, but the young adults are our main characters. The four of them are living in a house together, but they're each struggling with their own personal demons and struggling to make rent.\n\nI will play Nancy and one of the boys, while you will play Robin and whichever of the boys you prefer. The endgame ships are Robin/Nancy and Steve/Jonathan, but that's negotiable.\n\nAs I don't want to control your characters, you can decide exactly what they're struggling with that's preventing them from making rent, but I can give you ideas of what me and my original partner were doing if you'd like. Nancy will be suffering from an eating disorder and PTSD from the events of the show.\n\nMessage me for more details. We can use Reddit PMs or Discord, let me know which you prefer!",

I would like to have it be in an alternate reality, where women are allowed to serve freely as men in the Military. I am looking for primarily stories revolving around the US Military, but also am open to an entirely different nation being the powerhouse in these wars as well!\n\nI am open to both scenes that take place in the war, and after. I love exploring broken characters, so either are wonderful with me! I have several character ideas, and I am not at all opposed to playing different branches besides the grunts, so please approach me with any ideas you have! I would like actual combat to not be very prominent in the story, think Jarhead the movie for examples.\\~\n\n(I only play female characters, but am okay with male or female writers.\\~)\n\nI would like there to be romance with my characters, though that is up to you how you want that to play out.\\~ I should specify that I am only looking for romance in F/F pairings. &lt;3 And, truthfully would prefer you to play a female character more then a male, unless you have a really gripping character idea\\~!\n\nI'm very friendly and approachable, but I dislike writers who can't atleast give me two para's a reply.

            "selftext": "Hey All\n\nFor those wondering, its pronounced (Kor-Rah-Cah-Lah-Cle), and yea, i dunno... i come up with some random names.\n\nFirstly id like to get this warning out the way, this world is the culmination of many years of brainstorming, movie watching, deviantart browsing and youtube binging, and i feel like im ready to put it out here... hopefully to get some responses.\n\nFirstly this will be a massive post, im literally gonna be posting that entire world in this one post, so brace for a lot of reading.\n\nThis story takes inspiration from RWBY, Animorphs, Fast And Furious (particularly tokyo drift, and not for the reason your thinking), Sword Art Online, Skyrim Elder Scrolls, Japanese &amp; Chinese History, that K/DA Music video, Hunger Games (again not for the reason your probably thinking), attack on titan (no not that reason) and Avatar the last airbender.\n\n***BEGIN WORLD OPENING***\n\nMy world is set in the year 2029, in a completely different timeline to our own universe, in this universe, instead of Britain colonizing most of todays countries, and giving forth to the majority of western culture, its the opposite, the most prominent culture now is eastern culture, the generalised genre for the whole word, is dystopian future, with Neon-punk themes, Japanese culture and technology mixed in with magic.\n\nThe rp takes place in Koracalacli, a bustling city on the edge of the capital of central Australia, all countries developed with major advanceds in technology thanks to the eastern culture fronting the advanced of technolgoy, so most captial cities were in the centre of the landmass.\n\nAustralias captial city was appropriately named Uluru, and was divided into 6 sections, each with a verying demographic of lifestyles, ages, gender and wealth, the center section, being section one, was the wealthiest and consisted mostly of high rise buildings and highly dense cityscapes, the further out you went, the more the life style changed from buisness to industrial to agriculture.\n\nThis world as peaceful as it seemed is no without conflict, in this timeline eastern culture fronted the advances in colonizing because of their knowledge of the Shadoub\u012bsuto (\u30b7\u30e3\u30c9\u30a6\u30d3\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8) or Shadow Beast, these creatures are believed to be of a hive mind, seeking out to destroy what humanity has created and return the earth to its natural state, observations and studies have indicated that pollution draws the Shadow Beasts in, due to their black and oozy like appearance, they have been given the common name of Tarrs, they appear in forms of natural earth creatures to mythical beasts.\n\nHumanity, naturally always pushing to advanced themselves, made no action to reduce pollution, they simply built walls around their cities and defended themselves as need be, which created an area of no mans land outside the city walls, called the Shadow Zone, but another side affect of this was the unrest among the population of those cities the political, religious, ethical and cultural differences begun to divide the people, furthering the dividing of the cities to not just physical, but symbolic aswell.\n\nHumanity is not the same either as the humanitiy we have in our world, in this world, Humans are born with a spirit animal, and not in the symbolic sense, but a literal sense, each spirit animal is unique to that person, different in appearance, colour, personality and power, each spirit animal also has an elememt its linked to, as time goes by one can learn to harness and control their spirit animal and element, pushing themselves to a stage where they can physichally become their spirit animal, or their animal embodied by their element.\n\nThe more one masters their spirit animal, the more it becomes physichally shown, because only so many animals exist, different tribes and factions were form, congregating those of similar animal spirits, these soon became known as the Anamalia Factions, which ill get to soon, the physical display of one mastering their spirit animal is in the form of naturally occurring tribal like tattos, the tattos are the colour of the persons animal and the style is unqiue to that animal species, so many people can have the same type of tatto and colour, but what truly makes each unique is when they show off their mastery, using your elemental powers causes your tattos to glow and give off an aura of your element over them, for someone of a blue fire spirit their tattos would have blue flames emerging from them, purple earth would have like a cracked desert ground on them, commonly black with the respective colour illuminating the cracks.\n\nAlong with them having such unique powers, the majority of those who chose to master their abilities, chose to channel their energy through varying forms of martial arts and weaponary, they also tended to avoid most modern day weaponary like firearms and explosives as their own abilites rivalled that of a gun.\n\nAt night time, the tattos give off a distinct neon glow due to the lack of UV light hindering their energy movement, naturally your spirit has enough energy to constantly have your tattos in a state of \"aural display\" but the UV light hinders that, but at night time, they give off an beautiful clean glow (yes like that K/DA music video with the glowing face paint).\n\nA bonus that is gained from ones spirit animal come without requiring any training, the Aura that their spirit gives off forms a shield around their body, mind and soul, absorbing any damage and healing wounds, the amount of damage the aura can absorb or repair is dependent on the person.\n\nAs time has gone by an goverments used censuses to track and record the data of people's spirit animals, a trend was notcied... the Wolf was among one of them rarest spirit animals, Dragons, Snakes and Tigers being among the most common, in regards to elements, the most common being, Water, Fire and Earth, the rarest being Plasma and Lightning.\n\nFor each of the animals there is a faction, and with 6 divsions in the city, there are 6 respective factions which i shall now list below (these factions are basically like the chinese mafia out of tokyo drift, varying levels of activity), please note aswell, these factions do not represent the demographic of that section, its simply the faction that is the ruling gang of that section.\n\nDivsion 1, Capital Buisness Section: The Serpentine, Snake Faction, Led by Marcus Gaskov, Purple Shadow Snake Spirit, Negative Alignment, Criminal Activity.\n\nDivision 2, Retail Section: The Claw, Tiger Faction, Led by Emelia Jacobs, White Lightining Tiger Spirit, Positive Alignment, Lawful Activity.\n\nDivision 3, Highrise Apartments Section: Wings Of Fire, Dragon Faction, Led by Antonio Devari, Red Fire Dragon Spirit, Neutral Alignment, Vigilante Activity.\n\nDivsion 4, Residential Section: The Murder, Avian Faction, Led by Alex Murcs, Black Wind Crow Spirit, Negative Alignment, Criminal Activity.\n\nDivision 5, Industrial Section: Pride Of The People, Lion Faction, Led by Ben Jacobs, Orange Earth Lion Spirit, Positive Alignment, Civillian Activity.\n\nDivsion 6, Agricultural Section: Gods Of The Sky, Mythical Avians Faction, Led by Lauren Pol, Blue Water Thunderbird Spirit, Neutral Alignment, Civilian Activity.\n\nThere is a seventh faction that exists, but its a generalised one for those who train and master their spirits, but dont align with any faction, they are known as the Renegades, renegades mainly inhabit the tops of the city walls, and sometimes even outside the city walls.\n\nEach faction has control over a particular zone, how they choose to rule it is dictated by the mentality of the leader, each faction has its own form of deciding a leader, whether through strength, intelligence or agility, one trend is consistent, they all have to be adaptable to change to stay as the leader.\n\n***END WORLD OPENING***\n\nNow you maybe wondering how does this massive world, get turned into an RP, what plot is there to follow, and my answer to that is...who said there was a plot, it can be anything we want, maybe the Serpentine decide they want more than 1 section of the city, maybe the shadow beasts begin evolving and starting finding ways into the city, maybe a goverment agency begins targeting those who chose to enhance their abilities to maintain control of the population, its all up to you.\n\nNow how do you get into this RP, its pretty simply, your gonna need to create your own charachter, youll need to gather a ref pic, send a short bio, describe your spirit animal, colour and power, and then you get to choose your role.\n\nNow bear in mind, you aren't restricted to anything, if you want to be a leader of one of the factions, then you can, you can choose to make your own spirit setup, or use the ones already there, you dont have to use that leaders name either, but you will have to follow the factions alignment and animal types.\n\nIf your interested in exploring this world and roleplaying in it, then let me know, you can DM and ill provide my details for you and we can get this on the road.\n\nHope to hear from you all soon.",

I can try a hand at lit, but please have patience if you decide to go that route.\n\nI'd specifically be looking for someone to be Spike to my Buffy, (though I'd be up for an Angel) preferably romance rp with plot.

            "selftext": "Hello, fellow roleplayers! As the title says I'm looking for a Harry potter roleplay, specifically a DracoxHarry centered one. Juat a few things to get out of the way before we continue:\n\n- Be 18+ please. I'm in my mid twenties and I like some NSFW things, so appreciate someone or legal age. \n- I'd love it if you were able to write at least a paragraph in response. It kind of sucks to pour your heart into a reply and get one line in return. \n- Be aware that I have a full time job that restricts my reply time to mostly the evenings. Dont get mad at me for not being able to reply constantly \n- Use Discord. \n\nAnyways, with all that out of the way!! I'm looking for someone to play a Harry to my Draco. Post Hogwarts/war as well, somewhere at least 3 to 5 years after the Battle of Hogwarts. I love the idea of them being comfortable in their respective careers but not quite past the trauma from the war. I'm not super into the very end canon of Harry marrying Ginny and having kids and Draco marrying, so I'm open to tweak in that area. We can discuss that sort of stuff before we start.\n\nSo, if you're interested shoot me a PM and we can chat a bit and then move to Discord. Please dont send me a message just asking if I'm still looking. Write something about yourself, give me a bit of detail. =) cant wait to hear from some of you!",

            "selftext": "\"A lipstick lesbian is slang for a lesbian who exhibits a greater amount of feminine gender attributes relative to other gender expressions, such as wearing make-up, wearing dresses or skirts and having other characteristics associated with feminine women.\"\n\nSome people can't tell when a girl likes other girls at first glance. But that's fine, sometimes it's difficult. The stereotypical lesbian looks pretty trashy, admittedly. But there are those that take care of themselves, wear make up and perfume and don't drive trucks. Getting past that, the person themselves can act vastly different from what you'd expect.\n\nThis is the particular case of one girl who felt as though things around her love life would work themselves out, even though most of the people she associated with weren't exactly her type. Namely because they were guys that she knew through friends. She knew that she wasn't attracted to them, and was especially nice about it, and they left her alone about it. Until that one fateful day...\n\nBut that's getting ahead of things. At her school, she had a reputation of being nice to everyone and a fairly good student. When she caught wind of a rumor of a private school student coming to spend her last two years at her school, a public one. It wasn't a big deal to her, until she started at that school. The new girl, Cecil was her name, probably short for Cecilia, but no one ever asked. Her hair was long, wavy and jet black, decent sized body and a somewhat athletic body from snowboarding, an exotic sport in their little town where everyone knew everyone. She liked to wear short cut T-shirts, baggy jeans and sneakers, mostly just glad she didn't need to wear a uniform. \n\nOne day, Cecil came up to this girl in front of the school and tapped her on the shoulder. The sight of her sent this pour girl's heart aflutter, bringing along the butterflies in her stomach and the weakness in her knees. As a result, she couldn't answer the new girl's question, which resulted in her apologizing and moving to ask someone else. And these few things set in motion a turn of events she never could've expected in a million years.\n\n*So that's the prompt. The idea here is that your character is the old student who falls for my new student. Either yours could be the girly one and mine not, or vice versa, but either way mine will be the new girl. So yeah, if you're interested just send me your questions and stuff.*",

            "selftext": "Heya! Thanks for taking your time to read through this. I have lately been feeling like writing something slow-paced, long-term and comfy. By comfy, I mean my character is bartending. Your character(s) are coming to mine, and their stories may or may not intertwine and weave into each other. What I'm aiming for is something akin to VA-11 HALL-A. The game about bartending in a cyberpunk setting. I, of course, would be playing the bar-tender, and you could play a bunch of characters and we could have unique interactions, and our characters could truly share some heart-felt conversations on a spiritual level.\n\nWhat I, as a writer, can offer to you my dear friend, is the following:\n\n* Daily communication/chatter, roleplay.\n* I'll inform you of any inactivity/absence of mine.\n* Receptive of critique.\n* Regular replies and interesting character(s).\n* Great character introspective.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, here we are! Congratulations on making it this far, and I absolutely adore you for sticking through! If you're interested, please consider that I roleplay in third-person, past-tense and aim for detailed replies, but can match my partner in most, if not all cases! It's just important we click, really. :)",

            "selftext": "\"So you're the rookie they sent to follow me on my route, huh? What planet you from? Never heard of it. Just hop in and give me a light, will ya? Oh, and drink some of this scotch. You'll need it.\"\n\nWhen most people imagine a successful career, they don't think about being a glorified meter-maid in one of the universe's most expansive urban centers... but here you are. First day on the job, a tow-ship driver for the Planetary Parking Authority. You were always good at driving through heavy traffic and parallel parking, and you didn't have much going on in whatever 'career' you decided to leave behind, so it seemed like a natural fit. Decent pay, good pension, plus one week paid vacation a year. \n\nThey didn't tell you that part of the job was being chased around by crazed aliens from whatever God-forsaken corner of the galaxy who aren't particularly happy about their vehicles being towed and hauled off to impound. Oh, and most of them are armed with laser guns.\n\nSomebody's gotta do it. Traffic on the planet is absolutely horrendous and there's hardly any space on the streets. The underground lightrail system is crumbling and full of hooligans who are fond of jumping passengers for their wallets, leaving it a less-than-viable mode of transportation. Walking is an option, but let's be realistic... who the hell wants to walk anywhere?\n\nYou'll be hauling cars, trucks, bikes, and spacecraft from all manner of folk. Poor people from the public housing stacks, rich people from the luxury hotels uptown, androids from the red light district, and alien tourists from just about every planet you can dream of. And, of course, you'll be fighting them off when they decide to put up resistance.\n\nYour partner is a guy named Jack. He's from Earth, which is something not too many people can claim these days. Who knows how he ended up here. The stubble on his face and the whiskey in his coffee are a pretty solid indicator of how the job's treating him, but he seems to be friendly enough if a bit rough around the edges. After work, you guys head to this-or-that bar to grab a beer, eat some hot wings, and watch the Deathball game. \n\nThis is a story about the burnout of a stressful job, a friendship formed in dire circumstances, and coming to terms with one's lot in life. Will you come to accept your place as a cog in the machine of a dystopian bureaucracy? Will you play it by the book or act as a loose cannon? Will you ever learn more about your grizzled tow-partner? That's all for you to decide.\n\nRomance is fine if it's a M x F pairing, but it's not necessary to the plot. Male writers and characters are encouraged, I always love a good bromance. I don't write smut. If you're interested, shoot me a DM and I'll give you my Discord. We can chat character and worldbuilding ideas!",

He looked a bit haggard, the cloth on his armor torn in places, and looking as if it had been through the wringer. The cloth was also stained, both with blood and mud, and the plates that he wore on his shoulders and across his chest were dented, with one ragged tear in the middle of the pauldron on his shoulder. Beside him, his shield was chipped, with one side of it being broken, and deep gouges in the wood.  His longsword had chips and nicks up and down the blade and looked in desperate need of sharpening.\n\nThe Warrior's body matched his equipment. He was shorter than average, standing at perhaps 5'6\", and looked to weigh 200 pounds. His face was worn, with a scraggly traveling beard, scruffy from lack of shaving rather than style. He had a deep scar stretching from his throat down below his shirt and armor. His hands were calloused, with a deep scar on the top of his right hand. His eyes were a deep forest green, and his skin was weathered both from battle and the elements.\n\nHe stared into his mug of mead, trying to relax from the last job he had been on.  He was exhausted, and ready to rest, starting with an order of ham and a large mug of mead.\n\nAnd he started to eat, he heard the door to the tavern open and glanced back, wondering who might be there.\n\nHello everyone, I thought I might make a new prompt that was more fantasy focused. \n\nIf you like my prompt and have an idea, please feel free to shoot me a message!",

            "selftext": "Hi there! My name is Sam, and since you're reading this, I assume you're at least somewhat interested in what I'm offering. I'm offering you the chance to live in a fantasy world, full of magic, monsters, fights, love, and lots of chaos. In fact, you can even help design it!\n\nAlright, now that that's out of the way, let me explain what I actually mean by all that up there. I've had a fledgeling idea for a plot bouncing between my three brain cells, and I need someone to help me build on it. I've been watching and reading a lot of magic-based things recently, (namely Black Clover, No Game No Life, and a book called The Revenge of Magic) and I want to mash some of those together and sprinkle just a bit of originality on top. My biggest problem with expanding this idea into a full-blown plot is the originality part. I don't just want to do a fandom rp, because that's pretty boring to me, but I'm not actually all that creative, so it's difficult to move it away from the base materials.\n\nLet's move on to what I offer as a partner. \nIf you choose to take pity on me and lend me a hand, you'll find that I'm a semi-literate, extremely active partner. I'm honestly able to reply at almost any time of day, particularly because I don't sleep much at night. I can usually give you a good couple paragraphs per reply, depending on how much I'm given to work with. Overall, I'm not the worst writer, and make up for my faults with friendly conversations outside the rp. \n\nNow, who am I?\nFor some people, it's important to know who's on the other end of the chat. This section is a short insight to who that is. As I said above, my name is Sam, and I'm a 15 (almost 16) year old nerd. I'm currently a sophomore in highschool, and have been rejected by many on this sub because of it. Despite being in my \"angsty teen\" years, I'm a relatively nice person to talk to, or so I've been told. Honestly, that's all I can think to write out here, but if you want to know more, shoot me a message, and ask me questions. Now, just to make sure you've read through all of this, I'm going to need you to include your favorite book in your first message, or I'm not going to respond.\n\nWhat am I looking for in a partner?\nI like to think my restrictions aren't as tight as most others make them. For example, I don't care about your age, so long as you write well. I'm really just looking for you to write as well as I do, and that's really not that hard to do. I am going to need you to be okay with not having much of anything sexual in the story. If sex must happen, the most I can do there is a fade-to-black on start. I love romance, and encourage that, but I'm not up for writing any sex scenes out. Sorry if that scares you off, but that's the way it has to be. I also need you to be pretty decent at worldbuilding, and willing to help me design this land. Now, the final and most constricting rule of mine: you need to have a good sense of humor. I like to make jokes. A lot. They aren't all very good jokes, either. I need a partner who will joke around with me, and who will forgive me for any jokes that fall flat.\n\nNow, if you're still here, and have read all of this plea for help, send me a message. I'd love to hear what ideas you have. I'll be waiting for you!",

            "selftext": "Hey there!\n\nLet\u2019s start with the basics:\n\u2022I\u2019m 20, so I ask that my partners are strictly 18+.\n\u2022I\u2019m in the central time zone, so it\u2019s a plus if you are in the same time zone or one nearby.\n\u2022I\u2019ve been role-playing on and off for around eight years and writing for even longer than that.\n\u2022Discord is my preferred platform and I write in third person past tense.\n\u2022As much as I would love to role-play as much as possible each day, I must warn you that I will not always be able to be super active. I\u2019m a full time undergraduate student balancing two jobs at the moment. But with that being said, I can promise that you will get at least a few replies on my super busy days. I\u2019ll always do my best to be as active as I can without compromising my real life responsibilities.\n\u2022If you want to strictly role-play, that is completely fine. However, I love OOC chatter and making friends with my RP partners.\n\nAs for the role-play I have in mind:\n\u2022I have done a few RPs with partners playing Snape, although I have found that they struggle to play his personality accurately. They typically sugarcoat his character and neglect to play out his cold, firm demeanor. My ideal partner would be able to accurately play his character.\n\u2022This will be a slow burn romance RP between Hazel Hawthorne (an OC) and Severus Snape, with lots of conflict along the way and after they get together.\n\u2022The plot of this role-play will stray quite a bit from the canon plot, but it will be set before Voldemort has resurfaced\u2014and before Snape rejoins the Death Eaters as a double agent.\n\u2022Hazel Hawthorne was a former student of Severus\u2019. She was his favorite student, although he would never admit that. Hazel used to give him a lot of trouble during his class because she was one of the only students that did not fear him. But, she was also incredibly gifted in potions as well. In fact, she was so gifted that Severus expected her to become his apprentice.\n\u2022Because of his expectations for Hazel, Severus was sorely disappointed when he learned that she had decided to pursue herbology. Little did he know, it had been her lifelong dream to study the healing properties of magical plants. By devoting her life to the light side of herbology, she hoped to break free from the dark work of her father.\n\u2022Harvey Hawthorne, Hazel\u2019s father, was a Hogwarts dropout. He never returned for his seventh year, choosing instead to devote his life to experimenting with some of the most lethal plants to ever grow on this earth. Albus Dumbledore was well-aware of what had happened to Harvey, so he made sure to keep a close eye on Hazel during her time at Hogwarts\u2014fearing that she would go down a similar path to her father. However, Albus quickly saw that she was nothing like her father.\n\u2022In the summer before her seventh year, Hazel\u2019s father was killed by one of his experiments that went wrong. Hazel was the one to find him and ultimately kill the plant herself.\n\u2022Five years after graduating and her explosive falling out with Professor Snape after he learned of her post-Hogwarts plans, Hazel was asked to return to Hogwarts. Albus had offered her a position as the herbology professor and Head of Hufflepuff, as Madam Sprout had chosen to leave the school.\n\u2022Severus was horribly cold\u2014even more so than usual\u2014when Hazel returned. He pledged to ignore her as much as possible, although it was difficult at times when he needed herbs from her greenhouse for his potions.\n\u2022A couple months into the term, strange plants began appearing around the school. On the same day that the first plant was spotted, violence escalated in the school. The first day there were a few fights. The following day had over ten. The next had over twenty. Albus brings Hazel and Severus together to figure out what the plants are and how to get rid of them. They will have to work together in order to restore order in the school. But more importantly, they need to find out who is responsible for putting these plants on the school grounds.\n\n[Link to my OC Hazel Hawthorne](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-3JSNAURAvyT1yo4C7jBzQJQq086awSqem9ACYauLM4)\n\nSend me a DM if this role-play interests you and then we can move over to Discord to discuss any more details.

            "selftext": "***UPDATED!***\n\nI\u2019m looking for a partner that can consistently write with me and build along an adventure/romance/western story with. Hopefully long term to some extent!\n\nPlot-wise,  my intention is the idea of working alongside the Van Der Linde gang's  story and along  the timeline of RDR2. I feel like characters (that  aren\u2019t Arthur as we see through his eyes all the time) seeing the game\u2019s events and setting could just really be an interesting thing. The cast  is so great and the group's dynamic is honestly one of the best parts of  the game.\n\nAs far as characters to  be played\u2014I\u2019m basically open to anything. I don\u2019t like telling partners  who to play, so I\u2019m certainly not requiring a specific character to be  played. Want a canon? That\u2019s cool! Want an original? That\u2019s cool too!  But like, I\u2019m just saying, if you wanted to write Charles you\u2019d probably be the *coolest*.  As for myself, I write primarily female characters (but can NPC  anyone). I have some ideas for some original  characters. But I\u2019m also  finding myself enjoying Abigail so I\u2019m down for playing her as well. I\u2019d  probably have to explore any other female canon as an NPC before committing to fully writing them. The rest of the group would likely be NPC-ed collectively by us as well.\n\nWhile  my idea is probably a little vague. There\u2019s just a lot of room to do things with other gang members. What\u2019s going on while Arthur is  doing his thing. This starting from the beginning right up in the   mountains with us picking and choosing adventures and scenarios along   the way. How do they spend the time at camp while he\u2019s gone, what jobs  are they running without him, and so-forth. There\u2019s also room for  characters outside of the gang (it\u2019s just fun to be an outlaw)! Of  course, also the ability to change around some events from the story to  suit whatever we wanna do. We can even take jobs and encounters originally done by Arthur if it works as well.\n\nI want to  stay true to the setting and also have a lot of the elements of the   Wild West. The particular themes can be discussed on discord. But as this request is tagged as NSFW, I would like to have a partner that is also interested in those higher rated themes as I am as well. I\u2019m not looking for such  content to be the primary focus.... but maybe the secondary one! Aside from that I do want quality plotting and writing because the RDR2 world is so gorgeously put together.\n\nTo end it\u2014I only RP on discord. I write  in third person past tense and would prefer a partner that did as well. Quality writing is important to me, please use proper capitalization, punctuation, and grammar. New paragraphs for new speakers! Long or shorter posts are fine with me.\n\nI\u2019d really prefer a partner that knows the Red Read universe and its characters reasonably well. As well as a partner that wants to add their own ideas as well. Also I require someone who enjoys  chatting regularly OOC too because I don\u2019t like not interacting with people I  write with. I like there to be some regularity with posting\u2014if I\u2019m  waiting around for over a week for a reply I get bored.\n\nPartners also have to be 21+! Don\u2019t message me if you\u2019re not. DMs only please and just let me know any  questions or ideas you might have!",

            "selftext": "Lucas panted as he felt the scorching sun scour his back, the leather of his armor stuck to his back like it had been melted into his skin, and would definitely need to be peeled off of him. However, even with the soreness and exhaustion, he was still in a far better state than his opponent.  He watched the man in front of him slump into the sand, the eyes of his enemy slowly closing as he breathed his last breath, blood that moments before had been pumping out of the wound that Lucas had landed on his neck now slowly do a rapidly diminishing stream. The warrior had put up quite the fight, and it had been all that Lukas could do to hang on in certain parts of the battle, dodging and evading the man's deadly spear, constantly working closer to strike with his blade. \n\nBut ultimately all that mattered was that he was here now, standing over the body of his opponent, the crowd cheering and screaming for him. The Gladius felt heavy in his hand, and the shield in his other felt like it was made of granite. But still, he felt absolutely electrified by the crowd's screaming and chanting his name, so loud in fact that he felt it vibrate his body. That vibration, that incredible volume, was something that he couldn't help but relish.  It meant he had survived.  And more than that, he had won.\n\nWith that in mind, he circled the arena, waving to the crowd and letting them touch his hand before walking back to the pits below, making way for the next gladiators.\n\n\n\nHello everyone, I hope you liked my post.  I am up for most anything, and we can tweak this prompt a few different ways.  I also play on here, discord, and kik.",

I\u2019d love to figure out a rp we can both enjoy! I have some fandoms I love to rp like Harry Potter, but I\u2019m pretty open to anything at the moment so feel free to message me your ideas or just your kik or ask for mine!
