I RP solely on discord and would prefer to use that only. \n\n\\- On the East Coast but I'm very flexible with posting. You'll receive timely responses from me unless I let you know otherwise. \n\n\\- A person who enjoys lots of characters. I prefer if our characters are not in fishbowls and we have plenty of side characters, NPCs, and so on. A very dynamic story!\n\n\\- A person fine with NSFW and smut, I have a few limits but most people find me pretty lenient and I'm cool with most things. \n\n\\- A person that thinks communication is key. If you're not having fun please let me know (I ask regularly throughout our RP time together) and that way we can either regroup or just decide to go our separate ways. I would much rather us part kindly rather than you simply ghosting me. \n\nI like low fantasy modern, sci-fi plots, slice of life, futuristic, romance, dark and gritty plots, plots with tons of angst, and even incredibly overly fluffy and sweet plots. All I ask is that there are no fandoms. Whether you want to pitch to me a plot you've been having in your head or you want to collaborate on something fun, let's discuss it. I even saw a few months ago that a person was willing to take over plots of partners who had been ghosted--and that's such an incredible offer to people that I think would be fun to do so if you have a story you were excited to do and your partner ghosted you then send it my way and maybe we can pick up that plot together! \n\nMessage me your discord and send any plots my way. If you have no ideas yet, still shoot me a PM and let's start plotting!",

I have some ideas, but I'm also open to hearing what you're into!\n\nI exclusively roleplay on discord and in third person. I really want to keep everything modern, and realistic, no fantasy or sci-fi aspects. As far as drama, angst, and different road bumps I'm very open to things that can happen.

I'm trying a new approach to this today.\u00a0\n\nI have some availability and am looking to add another rp partner on Discord, someone I click with and who brings the same passion for our characters and story that I will. I'd prefer if you could reply at least once a day, or keep me updated if you can't. I'm also looking for someone 20+, so we both feel comfortable exploring dark/mature themes.\n\nNow for the fun part! I'm going to list some of my original characters and the genres/scenarios I've used them in before. I'm certainly open to changing things up and developing them for different kinds of stories, but this is just to get the ideas flowing.\u00a0\n\n| Adaline\u00a0|A loner in her early to mid twenties. Cursed by the beast from \u2018Beauty and the Beast.\u2019 The curse is something similar to lycanthropy. For this reason, she starts off by living somewhere secluded, but eventually sets out to find a cure. The idea is that there are others like her, who are cursed by fairytale characters. (fairytale, mystery, magical, modern)\n\n| Davina\u00a0|An ethereal woman in her mid twenties. She\u2019s a fallen angel, in a city where magic and mythos thrive in the underground. An entertainer at a burlesque club, she becomes a witness to a crime, resulting in her being swept up into an ongoing investigation. (supernatural, crime, mystery, modern)\n\n| Abigail\u00a0|A scrappy young woman, eighteen to early twenties. From a political family, who are assassinated when she\u2019s young. She wants to grow up to be an assassin herself, to find out who killed her parents. She\u2019s willing to become half machine to achieve her goals. (cyberpunk, action, futuristic)\n\n| Nina\u00a0|A Native American woman in her mid twenties. She\u2019s on the run from her ex-boyfriend and his rez gang. Takes whatever jobs she can to make her way from town to town. (crime, slice of life, modern)\n\nSo, let me know which character you'd like me to play! Feel free to come with entirely new ideas, or one of the ones I have listed. I look forward to your messages!",

I\u2019ve been having a hard time finding a decent partner to rp with. Just please while you take the time to read this give me to show you I can be a good partner. I have a couple of good plots I would like to try out if anyone is interested. If you have a plot that you would wanna try out I am open to that. I believe that when rping is something two people should be able to enjoy together so I\u2019m open to a lot of stuff. I wanted to combine genre of cyberpunk but give it a small twist to it. I have a few plot ideas I would like to mess with. I just got ghosted recently so I\u2019m at a point now where I just wanna dip my head in a fryer. So if you are serious and willing to commit to this rp I would appreciate it a lot....if not please don\u2019t waste my time.\n\nThis is something different from the game Itself. This takes place in a Neo Tokyo  was thinking about a drug which would boost a person's rage; a kind of \"berserk drug\". The drug would make people feel great and invincible- increasing their violent tendencies. This would spread like wildfire in society, my character who is merc who was once with the syndicate but cut his ties with them.He now takes odd jobs around neo Tokyo while bounty hunting. (Your character) would be what oracle is to batman. Being able to scan areas for him and helping him get through certain. Obstacles with hacking. As for the plot I wanted to base it on the everyday life of bounty hunting and taking jobs from crime bosses and stuff of that caliber. I also wanna create lore around this story and focus on character back stories and stuff like that: if you are interested please dm me. [[[[if for some reason you do not like this idea we can come up with something completely new that can be different to the plot ]]]]]]]\n\nWARNING: if you do choose to dm me and want to partake in this rp please be serious and committed to it. I\u2019m starting to get tired of people wanting to do this rp then disappear and ghost me... I need a serious partner that is willing to expand this rp and enjoy writing a story for it.",

It\u2019s likely what I spend the most of my time on. Essentially I\u2019m looking to develop a roleplay with people who enjoy establishing them just as much. \n\nIn terms of specifics, my favorite genre is fantasy, but I do enjoy others and I\u2019m generally flexible. I also enjoy having multiple characters (that can either be male or female). Lately I\u2019ve been wanting to try doing a D&amp;D inspired roleplay format, so if you\u2019d like to try that out with me I\u2019d be happy to elaborate. \n\nI think that\u2019s all I have to say! If any of y\u2019all have questions, I will answer them a soon as possible. Otherwise, I hope this post finds you well!",

            "selftext": "I\u2019m looking for a (hopefully) long term partner for 1x1 Discord adventure/romance/western fun set in RDR2\u2019s Van Der Linde Gang. I know the request got kind of long but I hope it\u2019s all important to know!\n\nPartner Requirements\n\n* 21+ or older that is also interested and relatively enthused about NSFW content.\n* Someone that likes to also chat OOC! Be my friend!\n* Quality third person (past tense preferred) writing with proper grammar.\n* A partner that knows the RDR setting and RDR2 reasonably well. I don\u2019t want to be talking about characters and plot points and have to wait for someone to google it. I\u2019d like to be able to be like \u201chey let\u2019s do something at Butcher\u2019s Creek\u201d and they know what I\u2019m talking about.\n* Someone who posts regularly, once a week doesn\u2019t keep me engaged enough.\n* Someone who reads this whole request and doesn't ask me \n\nNow, plot-wise my intention is working along the timeline of RDR2 following the Van Der Linde gang. I think it would be really fun to further explore the gang and its members, as well as likely, add a handful of original characters to the mix. The group\u2019s dynamic was my favorite part of the game and being able to take a step away from Arthur who was on his own so much leaves a lot of room to have adventures. I loved the opening in the mountains so the gang almost freezing is definitely where I want to kick off the RP.\n\nAs far as characters to be played. This is going to be focused on the gang, so all the gang members will be included. But most of them will likely just be NPC-ed by both of us. Unless you wanted to main Strauss, I\u2019m not going to judge. I\u2019m cool with whatever a partner wants to play because I don\u2019t like telling people who to play (but like if you just happen to like and want to write Charles you\u2019d become my *favorite person ever*). With original characters, my one requirement is... don\u2019t just regurgitate a canon character into an original because you don\u2019t want to play a canon!\n\nIf you want to play some basic white guy outlaw... you may as well just play John or Arthur or Bill or Sean or Micah. Bring something new to the table if you\u2019re going with original.\n\nAs for myself, I write primarily female characters (but intend on NPC-ing anyone needed). I have a few concepts for roles that are missing in the gang for original characters. But I\u2019ll also be writing Abigail and will probably explore playing other female canons if my partner didn\u2019t want to write them (just can\u2019t commit until I play around with them a bit). In general, I figure both myself and my partner will be playing multiple characters.\n\nWhile the idea itself is a little vague... there\u2019s a lot of room to do things with the gang while Arthur\u2019s off hunting legendary animals. Jobs we can have them run, cons, accidents, things that happen at camp. And, of course, putting our own spin on major game events and creating new ones. We can even take jobs and encounters from Arthur.\n\nSorry that this got kind of long! If you\u2019re interested please send me a DM! It\u2019d be helpful if in the DM you let me know if you\u2019re interested in any canons or what sort of character you\u2019re thinking of (or if you wanted to build any together). Plus, tell me your favorite game quote for fun! Thanks for sticking it though!",

            "selftext": "Romance. Build up. Tension. Cliches that make you go \"Pfff, that's dumb\" out loud, but deep down you know they are a guilty pleasure.\n\nYou name it, I'm a sucker for it all in my roleplays - whether it's a forbidden romance of sort, or an innocent, almost naive one, I enjoy the characters to be involved in something one way or another. That being said, however, romance doesn't have to be the very main thing. In fact, despite my liking for romantic aspects, I strongly believe that without something else sprinkled on top, any kind of romance falls flat sooner or later. So whether we are coming up with a story set in a fantasy world, a modern one, or something within the cyberpunk genre (or something else entirely), action and plot going beyond the lovey-dovey stuff are more than welcome. Needed, even! \n\nI'm looking for someone over the age of 18, preferably 25+ - whether you are a male or a female doesn't matter - who doesn't shy away from romance in their roleplays, wishes to roleplay as a male and is willing to admit that yes, there exist guilty pleasures worth exploring. Additionally, I tend to write a post per day (length doesn't matter that much, though descriptions are always welcome!), sometimes more; and I am hoping to find someone who is willing to keep a similar pace.\n\nI am currently most interested in something fantasy-based, with some machinations and such involved (might be taking place within a royal family, the court, etc.)\n\nIf you're interested, shoot me a message.",

His cloak was itching his neck, but he fought the temptation to scratch it. \u201cMen do not scratch themselves at court,\u201d his father had told him before they entered the hall, \u201cit is weak. And these great lords eat weakness.\u201d The boy hadn\u2019t known what it meant at the time, but looking around the Great Hall, he knew. All around him were huge men, some even bigger than his father. All with great big beards, and with long, well kept hair. Many had scars. Some not entirely healed. Reminders of the war that had only recently ended. The war which had taken the kneeling young man\u2019s father. The young man stood.\n\nHe was tall and lean, with long, night-black hair. He had a mournful face, long and sad. His dark eyes seemed sad too. This man is sad, the boy thought, maybe someone should cheer him up. His forehead glistened from the hot oil which the priest had just anointed him with. He was naked, save for the bear cloak draped around his shoulders. The cloak which the boy\u2019s father had said was worn by this man\u2019s ancestors for generations and generations.\n\nAs the iron and bronze crown of his people was placed on the man\u2019s head, another man spoke. \u201cAll hail, Brandon the Fourth, King of the Mountains, the Lakes, and of the Bears. Lord of Appalach and of the Eastern Seas. Long may he reign!\u201d The heralder\u2019s voice echoed through the stones which made up the hall.\n\n\u201cAll hail!\u201d The crowd boomed back, as they fell to their knees. All except the boy, who remained standing. That is, until his father yanked him to the ground, forcing him to kneel.\n\n\u201cRise, all,\u201d the new king said. The crowd in the hall rose, and the King, Brandon turned his back to the crowd, their invitation to leave the hall, until dinner, that is.\n\nAs they entered the courtyard outside, the young boy tugged on his father\u2019s cloak. \u201cFather?\u201d\n\nThe boy\u2019s father looked down at his young son.\n\n\u201cWhy is King Brandon the King of the Bears?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is said,\u201d Father said, smiling warmly at the child, \u201c that when the first Bear King came to this land so many hundreds of years ago, he was no king, but just a man. A man who had lived before the collapse. He had lead a band of fellow survivors into these woods, and settled on Wood\u2019s Hill in the dead of winter because of the hot springs here, which kept his party warm. When the spring came, the man discovered that there was a bear, who had been asleep all winter. This bear was angry at the man for stealing his only source of warmth this far North. So, the first king challenged the bear to combat. The first to die would have the springs for himself. So they fought, and the man killed the bear, and skinned it. When he wore put on the bear\u2019s skin, thunder spoke, and, according to legend, the thunder said \u2018KING!\u2019 It is on that very spot that we stand. The same hill where the first king, Brandon the First, killed that bear and was declared king so many years ago. And from that day forward, those who wore the Iron Crown and who sat on the Bear Throne were called the Bear King.\u201d\n\n\u201cHas any king killed a bear since?\u201d The boy asked, amazed at the story.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d the boy\u2019s father laughed, his breath frosting in front of him, \u201cbut they have conquered many more bear\u2019s lands since. And maybe one day this new Young Bear will kill a bear of his own.\u201d  \n\\_\\_\\_\n\nLooking for someone to RP in this world with. I have a couple of ideas for an RP.

            "selftext": "Hey hey fellow people, so do I have a cool idea for you! First off I'll give some info on me, I'm 21 currently finishing my last year of College, I am pretty sarcastic and like to joke around a lot. I enjoy to speak in OOC, especially about the story in case you're curious on what way to go about it or have any questions.. general conversation is nice as well. I'm EST so having someone in that time would be my preference, I'm also a night owl so most times to RP work for me.\n\nNow onto the RP and specifics about it. Third person is a preference but it can be talked about, if you can play more than one character that would be great too (Obviously you'd be mostly playing the main character you'd make)! Someone who can write typically in longer forms and not give short responses, smut will be involved with the story but takes a back seat to everything that's going on and won't be very common. I'd also like to build much more of the world and characters with someone, creating a nice story line and I'm open to ideas and feedback!\n\nThe world is this. Years ago Dungeons opened up, these large portals leading to a whole separate worlds, frozen areas, caves, castles with demons and much much more. At this time people had seemed to awaken, granting them powers above normal Humans. Things such as more Strength, Speed, Faster Healing and Durability.. this was uncommon but everyone was rated with a class system. Starting at E and up to S class, but the highest being National level Hunters.. very few of these exist. These people were known as Hunters and took on multiple different roles, some with the ability to produce powerful fire magic, others serving as the front line to fend off these monsters or others deciding to become Rogues.. hiding in the shadows waiting to strike.\n\nThese Dungeons also had a system to them, ranked from E to S with S tier Dungeons being almost so incredibly rare only one was ever seen so far. Guilds hold power within their respective Countries, serving as a common place for Hunters to meet and defeat Dungeons. Taking resources from these Dungeons to sell or craft into better equipment for Hunters or outside corporations.\n\nThis is a brief idea of the RP, if anything I can provide tons more details and answer any questions you have! Also I'd prefer to use Discord as for me it's the easiest option. Bonus points if you know what this is based off of!",

Experience is not required and my age is already posted in the title, so if you aren\u2019t comfortable with roleplaying with someone my age, I\u2019m not the one for you.\n\nI personally have been roleplaying for a little over three years, so if you are afraid of roleplaying with a newbie, you won\u2019t with me. The only thing I ask is that my partner be able to respond in more than a couple sentences (although other times will call for small responses).

            "selftext": "I am looking for a literate partner for a fantasy (and slightly steam punk) roleplay. The story would be set on a fictional world with no humans; instead the story follows the lives of aelves, similar to humans in most ways but having subtle differences. The story will follow a young soldier promoted into the ranks of a secretive group investigating the very old and very dangerous mysteries surrounding the world. The setting revolves around a great war occurring between two nations. The vague atmosphere takes a good deal of inspiration from India during its time under the British Empire. Magic is present but rather rare in this RP.\n\nI imagine the RP being quite adventure focussed, with lots of characters to meet and befriend and lots of locations to explore. It will be centered around the crew of an airship, who you will get to know and form friendships with. I'm looking forward to discussing ideas you might have regarding your character and building them into the story. \n\n\nRegarding romance, I don\u2019t write characters with the goal of them being love interests, instead I wait and see if there\u2019s any organic chemistry. It makes for more believable and slow-burn relationships that way. I do definitely want there to be some romance in the rp though.\n\nI roleplay exclusively on discord and can manage about one reply a day, sometimes less, sometimes more. I often write 2-3 paragraphs, and while I don\u2019t expect you to match me I would like more than just a few lines from you.\n\nIf you could include a writing sample, that would be great. Please don't hesitate to get in touch.",

            "selftext": "**Introduction:**\nHello, I'm an amateur writer who loves to create worlds and characters and i have recently joined a discord Rp server and man is it teeming with lore! So I'm here to make a proposition to you!\n\n**Background Information:**\nSo like i said in the introduction, i recently found this nice little RP Discord Server (54 ppl) and i fell in love with the lore and story of their world. I won't spoil it for any avid readers who want to take a look for yourselves, but it boils down to a fantasy world full of magic, politics, history and demographics!\n\nNow why would i advertise this as a story if it's already written?\nWell, because whilst some of it is, i want to help expand it and make new stories out of it. \n\nThe lore is dense and painstakingly designed with a certain aesthetic in mind. It's in my opinion one of the best source material I've encountered, BUT it needs a little more. It's needs to go from an RP (which i really am not against, i take part in it myself) to a story. For that i need writer(s) because whilst i can write, i am still an amateur at best. So, I'm looking for anyone that would like to join me on my quest to make the lore of their world a story.\n\n**Details:**\nUnfortunately, payment is not involved since this is essentially a passion project and won't be commercialized.\nThis is not my creation, it is someone else's that i joined and i want to fledge out more because I really liked it\nYou can either look at my personal notes of the world's lore or look at it yourself, I'll link the server below :)\n*Looking at the original source is always better!*\nWe can collaborate with the creators for inspiration or to fact-check what we write\n\nFor more information please feel free to contact me whenever you like!\n\n**Closing Statement:**\nI'd like to thank anyone who reads this, considers it or becomes a part of it. Because of people like you more stories like these pop up! Also feel free to comment, pm, join the server or get a hold of me if you want to become a part of this or the server! Thank you!\n\n**Server Link:**\nhttps://discord.gg/uKHDmBG",

Of course you took care of your image, after all it sold just as well as the music.\nParties with lots and lots of action, fashion trendsetting every time you left the house in something...\n\nYou were the opposite of who I was.\nI was just some guy who was not really in the right headspace for anything at all but making music. People titled me to be the new Cobain, others thought I was just a whimp with an aggressive music style, whatever I did we were always the misfits no matter where we got to. However that just gave us one big advantage: there are so many misfits out there, and all of a sudden we were big players in the music world. Anti pop, anti commercial, anti everything.\n\nThat is until that fateful night where we end up at one table...\n\n\n______________\n\nHey glad to see you came so far. I'm basically envisioning a romance between two colliding worlds, think popstars like Ariana Grande, Camila Cabello, or Rihanna at the one hand and guys like Cobain, Billy idol etc on the other.

            "selftext": "Hello all! I'm craving a good story. I want to create a well-written romance between a monster character and my human, a blind girl called Lilith. You have a choice of what monster you'd like to be! Obviously I'll need you to be humanoid (vampire, naga/lamia, fallen angel, harpy or whatever) so I'm not really looking for furries or straight up orcs, sorry lol. I'll tell you a little about myself 'cause I should probably let you know what I'm getting into.\n\nI'm not the best at keeping plots going so I will need some help there. If you're willing to take the lead and/or brainstorm with me, I'd be very grateful. I'm also very picky when it comes to writing. I'm sorry TwT This will be a novella roleplay written in third person, multiple paragraph style. I go from three to six or seven paragraphs per post. I'd like you to try and match me. \n\nI'd like this to be a romantic, passionate and somewhat dramatic roleplay. One thing I'm absolutely against is your character being the \"tsundere\" type. Show some emotion! Don't shut my character down upon meeting her because that leaves me with nothing to write &gt;_&lt; be receptive! Another thing I'm not into is plots that center around, yknow, that thing I can't mention without my post being removed. So this is a clean roleplay! Sorry to disappoint anyone looking for that stuff e_e.\n\nPreference wise, I'd like you to be a vampire (what can I say? Cliches are fun) but you're welcome to be whatever you want.\n\nIdeally I'd like to roleplay on discord, but I also have kik, Google hangouts and email. I can't roleplay on reddit, I'm sorry qwq. That being said, I hope to hear from you!",

            "selftext": "Adrian had been sitting in the waiting room for what had felt like hours. His father had recently passed away. His long fought battle with cancer had finally come to an end. That, however, was not the end of fight for everyone. Even after his father had been pronounced dead Adrian had stayed. The hospital staff trying multiple times to check in on him. All being received with the same cold silence. After what felt like an eternity when it was in fact only a few hours Adrian\u2019s body seemed to move in its on. \n\nHe saw the cars pass, he felt the wind as it blew against him; yet he didn\u2019t truly register it. His mind felt like a maze with no end. After every turn was another block. Another stop along his journey. That was until he saw a man sitting on the edge of a bridge. The crystal clear water below him flowing still as glass. The grass around him alive and green. It seemed that whatever was near this man was perfection. As such Adrian found himself drawing closer. \n\nThe man never turned around, he simply bit into an apple that seemed to turn up from his own pocket. Biting into it Adrian heard the crunch as if he had taken it himself. The man chewed, swallowed, and without even turning addressed him. \n\n\u201cWhat would you do to get your father back...\u201d\n\nThe man slowly started to turn towards him and the world seemed to warp. He smelled brimstone, felt heat, and sensed dread as the man continued to turn. His voice growing dark and seemingly having a guttural tone to it. \n\n\u201cOr should I say, what would you sell.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nHey all, I am back. I\u2019ll go through the normal spiel but this time a little different. I am not the best at grammar if you\u2019re not either that\u2019s fine. As long as you got some of the basics down that\u2019s fine by me. Do not hit me up if you\u2019re looking for a quick smut section just to ghost me. I never felt like I would ever have to write that, but god is it so prominent. Another thing, I have a strict no SO policy for my writers. No it isn\u2019t because I want to turn you into my girlfriend. It\u2019s just a respect thing for me. I\u2019m looking for someone who has dealt with something like this IRL as well. It isn\u2019t a deal breaker but I want this to be a dark, emotion felt roleplay. \n\nHope to see orange boxes, love you all thanks for reading.",

If you desire, your \u201cEve\u201d can even be a trained field agent, whatever you want. I have zero interest in playing as or against the canons.  I could be talked into switching the roles as well. \n\nI want it to start as the show does but of course everything can be tweaked to our liking. While this will be a \u201cromantic\u201d ship it will be, uh, skewed. It\u2019s not going to be sunshine and daisies. Having said that I don\u2019t want it to stray into abuse-territory so some nuance will be involved. Naturally this will require both of us playing side characters from time to time to keep the plot going forward and influence the plot. I am only interested in the ship being FxF or FxN-B. \n\nI need patience. It\u2019s great that people can promise 5+ replies a day but I work full time and have other things I both need and want to do. So if you \u201c\u201drequire\u201d\u201d multiple daily posts, I\u2019m not the one.\n\nLast few things; I only write on discord and I need face claims. Commissions of art of your character that were drawn for you are fine. I need my partner to be 21+. I am not looking for fade to black themes right now; if something comes up I\u2019d prefer to write it out but NOT be the focus !\n\nIf interested DM ONLY. Chats and comments will be ignored. I\u2019ll need a writing sample from you and I will send one of my own as well.",

I don\u2019t have a specific plot in mind, definitely open to ideas! I do prefer playing female and I like playing opposite of a male (your actual gender doesn\u2019t matter) and I\u2019m open to doubling! \n\nSome sub elements I like are forbidden/unlikely romance, drama and suspense, character development and tragedy, things like that. I also like having it set in fun eras like medieval, old western, futuristic, whatever. \n\nI use Discord mainly and 3rd person but I\u2019m not stuck on either. I can only pick one roleplayer as I already have another roleplay going so please send me a message that says something about you or your plot ideas or whatever really!",

            "selftext": "**Hello! Before you read any further, this RP will not be based on a typical one-on-one partnership. Instead, it will consist of a DM-to-Player partnership, much like D&amp;D or other tabletop games. There will be no rolling, stats, or anything of that nature. I vastly prefer this style of writing (as have most of my past partners) because it allows for much better storytelling, character development, and a world that feels more alive.**\n\n**If you're looking for more of a sandbox roleplay with your character as the protagonist, read on!**\n\nHello, all! I'm a 21+ male searching once again for an amazing partner. I have a deep love for the Warcraft universe and absolutely love to roleplay! However, neither the game nor the roleplaying community really sates my appetite lately. The game's current story development and the roleplaying community are both very stagnant and don't really offer the same passion that they used to.\n\nThat being said, here's a bit about me! As I said, I'm 21+. I'm recently engaged and I work a mundane desk job by day as well as train to compete in a weightlifting sport by night. I've been writing for about half of my life! I got into it when I was quite young (playing Runescape, no less) and found a passion for it early on. I would love to make a career out of it, honestly, but I'm far too busy to write alone. So, it should be no surprise that I like to roleplay!\n\nMy response frequency will be at least 5-10 posts *per day*. My posts will all have quite a bit of length and will never lack my total effort. As I said, I do work a desk job but fortunately, I have plenty of time to spit out responses on my laptop most days! Occasionally, however, I will be busy and write out a few paragraphs on my phone but I'm confident that my quality doesn't drop when I do that. That aside, I obviously write in the third person and from a narrator's perspective, due to me playing as a DM/GM.\n\nNow, what am I looking for in a partner? Well, someone who is:\n\n* Passionate about their writing. I'm not interested in helping someone just pass the time!\n* In love with the Warcraft universe! While I know few people who love Warcraft as much as I do, the roleplay would benefit from someone that really enjoys the lore. I don't really care if you know a whole lot about the lore but it'd be great if you enjoyed it as much as me!\n* Willing to post semi-frequently. As I said, my posts will be fairly common and will not lack quality. I would love to find someone who likes to send three or more paragraphs per response and do it as much as I do!\n* Capable of pushing emotion into their writing! My main peeve with /r/roleplay is that I encounter a lot of people who don't put any emotion into their writing, whether it's IC or OOC. I want to be excited to write with you and explore your character's thoughts! It really is a chore to build a world around a robot. Or write with a robot, for that matter!\n* Willing to be a friend. I really would prefer to have an actual friendship with my partner! I don't expect us to be great friends for life (I'm not opposed!), but writing with a stranger can be a bit dull at times!\n\nThis is getting a *bit* long, so I'll start to wrap it up! Here are my thoughts for a plot:\n\n* Humble Beginnings: 25 years after the great wars began, your character is called to action when foreign enemies attack your home. You will start with little and earn glory for your name, deity, or faction, and strive to become a legend of Azeroth. (Scenario: Start during the timeperiod of Vanilla WoW and adventure through various expansions up until the current year).\n* Legion: The Burning Legion has returned to Azeroth in Year 32. The combined might of the Alliance and the Horde fly to a strange continent known as the Broken Isles where the future will be determined. (Scenario based on the events during Legion.)\n* Class Scenario: Ever want to live out the story of a Paladin of the Silver Hand? Or perhaps a Mage of the Kirin Tor? Maybe even a rogue of the Uncrowned? (An entire story based around class fantasy of WoW!)\n* The Battle for Azeroth: Conclude the events of the Fourth War in the final Battle for Azeroth, between the Alliance and the Horde (and the unseen forces). This would ideally play out slower than the others and eventually lead up to the Shadowlands expansion!\n\n\nI don't believe that I'm forgetting anything! If you have any questions or are interested, please send me a message! Also, please introduce yourself a bit if you don't mind! I usually get a ton of responses and give priority to the people that put more effort into their message.",

Someone who is willing to have an active OOC-Chat with me and will tell me if something is going wrong with our play, who is eager in developing and driving a story forward with me.  \n\nI can offer you an open mind, my best try hard skills and always the will to develop our story. My interest depends on your ability to do the same, I want a fun play which is driving forward and developing over time! I love details and decent long (1 - 2 paragraphs) responses.  \nMy heart beats for Romanticism (the era) and adventure. Therefore I can offer you deep sinking plays with characters which will change with the experiences of our story.\n\n**The dirty facts:**  \n - I prefer to play with someone older than 18  \n - My timezone is CET and I'm from Germany. It would be great if you are active when I am.  \n - My preferred style is \"Rapid-Fire\"  \n - I love medieval / high or low fantasy but I'm also open to Sci-Fi  \n - I'll only play with a female partner (me being male).  \n\nYou are interested in getting in touch with me?

            "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nAs you can probably guess from the title, I'm looking for a Star Wars RP today! I had this idea a few days ago, and honestly I barely have it fleshed out, I was hoping to come up with ideas for it together!\n\nThe general idea is for a young lad living alone, in front of an old abandoned Jedi Temple. He likes to maintain the old books and read in the library, and is mostly content living like this in solitude.\n\nI like the idea of a Jedi master finding him, and realising he has quite the potential in the Force. Could be a vision, could be the rumour mill, could be a chance meeting after originally just looking for the old temple and library.\n\nYou don't even have to RP a Jedi! Could be a random bounty hunter or pilot or whatever sent to fetch him, or who maybe crash landed there.\n\nI'm pretty flexible with time period also, he fits basically anywhere from the Old Republic pre-Revan, all the way to well after the sequel trilogy!\n\nI'm open to different canons, like for example Ahsoka, Shaak Ti, or Rey, but you are of course free to create your own OC also!\n\nI'll stop the rambling for now, if you're interested please PM me with your Discord handle so I can add you there!\n\nSee you soon!\n\n***\n\nMax was almost excited! He had never gotten visitors before, although he was definitely apprehensive about it too. Very few people knew where he was and what he was doing here, and besides he never ever got in anyone's way. Now he did have some contact with the outside world, although it was extremely limited. Just every few months he would visit his friends, who graciously let him stock up on supplies, and give them figurines he liked to carve out of wood. he still doubted that he was even significant enough to make a lasting impression on them though, considering how sporadic the whole thing was.\n\nOnce the ship entered atmospheric flight, it was greeted by a view of just green everywhere, interspaced by oceans and great rivers and lakes. There seemed to be a small settlement right at the specified coordinates, although that might even be an understatement. There was a medium sized building, seemed like an old temple, and a very much lived-in courtyard. A small and very old-looking shuttle, the main hatch open with a large canopy in front. A campfire, with a metal pot suspended over it, a line with clothes hanging up to dry, a few pillows for sitting.\n\nThere was but one person awaiting the ship, a young woman dressed in simple grey and beige robes, and was holding a hardwood staff in both hands. Max was rather cautious, clutching onto his staff, but decided to stand his ground for the time being. \"Who are you?\" he asked, trying to mask the shakiness of his voice, as he called out into the open hatch of the ship.",

That secret was known only to the uppermost Lords of Hell, and the deeper circles. But when demons from said lower circles begin fleeing upward, seeking refuge and speaking of a being of pure hatred intent on their wholesale annihilation of the denizens of all nine circles, surely it'd be a point of concern for Charlie and the staff of the Hotel.*\n\n*How would they deal with this new, mysterious figure who was not of Hell, yet seemed to be highly feared by the lower circles?*\n\n\n Heyo! That little diddy there is just a quick writing prompt I put together for a 1x1 roleplay I thought up, inspired by [this edit](https://youtu.be/iRFiOeiB2Mg) and [this video](https://youtu.be/dBVyaOHZBHU). It's not really meant to be serious, of course, given the setting. So, with that said, here's the rules;\n\n- At least 18 years of age. Considering the humor in Hazbin Hotel, and the graphic violence of Doom, this shouldn't be confusing.\n\n- Literate writing. At least 2+ paragraph responses. I don't expect a thesaurus from my partners.\n\n- Experience playing canon characters from HH (mainly Charlie, Vaggie, etc.), whilst I play the Slayer and other characters required to advance the plot.\n\n- Let's keep it casual! I like to chat, crack jokes, and whatnot, so let's go along like this. Besides, we're both here to have fun!\n\n\nWell, those are the rules! Fairly simple to follow, so feel free to message me or leave a comment to discuss plot details either here or on Discord. \n\nTil' then, everyone.",

Found in every home, bought and sold in every marketplace, for most, magic is merely a tool, a mundane part of everyday life. For some, however, magic is an art, and they have devoted their lives to its practice. These are the mages. Banded together into magical guilds they apply their skills in search of fame and fortune. Many such guilds dot the landscape of Fiore. Young Hopeful wizards line up across the country to join these guilds... And for the citizens, this is a happy sight... but there are dark forces at play... a long forgotten kingdom come to rise again. Will the wizards of Fiore be able to find these ancient people? And what choice will they make to their fate?\n\nIt has been revealed to the world that the very Golems who spent their immortal lives serving the powerful dragons were trapped underground by the very humans they tried to help... now they seek revenge on the world... and the Dark Guilds remaining in Fiore are more than happy to help them get that revenge... through whatever means necessary.  \n\\------------------------------------------------------------------  \nBut what can we offer to you?

His hair is disheveled, he probably hasn\u2019t shaved in days, and it looks like he\u2019s wearing two different yet somehow really similar pairs of shoes. It makes Shannon\u2019s heart thump against his ribs, a yearning to get to know this interesting man. He\u2019s never noticed his watchful eye, not once in the dozens of times he\u2019s rushed passed the studio\u2019s windows. Shannon likes it this way, though; he\u2019s never had, nor does he think he will ever have, the confidence to speak to him. Just being able to quietly observe him, as he lives his everyday life, is enough for him. Even if those moments last but measly minutes, sometimes with week long gaps in between. It feels like a gift that he doesn\u2019t quite deserve.",

I have a few difference characters in mind that I'd like to use, depending on the character my partner comes up with. I like the idea of a larger city ( Washington D.C., Dallas, Boston, NYC) and coming together as coworkers or neighbors, I have a few different ideas depending on characters. \n\nI exclusively roleplay on discord and in third person. I really want to keep everything modern, and realistic, no fantasy or sci-fi aspects. As far as drama, angst, and different road bumps I'm very open to things that can happen. I'm hoping this will be a longer term type of thing, and I am willing to navigate NSFW elements.\n\nSend me a PM and we can chat more and hopefully move over to Discord, hope to hear from you soon!",

            "selftext": "Hello, you can call me Doe! I'm in my 20s, a student, and a proud cat mom. I write multiple paragraphs/novella style (200-500+ words). I love to write detailed descriptions and delve into a character\u2019s head/emotions as well as surroundings. I compare it to writing a novel together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand if the scene doesn\u2019t have alot going on and therefore requires less like rapid fire. I adore having long, thoughtful replies where we truly immerse ourselves in the world. I'm hoping to find a partner whose as enthusiastic and passionate about the plot and writing as I am. When I get invested in a story, it\u2019s 100% dedication. Getting a reply is the highlight of my day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a big fan of romance and using face claims. I\u2019m the type to make pinterest boards, spam you with gifs, headcanons, and send you songs that remind me of our characters and/or ship. I'll get excited if we come up with a great plot idea or if our characters are being cute or going to get into trouble. I live for this kind of stuff honestly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast but not least I only do MxF (with myself in the female role) and don\u2019t double, but I\u2019m more than happy to write side characters of either gender to help move the story along. I'd highly prefer female authors writing male characters. Male authors, please stop contacting me. I've been burned too many times. If you persist, I'll ignore your message. Sorry!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDesperately Searching For\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- 21+ partners\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- For you to have an excellent grasp of grammar, punctuation, spelling, and capitalization. Both in character and out of character. (Literate to advanced writers only, please. I'm not looking for newbies).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- The more description, the better! I'm looking for someone can write as much as me (2 to 4 paragraphs or more) and really bring the story to life. I lose interest if I'm the only one that's invested/enthusiastic or coming up with plot ideas. Quality writing makes my heart happy, as does world building together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- The use of real life face claims and joining me in the wonderful world of ship/character development isn't a requirement but I'd sure be delighted if we were on the same page in this regard. (I won't use anime faces, only realistic art if you're uncomfortable with real life)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Someone who won't leave without warning or explanation after sending the first post. I'm looking for the long term here, and I have been greatly saddened by how many partners have left me high and dry recently.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you've made it this far, thank you! You won't be disappointed in writing with me. I tend to be online daily and I'd like it if you were too. Please let me know if you're going to be inactive, long days/weeks of silence make me nervous.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOriginal Genres:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Mafia/Crime\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Post Apocalyptic/Dystopia\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Supernatural/Modern Fantasy\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Southern/Mid-Western/Urban Gothic\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Modern Mythology/Fairytale Retellings\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Sci-fi\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Superpowers/Gifted\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll my characters will be adults and I require my partners to do the same, as there will be adult themes in my writing. ***For more plot and more genre ideas, message me*** \\^\\^ I prefer to write over email but can use discord for chatting and writing, along with google docs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease be detailed when you message me, let me know why you chose to contact me. Seeing only \"hey do you wanna rp?\" is a guaranteed way to turn me off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLook forward to hearing from you!",

Professors/teachers didn't really get to do all of those things anymore. \n\nBut when one professor meets his more out of control student he falls in love and that student is more than happy to show how he lives. But this means that the professor neglects his teaching duties and his life practically falls apart. \n\nHiya I know this isn't the best thought out idea you've ever seen but I got hit with the hammer of inspiration. This plot will have very infrequent chunks of nsfw, so I want/require my partner to be over 18. This will also have heavier themes like drugs, alcohol, cheating and overall drama. Also, it takes place in the 70s so please no modern tech obviously. This is specifically designed to be mxm but irl gender isn't important.

I have been RPing for 17 years now (Since the time of the Yahoo Instant Messenger RPs!...before they got rid of the user rooms).\u00a0\n\nI have been searching for someone who can Roleplay as Vegeta from Dragonball Z. But heres the catch. I use an Original Character...but fear not! I don't make Mary Sue characters and I have been working on a full bio for my OC that I use just for the Dragonball franchise. It would be post Frieza Saga and go off in an Alternate Universe (no Trunks and the androids will probably come but it'll end up different) and it WILL be a romance! With action and adventure. Fights will be slightly included but if it gets too long we can time skip and try to figure out who is the winner between the characters.. Any more questions about this don't be afraid to ask me!\n\nNow, Rules... I am pretty lienient when it comes to Roleplays. Some literacy is a MUST. Of course we all make grammar mistakes (I know I make quite a bit as I look at myself typing this out lol). I do Semi paragraph to multi paragraph replies and starting posts as well full of detail. I would hope and wish that someone out there would be willing to do the same. also, this is in 3rd person. This will be romance like I have stated..but if you need to do a time skip through the lovey dovey bits please dont hesitate to tell me and we can time skip. Also...please DO NOT GOD MOD. its annoying.. Also...PLEASE BE ACTIVE. I know real life gets in the way and I'm understanding of that (trust me I work 40 hours a week I understand lol) I LOVE fast repliers they make me really happy trust me. If you get uninterested please just let me know I wont be mad I promise. also..PLOTTING. I love to plot out an idea that you might have or I might have before installing it into the RP. also about my OC I can tell you alot more about her if you are interested and I can even supply artwork of her as well.\n\nWell that seems to be the lot of it! I think I remembered everything...I hope I remembered everything lol. But please if you are interested hit me up with a PM or comment here and please don't be shy to ask me questions! I am always happy to answer any questions regarding everything I'm looking for. I hope I hear from someone!! Thanks!",

Before I get into any explanations/rules, I'd like to make it clear that I'm on mobile (which I hate) so this post is probably going to be short and may have errors. That's just the mobile life, yo.\n\nAlright, so this is a decently wild idea in terms of rp. Darth Vader, the character I'll be using, is an iconic character for sure. He is going to become a part of any universe/Fandom of your choosing--with a few exceptions. I'll also list some rules as well here:\n\n1. I love combat, so we're not going to throw him into the marvel/DC universe where he has little to no chance of beating those top tier characters like superman, thanos, Galactus and so on. I welcome a challenge, but nothing that's impossible. Basically, no universes where there are galaxy busters and stuff. \n\n2. Original universes are also welcomed, although I'd prefer to use established universes to see how Vader can hold his own in those universes (Harry Potter and so on).\n\n3. Not everything is combat focused, of course. This rp is also about Vader coming to terms with his new reality and reflecting on his past back home in his universe. So yes, that means romance is a possibility.\n\n4. For my Star Wars fans--I don't claim to know everything about star wars, the force or even Vader. I'll try to be as accurate as possible, but SW is very much a new addiction for me even though I've had years to truly love it, but didn't. That being said, I won't stick entirely to the rules of the force. Thinking of it like a video game, I may give Vader new force powers as he grows stronger (perhaps the ability to use force lightning, although I'm not sure how to go about that since he kind of can't).\n\n\nOkay. Now for what I want in a partner:\n\n1. 18+ in age please! There will be dark themes.\n\n2. Literacy.\n\n3. Two minimum paragraphs per post. Seriously, anything less than that without a decent excuse or reasoning probably means I'll ignore you, depending on how far we are in the rp or as partners. \n\n4. Decent response rate. I'm busier these days so like most people there will be times I can't response or take a while to respond. One response a day is fine with me, if we go beyond that then awesome!\n\n5. Friendly! I love chatting OOC as well.\n\nI think that's everything! Please DM me if you're interested and we can iron everything else out from there. I'm excited to hear from you all!",

            "selftext": " Hey.\n\nBefore I start, I have a few rules that I will go over quickly. Be literate! Have proper grammar, punctuation, and boast several paragraphs at once. As long as you can adapt to the length of my posts, I am more than okay with us RPing. Please, no ghosting. If you don't like the RP or where it's heading, message me. OOC chat is more than welcome, and it's good for discussing the direction of the story. KEEP IN MIND THIS IS ONLY FOR THOSE WHO ARE 18+ (as there may be NSFW material involved). You can be 17, but in no circumstances will I RP anything NSFW.\n\nNow, onto the main part of this post... My idea!\n\nSo, I have asked to RP in the Walking Dead universe. I would be more than happy for each of us to play cannons (main characters) / OC. If you choose to play an OC, it\u2019s only fair to also RP a cannon character. I will be doing that myself. I also like doubling, so I want us to try that when appropriate. Plus, I play secondary cannon characters when needed, and I expect the same in return :)). \n\nAs for the knowledge of The Walking Dead, I say maybe you have seen at least 4-5 seasons (more preferable 7-8, but I don't mind, really). I would like to start at the beginning, maybe season 2ish, but I\u2018d like for you to have some knowledge as to what happens next. I\u2019d like to follow the show roughly.\n\nI'm looking for someone who can RP **Daryl** really well, and I of course wouldn't mind RPing the cannon of your choice!\n\nIf you have any further queries or would like to RP, shoot me a message and I\u2019ll be more than glad to answer. I roleplay exclusively on Discord.\n\nSee ya!",

            "selftext": "Hi,\n\nI want to play a story where a girl stays over at a guy\u2019s place and she is treated like a princess in return for nothing.\n\nThe idea is based around the concept of couchsurfing. If you are not familiar with the website of the same name, it is a sort of social network where people offer each other a couch to sleep. Besides being for free, its point is about cultural exchange and getting in contact with locals instead of being isolated in the typical tourist bubble. It has a system of verification and mutual reviews that (used wisely, which not everybody knows how to do) helps one avoid the bad experiences (creepy hosts, crazy guests, etc). Surfers tend to be backpackers and students who cannot afford a hotel. Most hosts offer a couch in the living room, but a tiny minority may offer a proper bed and a separate room.\n\nWhat I would like to play is a 30 year-old guy, David, who lives alone, is relatively intelligent and has a stable job (researcher at a university). So he is doing well in some terms but is rather shy and doesn\u2019t have a lot of friends. One day he decides to set up a profile as a couchsurfing host, hoping to meet new people. As recommended, he describes himself, his place, posts pictures, etc. He fills everything, gets verified, and makes all look trustworthy.\n\nYou could play a young woman who is also new to couchsurfing. She may be a student and she cannot afford traveling the typical way, but she found a very cheap ticket and she heard that in couchsurfing one can get accommodation for free, so she has been looking at it. Most guys in the city look too creepy or are busy, and my character is the only one free. So she writes to him on the couchsurfing app indicating the days she will be there and he readily accepts her request.\n\nI am interested in playing in detail her arrival and stay and a sort of dynamics between them where she is quite demanding and spoiled. At the same time, his personality will make him do his best to accommodate her demands and keep her happy. He will not expect anything in return; he will do it because he feels it is his duty to be a gentleman and because he will cherish the feeling of making a girl happy. He may also develop feelings towards her which will make his desire to please her stronger, but he will not expect anything in return. I am open regarding how much stuff she \u201cdemands\u201d and how much he \u201coffers\u201d and she just gladly takes, or it can be a mixture. But in any case, this kind of imbalance between them is core for the story and you should really enjoy playing that kind of girl if you play this. Just some examples: she may expect him to pick her up at the airport, he will prepare breakfast and food for her, he may show her the city around if she wishes, he will give her preference using any appliance in his home, he will keep things clean and he will give up his bed to her and he will sleep on the sofa instead.\n\nRegarding her feelings, I am open to a range between she just enjoying everything without remorse to feeling some remorse but still enjoying all the free services. I am not interested in a story where she eventually \u201cbecomes good\u201d and does stuff for him, as for me it is very central that she retains the princess role. I am open to long-term romance as long as she keeps that role.\n\nI would like him to be European and live in Europe. She can be from anywhere.\n\nIf you are not interested in the idea of the couchsurfing platform, there is an alternative version where she is stranded in the city after her purse was stolen, without passport or money or access to a hotel, and coincidentally he runs into her, and he offers her help letting her stay at his place with all the amenities mentioned above.\n\nYou can choose the rest of the characteristics of your character and tell me if you have preferences regarding details about my character or whether you would like to change anything.\u00a0\n\nIf you are interested in this roleplay, please read also the pinned post in my profile, which describes general details of how I roleplay. Then you can send me a PM.",

Preferably it would be multi-paragraph, as I can reach 6+ paragraphs or drop down to 2-3 if things have slowed down. Decent use of punctuation, grammar and capitalization would be great, too.\n\nNow that the boring stuff is outta the way, I'd love a Star Wars roleplay right now. I have a Mandalorian bounty hunter OC that I've taken inspiration from the show and a handful of classic Western films. Open to any era, any character, too. I don't have a concrete plot in mind, but I'm sure we can figure that out. \n\nOn top of that, I've been recently getting back into Bruce Wayne/Batman as I've been replaying the games, watching the films and reading a lot of the comics. I'd love to play Bruce Wayne in a roleplay against another canon, or an OC. Though I prefer canon characters, I'm more than willing to make an exception to that rule. \n\nAside from the Star Wars and DC stuff;\n\nI also enjoy many many other fandoms such as Marvel (more specifically Spider-Man) and can play Peter Parker, Miles Morales, Luke Cage (preferred) Danny Rand, Matthew Murdock, Frank Castle, T'Challa, Thor Odinson and Steve Rogers. For the Marvel universe roleplays I'd love a canon ship but I'm open to OCs! \n\nThe other video games I enjoy are...\n\nGod of War\n\nRed Dead Redemption\n\nOverwatch\n\nHalo\n\nThe Elder Scrolls\n\nSplinter Cell\n\nDestiny\n\nBorderlands\n\nFar Cry\n\nThe Last of Us\n\nDevil May Cry and many more! Feel free to ask! \n\nAs my post said, I would prefer these to be done over Discord so DM me for my Discord tag and we can get to chatting!",

I'm pretty good about posting every day, but sometimes things come up. I'm very flexible with the amount/length of posts.\n\nJust a side note, I'm in CST time and this is not my usual schedule (insomnia..) I do sometimes stay up late, but I'm unfortunately up early as well!\n\n**Specifications:**\n\n\\- *Please be literate.* I tend to write long novel style posts with a lot of descriptions. 1 paragraph minimum, but don't force to write a ton for the sake of words. I'm okay with rapid fire/casual rps! Just still at least 1 paragraph. 3rd person only! \n\n\\- *Frequency.* I work all day for about 10+ hours online. I'm not always looking on Discord as this is just a hobby for me. If something comes up, I will let you know - I just expect the same! I also am a full time college student doing a double major, sometimes things might get hectic!\n\n\\- *Discord.* I only use Discord to rp, I will not use anything else as I do not check it as often\n\n\\- *18+ only.* This includes any OCs! Nothing personal, and I know you can lie about it\n\n**Genres I am willing to RP:**\n\n\\- *Star Wars:* Any era/situation is welcome! My OC is a Grey Jedi/Master whose background can be changed to fit the plot\n\n\\- *Law Enforcement:* Can be criminal x criminal or criminal x officer. My OC is already in the crime underground\n\n\\- *Slice of Life:* I'm super open to this, just let me know what kind interests you!\n\n\\- *Others:* Have another idea? Let me know! I'm really flexible with plots! I'm not exactly into fantasy\n\nI'd like all of these to include romance! This would be developed and woven in, not forced.\n\nThings are a bit complicated for me right now, so I apologize in advance!\n\n\nThanks for your time! &lt;3",

            "selftext": "Hello All.  \n  \nI'm currently looking to set up a My Hero Academia x Dragon Ball Z Crossover rp. Sounds a bit weird I know but given they're both Shonen's and have similarities I think it's something that would pan out in a really interesting way. Essentially a DBZ character (Whom I would play) would end up trapped in the MHA setting. I'm looking for someone to play a member of Class 1-A to play off of. Themes would match MHA, comedy, drama, action etc.  \n  \nThe RP aims to explore the fun nature of the characters involved and the situations they could get mixed up in. However this would be platonic and I'm not really looking to do pairings for this rp (this also means no smut). It's more a master student kind of situation as well as just exploring and enjoying the world that MHA inhabits.   \n  \nI'm looking for people mostly familiar with MHA, DBZ familiarity isn't required. I see at least multi para rp'ing with a good eye for detail and world building. I'm happy to GM most of the rp but any suggestions and ideas I'm happy to receive as I want it to be a collaborative experience. I'm looking for multi para rp'ers with a mind for detail ideally. This idea is a bit of a passion project for me, a long running story that would run through different arcs, covering a wide range of scenarios, scenes and story lines.    \n  \nIf this kind of adventure in the fun setting of MHA appeals to you then please don't hesitate to DM me. Thanks!",

I have a few very different ones that have been abandoned that I'd really love to continue, and I saw a post a while back about someone offering to continue RPs like that, so I figured I'd put it out there!\n\nPlease feel free to ask any questions you'd like about the RPs, or to just hear about which ones I'd like to continue.

I would like them to get involved in the cult of Silent Hill by accident or by your character's actions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow that I am done explaining, I have a few standards I am looking for in a partner.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Must be over the age of 18+**\n* **Multi-Para, but quality over quantity.**\n* **Must be communicative (I enjoy being friends with people I roleplay with)**\n* **Looking for an active poster.

            "selftext": "Hello, people of Reddit! You can call me Deco, and I'm here to take you through this wonderful roleplaying ad! Que the music!\n\nWhat...no music? Fine, I suppose I shall proceed with this as normal. I'm a multi-paragraph writer who prides herself in her character making, world building, and art! Well, not as much art as the other two, but you get the idea. I'm here today to gather a few 1x1 roleplays for Discord! Apologies if you're on anything else. I'm in the PST time zone, so please be at least somewhat close to that. I write specifically in third person and prefer you do, too!\n\nSomething to know about me is that I'm really quick with replying - I'm a really fast type and as such my replies usually take 5-15 minutes (if I'm not currently busy) and are usually 2-5 paragraphs in the beginning and 1-3 when the excitement simmers down. I don't like putting filler and such in my replies, they're usually straight to the point...well, with character thoughts and feeling added. \n\n I also love OOC talk and hypotheticals about our characters! I love that 'Imagine our characters ran a flower shop together, they'd call it (insert funny ship name) and one of them would somehow burn it to the ground'. I also prefer romance in my plot - and I do like to draw! I highly prefer drawn references over real ones. I don't really do real face pics for my characters, I find them...offputting, I suppose.\n\nNow, onto what I'm looking for! I have been hoping to do something Dark Souls themed. If you play Solaire I will DIE for you, literally. Lautrec x Anastacia would be quite fun, though, too...or putting Dark Souls characters into the modern world. Eep. I fangirl too much.\n\nIf you don't know Dark Souls, fear not! I have plenty of other things I like, like cowboys! And fantasy! I've got a character I'd like to try out - basically a shape shifter who with every form has a different personality (she has a select few forms).\n\nI would like to do something Beauty and the Beast themed. I had an idea for something related to that - basically the best is a vampire that's thousands of years old due to a curse and requires love to break ot, of course. Though he's very unwilling to do so, mostly because it was his past love that cursed him. If you don't wanna play the beast, though, I wouldn't mind playing a cursed lady!\n\nI've also wanted to do something military themed (despite my knowledge of the military). Maybe something between a ruthless cop and a protesting firefighter that happen to be roommates. They hate each other, andmare forced tomhate each other because of the current events in France.\n\nIf any of this seems interesting (especially if you want a Dark Souls plot), PM me with a bit about yourself and what you'd like to do as far as writing with me goes!",

This is a shot in the dark in regards to the intensity of this role, but I'm thinking many people would like to try! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am seeking a partner to play a sociopathic/psychopathic (perhaps serial killer?) antagonist against my female OC in our own psychological horror/thriller romance. I will play the role of an innocent woman (my OC) that your character finds himself unrealistically attached to after just one casual exchange. This attachment may be due to your character having some form of disorder or previous behavior of such. Having said this, I ask that my partner have correct knowledge of the mental disorder they do choose to portray with their character. The characters' meeting can be anywhere at any time depending on our ideas. Your character will eventually form an unhealthy infatuation for my OC. This infatuation will drive him to obsessive behavior, and he'll stop at nothing to hear her say \\*'I love you'\\*. We can discuss the terms of these lengthy efforts once we've exchanged contact info. I would absolutely love to see how our characters would piece together in the grimy streets of some sort of urban setting. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI play in 3rd person. My writing ranges from semi-lit to novella depending on how much I am inspired. That being said, I will always try to never fail to deliver. I prefer to have long-term partners, and I absolutely love getting to know them OOC. I play on Discord only.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease PM me if you're interested in playing this role!

            "selftext": "Hi and greetings to all reading this post! I'm currently looking for anyone interested in roleplaying in the Goblin Slayer universe. I'm a long time roleplayer myself, with a good 7-8 years of experience under my belt, and although I tend to both roleplay and write about different genres and types of stories, I've recently been keen to try and dabble in a more fantasy-medieval setting, and so I've thought of doing a story within GS' world as it's pretty straightforward and isn't too heavily stingy with its lore, so I think it offers a good basis to build a story on, whilst still offering a gritty setting.\n\nI'm fine with people using characters from the show, however I'm also entirely open to and would encourage OCs to be involved in the story ( in fact, that's what I myself would like to do), ans would follow a similar archetype of narrative as in the show itself. So you really needn't be 100% up to date with the series, even just sort of a general idea of what the show is about is good enough for me.\n\nSo, if at all this premise seems interesting to you, please reach out to me and I hope we can set something up!",

            "selftext": " **What I seek:**\n\nHey guys! I am an experienced writer accustomed to focusing only on manly men romance. **I would like to learn how to broaden my horizons and use same skill with a straight couple.** My characters will still remain males and manly, but I'd like to discover some sort of enjoyment in portraying them in a MxF romance!  \n\n\nThis might sound silly for some of you, especially those used to swapping between various types of main pairings. But it is an actual issue for me, as a writer. So what I hope for, is to be presented with a multidimensional, well developed, flawful yet somewhat internally strong, female personality. To try and write against them in a setting of our choosing. I would like to preestablish the type of scenario that will really show what our characters are made of. Hopefully then, I will be able to find fulfilment in writing against a female main.  \n\n\n**What I offer:**  \n\n\n* Realistic, imperfect, masculine, male characters as mains  \n^((plus various types of people as sides/NPCs))\n* High quality posts  \n^((with length adjusted to the fashion we choose to write in))\n* Leaning towards character development in the background of an exciting plot  \n^((in whatever setting and genre we feel like exploring!))\n* Friendly and frequent OOC communication  \n^((I'm ghost/ditch friendly but personally I keep partners in the loop))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What I can't promise:**  \n\n\n* Keeping swift momentum with the story  \n^((I'm unable to post regularly when I'm struggling to hold my interest and...this might be the case due to the very essence of the rp I seek rn))\n* Not losing interest after plotting, few posts or in the middle of the rp  \n^((though if we click, I don\u2019t mind trying different characters and stories!))\n* Being available right away  \n^((I'd like us to stay in touch but I might not have time to start our story until at a later date))\n* Accepting any female character  \n^((I might be picky on purpose, to be able to assure that once we give it a go, I can at least try to stay invested))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What I require from you:**  \n\n\n* Please be an experienced, detailed writer  \n^((please be willing to exchange some samples!))\n* Share your ideas  \n^((don't be afraid to incorporate them into the story/take lead whenever it feels natural))\n* Stable OOC communication  \n^((we can send IC posts as often or as rarely as we decide, but please be available to plot/chat about our characters, or otherwise I might lose interest faster))\n* Maybe most importantly for this particular rp, please be patient with me and don't get easily hurt!  \n^((by my temporary lack of inspiration or by me losing interest completely))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Let's treat this as some sort of literary experiment! My goal is to learn how to enjoy writing MxF pairings (maybe even one day with me trying to take the F role). So if you have a female character who you crave to play? Feel free to share her description in your first message to me. I'm excited to see if this works out!**",

Ko'atal speaks of justice, truth, and peace for all, an outworld where people need not fear. One that may be at peace with earth realm. However when the time came to accept the throne they were ambushed by Shaos subordinates who also wished to claim the throne. Reiko, and Mileena were the 2 who seeked it. Aided by the Tarkatens, Centaurs and Black Dragon. They have a powerful army led by those such as Ermac, Scarlet, Reptile and Kano.\n\nSadly Reiko has taken the palace by storm. Ko'atal and his allies barely escaped with their lives. Thus starting the great civil war for outworld. Allied with Ko'atal is the Shokans, the civilians of outworld and the special forces. His closest confidants being that of Kitana, Rain, Raiden etc. \n\nOnce the throne was Taken it was discovered that the amulet of Onaga, a powerful artifact of outworlds past has been found in a nearly impossible fortress. Whoever claim it can bend reality to their whim. Unstoppable power for its weilder. This cannot fall into Reiko's hands. \n\nThere will be multiple chapters for this story! Different characters per chapter (just like in the games). Such as Ermac and Scarlet, Rain and Kitana etc. Many possibilities for this, so feel free to message me! Thanks!",

I am a literate player, and am expecting the same. I am not expecting perfect posts, but please have a hold of proper grammar and spelling. I won\u2019t call you out! \ud83d\ude0a\n\nPlease be 18 plus. I am not looking for roleplays that only surround smut, but I am smut friendly when it is part of a proper character arc, or an important part of relationship building for the plot. I prefer \\[fxm\\] pairings, but if it is an interesting character or plot, I would consider \\[fxf\\]\n\nI prefer to write in 3rd person, and I am looking for 2-3 paragraphs in each reply. I prefer to write over discord, so when you message me, please include your discord name. \ud83d\ude0a I play both female and male characters, but my main characters are women. However, I would be happy to double and play additional characters.\n\nI love to chat in ooc, so please don\u2019t feel as though you can\u2019t tell me about yourself. I do work full time, so I am on most often in the evenings. Please let me know if you would like to no longer continue our RP instead of disappearing. I worry! \n\nCurrently these are the fandoms I am craving:\n\nDragon Age (Origins, DA2, Inquisition, After trespasser)\n\nThe Witcher (Game and Show Knowledge)\n\nFinal Fantasy 7, or 8 \n\nFallout 4\n\nGeneral High Medieval Fantasy\n\nGeneral Werewolves / Supernatural\n\nDark Alice in Wonderland/ Dark Little Red Riding Hood\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo drop a line in my PM's and lets start creating stories together!",

You either help, hoping for joy or don't out of laziness, the result ending the same. He will walk away, and after, your character will suddenly undergo an instantaneous, magical transformation into a weak form (like a little kid or something), and assuming it was the guy who wanted aid, she'll decide to follow in an effort to change back.

I've been recently getting into roleplaying again after years of not doing it and I've been trying to write stories on Wattpad. Anyways I can throw maybe a few ideas out and list the fandoms I could do among other things. \n\nFandoms: Star Wars (with characters, OCs or mixed), Halo, Assassins Creed, Marvel, DC, Naruto, SAO. \n\nOrginal: Fantasy, Sci Fi super hero stuff, slice of life possibly. I'm usually bad at these things and usually these are like last on my list. Except slice of life. I feel like making your own universe is something that would be a group RP not just 2 people. \n\nAnyways I usually post in the 3rd person and like OOC chats as well! I try and match the person I roleplay with and I'm not like a god at writing. I try and respond right away but I also work nights and live in the Pacific Time Zone so its 8:40 pm by the time of this post. Hope to hear from someone soon!!!!",

I\u2019m craving to write and I need an active partner.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the basics: Name\u2019s Dee, age is over 21 and timezone is GMT+1\n\nYou can find me here: I only roleplay via email, but DM me with some info about you and your email/Discord tag. I do like to chat OOC on Discord\n\nIf you contacted me before and I bailed on you or you bailed on me, don\u2019t hesitate to contact me again. I\u2019m sorry that happened!\n\nFor more roleplaying details read bellow\n\n\nI\u2019m your girl if:\n\nYou\u2019re also a girl or identify as such (sorry, my dudes, but I had some unlucky experiences with male partners)\nYou\u2019re over 18\nYou write original roleplays\nYou can send multiple replies a day (I love me some rapidfire too). If it\u2019s more convenient for you, we can have days or times of day when we do rapid fire. Slow paced roleplays make me sad and leave me pinning.\nCan play multiple characters and like to have a large cast.\nYou can write at least a paragraph per reply\n\n\nWhat I\u2019m looking for:\n\nMxM main pair with MxF and FxF as possible pairs on the sides\nSupernatural themes\nTime travel?\nONLY vanilla smut (if we add smut at all. We could fade to black, if that is what you want)",
