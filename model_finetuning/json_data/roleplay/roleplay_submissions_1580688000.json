            "selftext": "*Life has been tough for Kiani Nichols. Her parents disowned her for being \"gay\" (she isn't, she's bi), she spent time in juvie for a crime she didn't commit, and now she's seventeen, in trouble with the law again... and pregnant. This time, a merciful judge has sent her to a camp for troubled teens run by Olympic equestrian Andrew Hellier at his stables an hour west of Baltimore, MD. There's just one catch: Kiani Nichols is terrified of horses.*  \n\n\nHello! I'm Shan, 25F, Australian. I have horses in real life and I will be playing both Kiani (main) and Andrew (as a supporting character). I am looking for a romance plot between two teens at the camp (or Kiani and a stablehand?), possibly enemies to lovers. NO SMUT. I'm a huge fan of cutesy fluff, and my favourite thing is hurt/comfort fluff where one character takes care of the other. This roleplay will have plenty of room for that, and in the end I'd love our characters to grow together, raise Kiani's baby, and potentially get married if that's what they both want.  \n\n\nI write a minimum of a paragraph, and when I'm on a roll, I'll write you half a novel. Please don't be discouraged or intimidated by longer replies - I care more about quality than quantity. My only limit is that you please put some effort into it and not give me one-liners. I'm after a 1x1 this time, which is a deviation from my usual, but so is this entire plot idea!  \n\n\nI am looking for someone who:  \n\\- is over 18 (personal preference plus this will deal with some heavy matters)  \n\\- is comfortable with *a lot* of cussing; I have a mouth like a sailor and so will Kiani  \n\\- will use a real life OR realistic art faceclaim (no anime please)  \n\\- won't just ghost me! if it's not working for you, tell me, don't just leave me hanging  \n\\- will reply at least once a week; that's not asking much!  \n\\- isn't afraid to bug me for replies if I get slow  \n\\- is comfortable using a discord server rather than DMs, because I like using channels to organise myself  \n\\- writes third person past tense  \n\n\nIt's a huge bonus if you:  \n\\- understand horses  \n\\- are familiar with showjumping or eventing in particular  \n\\- are familiar with PTSD/depression/anxiety",

I love to write detailed descriptions and delve into a character\u2019s head/emotions as well as surroundings. I compare it to writing a novel together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand if the scene doesn\u2019t have alot going on and therefore requires less like rapid fire. I adore having long, thoughtful replies where we truly immerse ourselves in the world. I'm hoping to find a partner whose as enthusiastic and passionate about the plot and writing as I am. When I get invested in a story, it\u2019s 100% dedication. Getting a reply is the highlight of my day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a big fan of romance and using face claims. I\u2019m the type to make pinterest boards, spam you with gifs, headcanons, and send you songs that remind me of our characters and/or ship. I'll get excited if we come up with a great plot idea or if our characters are being cute or going to get into trouble. I live for this kind of stuff honestly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast but not least I only do MxF (with myself in the female role) and don\u2019t double, but I\u2019m more than happy to write side characters of either gender to help move the story along. I'd highly prefer female authors writing male characters. Male authors, please stop contacting me. I've been burned too many times. If you persist, I'll ignore your message.

Both in character and out of character. (Literate to advanced writers only, please. I'm not looking for newbies).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- The more description, the better! I'm looking for someone can write as much as me (2 to 4 paragraphs or more) and really bring the story to life. I lose interest if I'm the only one that's invested/enthusiastic or coming up with plot ideas. Quality writing makes my heart happy, as does world building together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- The use of real life face claims and joining me in the wonderful world of ship/character development isn't a requirement but I'd sure be delighted if we were on the same page in this regard. (I won't use anime faces, only realistic art if you're uncomfortable with real life)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Someone who won't leave without warning or explanation after sending the first post. I'm looking for the long term here, and I have been greatly saddened by how many partners have left me high and dry recently.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you've made it this far, thank you! You won't be disappointed in writing with me. I tend to be online daily and I'd like it if you were too. Please let me know if you're going to be inactive, long days/weeks of silence make me nervous.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOriginal Genres:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Mafia/Crime\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Post Apocalyptic/Dystopia\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Supernatural/Modern Fantasy\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Southern/Mid-Western/Urban Gothic\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Modern Mythology/Fairytale Retellings\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Sci-fi\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Superpowers/Gifted\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll my characters will be adults and I require my partners to do the same, as there will be adult themes in my writing. ***For more plot and more genre ideas, message me*** \\^\\^ I prefer to write over email but can use discord for chatting and writing, along with google docs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease be detailed when you message me, let me know why you chose to contact me.

As the title suggests, Im currently on a bit of a Marvel  (both    MCU and Comics) crave and would love to find some people that  can    indulge in this together with me.\n\nAs for a little bit about myself, Im Munch. A 21 year old social   worker   from The Netherlands with about 10 years of writing experience.   Most  of  that has been in Dutch, and I still dont claim to be good.  But  I'm   literate at least. I average about 3/4 paragraphs per reply,   although I   can manage up to 8. I tend to match in case rp's go  shorter.  NSFW   elements aren't a problem at all in my opinion.\n\nI'm not looking for anything in particular, although I must say I prefer   writing Canon x Canon/OCxOC to Canon x OC. That doesn't mean I wont do  Canon  x   OC. I just had some bad experiences when it comes to writing   against   OCs, especially with the more popular characters. I write  both  M/F,\u00a0 M//   and F//, although I highly prefer the first. I can and   happily write   either gender.\n\nIf this sounds like a good deal to you, feel free to message me! I love meeting new people and would love to talk to you.\n\nCheers.",

I can also just be one guy but the premise would entail anything from you catching me with your daughter and either keeping quiet or joining us one night. You could also just hear me every night as I make her scream downstairs and one night you just give in and call me over for something only to get me to fuck you like you have been craving forever. We could also incorporate some blackmail and other forms of degradation and etc. Willing to go at this in multiple different ways. All I ask is that you have a reasonable amount of detail and good English. Looking forward to hearing back from someone I hope\n\nI am also open to hearing some prompts you might be interested in if this doesn't intrigue you\n\nI want someone who is actually interested in building some dialogue and etc before it just turns into smut. Please be capable and willing to make this intriguing.\n\nMy kik can be obtained from pming me\n\nI will be replying to all interested who are capable of replying in a timely fashion and capable of detailed responses.",

            "selftext": "Hello there! Here comes another hopeless romantic looking for to write yet another love story. Let me sum it up in bullet points to make it easier:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I am feeling in the mood for a **healthy romance**. Mainly **FxF**, but I will also consider any MxF or MxM proposals.\n* **Complementary genres are welcome** depending on the plot idea. I can do slice-of-life, fantasy, post-apocalypse, steampunk, adventure, drama, horror, thriller, psychological, what-you-have. Criminal and hard sci-fi are genres I find harder to write, but I won't say no to an attractive idea.\n* I accept anything from **SFW to NSFW** ('cause sex is as good topic as any and it doesn't need to grow stagnant with a proper execution). If an idea requires smut though, I will only allow **+18 or +21 RPers.** Also, my characters are people: sex playing a central role doesn't make it an excuse for neglecting other aspects of the roleplay.\n* Seeking **Discord-based** roleplay, with chance to adapt to **e-mail or Google Docs** for those who find that more comfortable.\n* **Length greatly varies** depending on partner,  moment and format. For example, Discord or conversational posts are prone to be shorter than Google Docs or descriptive paragraphs. My general range goes **from 50 to 800 words per reply**. Bear in mind though, **the more complex the post, the longer it will take me to answer.**\n* **Ditch-friendly as long as you warn me in advance.**\n\nIf you are interested and/or have any ideas that you'd like to play, don't be afraid to send me your PMs and I'll try to answer as swiftly as possible.",

Sounds like a weird concept, but I thought it\u2019d be interesting. \n\nWe can either make it a high school setting, a work setting, or college setting, I\u2019m open for anything else either. Maybe historical, but no fantasy please. \n\nThe idea I wanna work with is that you would play as the fatter girl (or I can, but I\u2019d prefer you did). You\u2019d be getting bullied and made fun of for your weight, leading to insecurities for you, and you just generally have very few/ no friends. Then we would meet, and I\u2019d be one of the only people to speak to you. We hit it off, and soon fall in love. \n\nMay sound cliche, may be offensive to some, but I hope someone likes the idea too.\n\nAs for smut, I\u2019d prefer to have that as only an occasional part of the roleplay. It won\u2019t be a main thing, and certainly won\u2019t be too regular of an occurrence. I\u2019d just prefer it to be more story and romantic based.\n\ncheck bio",

            "selftext": "Howdy All!\n\nI'm currently looking to set up a long term **MY HERO ACADEMIA** x Dragon Ball Z crossover rp. The long running idea requires another person to take the part of one of the member of Class 1-A (ideally Deku or Bakugo.) The synopsis is that a character from DBZ ends up stuck within the MHA setting and has to adapt and hide what they are to ensure they don't cause a panic, taking the guise of a hero (given the looks not a huge leap) - befriending the 1-A member and becoming something of a mentor as they go through various adventures. (**This idea is 100% SFW**)  \n  \nThemes would be most similar to MHA, Comedy, action, slice of life, drama and all those fun things. Set around the era of late s2-s3, the rp is set up to be quite a long term adventure and explore a lot of character interaction.\n  \nThe partner I'm ideally looking for:  \n- 18+ (part of the rules of this place anyway)  \n- Knowledge of MHA (DBZ knowledge is 100% not needed and could work more)  \n- At least 1 reply per week (though more would be nice)  \n- Multi para   \n- Third person  \n- Willing/ eager to contribute their own ideas to the story.  \n  \nSo that's about the long and short of it, there's a few more specific details I can give in private.   \n  \nI hope to find someone interested in this idea, if you're looking to explore the fun world of My Hero Academia with a fun little twist in a long term detailed RP, please don't hesitate to get in touch. I look forward to hearing from you!  \n  \nThanks!",

            "selftext": "Hello there!\n\nI'm a female who has experience playing both male and female characters within various settings. I have a soft spot for \"slice of life\" style role-plays, however, I truly enjoy sci-fi, fantasy, horror, mystery, and anything else that hops up on the table.\n\nI prefer to role-play on Discord and with people (18+) who have a somewhat decent handle on how the English language works. My role-play style tends to switch between 1st and 3rd person so whatever your preference is, I will endeavour to match it. Typically I prefer anything longer than 3 sentences and one-liners turn me off a role-play pretty quickly. I do understand that the creative well can run dry and with dialogue sometimes the role-play just needs to move faster.\n\nI have a flair for the dark/gritty/dramatic.\n\nI've got several ideas within the realms of reality, fantasy, and sci-fi, but I'm always up for anything new. If you'd like to role-play feel free to slip into my DM's or Message me what sort of role-play genre you enjoy and I can offer some ideas I have in that genre, or we can frankenmix a story ourselves.\n\nIn terms of activeness I live in GMT, I will always try to post at LEAST once a day, there are days when I can be extremely active, but other days it may be relatively quiet. I am currently working and studying, but the days I have off I spend role-playing, so I just ask for patience.",

I have a    lot of ideas and I can  make a character for just about  any  situation. If you think we'd be a  good fit  message   me even if  one  of   my  ideas didn't  grab you.\n\nOk  I  prefer MxF pairings. My characters are all very different so lets  talk about what we like. It'd be cool if we were friends.   Vent    to me,  share   pictures of your cat. Show me videos and songs   you  like.\n\nI   like to use   pictures  and plot things out. I love twists and drama. I      can play   side  characters too to build a larger world. OOC chat is    great!  Let's  be friends and if you have ideas too I'd love to hear    them.\n\n**SLICE OF LIFE**\n\n**I'M  IN LOVE WITH A STRIPPER:**   My guy finds himself at a strip club.     Whether   he's a regular or   it's his first time we can discuss. I have a  few  ideas  on who he   can be. Idea 1 shy guy who is smart but not so     good in  social    situations. Idea 2 gang type who likes to party but   is   super  loyal.    Idea 3 celebrity of some sort. We can discuss  ideas.\n\n**1984:**      The lead singer of a glam metal band is about to hit it big. Maybe      you're the girl who has been with him all along or maybe you're   someone    new. Lots of drugs and rock and roll. I want to follow him   through the    years. I'll be Gming the rest of the band and managers   etc.",

The smell noxious as the damp is unavoidable. \n\nGoulduan peers over the parapet walls of the castle and into the courtyard. \n\n*...it had been a long journey here. One that he couldn't have foreseen. Traveling with a brash guard name Filderin, the party had exchanged word with a clairvoyant. Filderin in his usual demeanor, \"carefully\" placed her to one-side. It wasn't long before the rain came, and more explicitly the moon came out. By the Glen of Afnan, near the bridge of the Afnan river, the view was obscured.* \n\n*The first highway man sprung out, as if mounted on some imaginary plinth; a statue coming to live. His breath deep, with an air of bite and a growl. A kind offer not place a sword in his back failed to subdue him. And like a well rehearsed dance we were the ones being coerced.  Like wild rabid dogs, the verges erupted into a frenzy of further men. What had started as an envoy mission had turned into the end of his days.* \n\n*On awaking, some time in the middle of the night, Goulduan lay beaten and broken. Almost certainly Filderin was dead, the pool of black blood seemed to sparkle in the moonlight. On instinct he ran, in the same way he was already heading. The deep gash on his arm, stinging like he'd been gored, seemed to heal within a few hours. Nothing more than a tingling....*\n\nGoulduan peers over the parapet walls of the castle and into the courtyard. His arm itches as he looks down, then looks to Luna in the sky perched happily gazing on the world below her. He could feel the hairs on his body standing on edge, like they were growing thicker by the second. His jaw locks as the canine teeth elongate, almost without thinking he tucks them into his bottom lip. His conscious mind knew what this all meant, but the urge to pounce over the wall and into the town had the biggest pull. He knew what he had to do, He had to find help. \n\n# Info\n\nI'm 30 male from England. I played D&amp;D for a while and wanted to try something different, more about the character interactions over rules. I'm looking for something more intimate, so one or two other people tops. I will probably operate as a sort of GM. I usually write in third person, but I'm okay writing in first person too if that's what the other(s) want. The theme if you haven't guessed is of Goulduan becoming a werewolf. It's my intentions to play him, but if anyone else wants to take that role I'm okay with that.\n\nI've wrote enough now, so if you're interested PM me with:  \nPreferred chat media (Discord/Hangouts/Reddit etc etc), Any ideas you might have, possibly a little intro from yourself, and about you as a person (as close as GMT as possible).",

            "selftext": "I literally couldn't think of a better title than that, I swear.\n\n\nThat aside, Hello! I'm back, today looking for less of a prompt, and more of a...general search? I have no idea. Before I get into the nitty gritty, allow me to say a bit about myself. I'm a 20-something male with plenty of writing experience, about 6ish years or so. I'm the kind of guy who (proudly) sprouts absurd and out there ideas, literally just on a whim or the slightest bit of inspiration. Seriously. Sometimes I can get a little crazy. My post length is anywhere between 1-3 paragraphs, but I came definitely get more out if I'm feeling inspired.  I'm also, for whom it might concern, in the central timezone of the United States. That being said, I have a horrid sleep schedule, so I'll usually be up pretty late into the night.\n\n\nWith that out of the way, let me say what I'm looking for. I am (unsurprisingly) looking for a female partner to nerd out with, 18+ of course, just in case we *do* go down a NSFW road at some point (It's welcome, but I'd like to not to be the focus of anything). **I will not, under any circumstances, write with someone under the age of 18**. I'm not comfortable with it, and I'm sorry if someone out there disagrees with this. Additionally, I'm looking for someone that I can call my friend. All proper and business is boring. I like to freak out with my writing partners. Come up with dumb plotlines or AUs. If you're looking for something strictly professional, I'm probably not your guy.\n\n\n\nFinally, we get down to what I'm *really* gonna be vague on. As you might've guessed by the title, I'm looking for something fantasy related. What specifically, you might ask? I have no clue. I'm a sucker for romance plots, with an epic adventure hanging above our characters' head. Be it slaying gods, or sealing away an ancient evil, I can't get enough of it. I love all sorts of different fantasy races, too. Elves? Oh yeah. Demons? Sure! Any kind of Yokai? *my god, that'll press my buttons in juuust the right way*. That being said, anyone that brings an idea with **Kitsune** as a major emphasis will make me *very* happy. Drow/Dark elves, too, though I'm not looking for the clich\u00e9 type of character for that.  Lolth worshippers be warned. Also, I'm huge fan of both the GARO series (both the animation and live action), and Kamen rider, if anyone has knowledge about those. Anyway. If you have any existing ideas, please, throw them at me! I love reading through plots n ideas. Want to create something new? We can chat for a bit, and see what we both like.\n\n\nI'm rambling now, aren't I? I think I've gone on for long enough. If I've caught your eye, please, shoot me a message, and I'll get to you ASAP. I get a lot of messages, so I'm sorry if I don't get to you right away. Some messages also slip through the cracks, or don't follow a certain obvious rule, so sorry on that regard as well. Just be sure to include your favorite color in your title, so I know you got down this far. I won't respond without it, because I don't enjoy it when people don't read my post. Like I said, I'm usually around into the late hours of the night, so you'll likely catch me. Thanks for reading!\n\n\n(Oh, by the way, don't send me a message only saying \"hey I think we can work something out\" or the like. Tell me about yourself, have some energy. Those kind of intros give me life)\n\nPlease don't send me a Reddit chat request.",

            "selftext": "Greetings to all reading this post! I'm looking for a partner that would be willing to play as Violet, in a story I'd like to write out.  \n\n\nTo clarify right at the start, this is **not** a fandom roleplay I'm looking to write! It's an original story, but with the same sort of notes and emotions the show itself strides to hit. So if you're looking for more canonical pairings, unfortunately I can't help you with that.  \n\n\nThe story itself will deal with loss, pain, recovery, and with romance eventually forming steadily as the story progresses. It will follow a similar premise with Violet's character, and would focus around her encounter with a soldier, who has lost everything, after returning home from a closing war. The setting itself will be the same as in the show, so early 1920s.  \n\n\nDue to the nature of the story and themes involved, I'm asking for my partner to be literate, and 18+ years of age, as it will deal with obviously adult theme and some heavy scenery.  \n\n\nAlongside that, I'm looking forward to chatting outside of roleplay itself, and forming a friendship with the person I'm writing with! I'm able to give posts on a daily basis, with some variations on exact timing, due to real life obligations and the sort. Equally I'm not too staunch on time between replies, so long as in each reply the story can progress further.  \n\n\nIf you're at all interested in this, feel free to send me a PM, and once I have you added up on Discord, I'll share the details of the story I imagined with you. That's all I have to say in this post, and thank you for reading, to those who have!",

            "selftext": "Disclaimer: I'm not actually as narcissistic as the title makes me sound xP\n\nHeyyo! I'm your friendly neighborhood Rp Boi. I'm twenty, lonely, and looking for friends to rp with. I've had a semester of English Major experience before my crappy semester of Computer Science took my college funding. Now I work at a call center. Basically what I'm saying is I'm writing Jesus. In all seriousness, I've been rping since I was thirteen and I have a little skill. At least I'd like to think so. I'm most likely around the lower end of literate. Nowhere near advanced lit. If you beg to differ, feel free to tell me rather than be rude. I'm always open to constructive criticism, but I haven't really had enough experience with the rp community at large to know one-hundred percent. If you decide you have to dog me about post length please, respectfully, save your time. I've been trying to go longer for a while now.\n\nAll in all I'd like to rp with someone who's willing to make a long term friend. I love fantasy. Sci-Fantasy, High Fantasy, Modern Fantasy? Love it all. I honestly don't think in my six years of rping I've ever truly done an rp without magic. That said, I'd really like to try Sci-Fi. And who knows, maybe you can show me the beauty of other rp genres. Hopefully we can make a cool rp world together. Or if you're more of a fandom person I have a few fandoms I'd like to try. Star Wars, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, Elite: Dangerous, My Hero Academia, and Tokyo Ghoul are some of the fandoms I'm interested in right now. If you have any other fandom requests feel free to message me.\n\nAs for what I expect: It's gonna be that we use the same format, that you can spell, and that you can use correct grammar and punctuation. I can let post length go, especially since I can't go very long myself. I would like if you are able to respond multiple times a day. I have a job as well though, so I definitely understand the limiting factors, just make sure to keep me posted whenever you need to bounce. Other than that I would love to hear from everybody! I promise I'll respond even if I think that we won't jive just to make sure I give everyone a fair shake.",

I have lots of pregnancy related roleplay ideas, and I\u2019d love to hash out some of them! I have ideas as well that have nothing at all to do with pregnancy. Some are darker than others, but I\u2019d be down to do just about anything! As I said, I do have tons of ideas to share.. just message me and let me know some of your likes and dislikes and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll have some plots to share. Just as I\u2019ll be sharing my own, I\u2019d absolutely love to hear any ideas you might have as well! \n\nI write in the first person and I prefer to send about a paragraph or two per reply. I am very flexible though. :) Oh! And most of my ideas include NSFW content so you must be 18+!",

We're a small RP server that's been newly created on the platform Discord and we're looking for new members! As there's barely any communities for this Fandom, much less actually active communities, we're looking for fellow fans who would actually like to RP in a Hoseki AU. An interesting new take on the lore and the close knit community feel which can definitely be improved by community suggestions! If you're interested in joining us, please simply PM me on here and send in your discord name and I'll get to you as fast as I can. Cheers! Hope to see you around!   \n\n\n  \n((Posted this before after 14 days and the spam filters removed it for some reasons. Mods be kind plz :c))",

Im always on the lookout for more partners and i dont limit myself to just one at a time,\nIm looking for a detailed roleplayer interested  my below roleplay, sorry if its a bit messy but i hope it all makes sense (i encourage questions!)\nAs a note Im fine with nsfw topics, but im not looking for ERP, that stuff can be included, but not the focus. My roleplays i prefer to have a no limit when in comes to various topics as im not a fan of censoring myself. Concept art of my characters to further the detail i can offer (i also often draw scenes from longterm rps lol)\n\nI am really not a fan of heavy romance of slice of life roleplays, i like a bit more conflict and so on. So this roleplay will hopefully not just bubble down into both characters just having to end up together.\n\nSo If you're interested please dm me your discord and any questions.\nPlease dont comment, i have those notifications turned off\n\nROLE ----\n\nPerhaps it was time to find a new approach for this little 'problem' of yours.\nThis was a Modern day Soviet Union, id have you imagine how the world would go if simply one man went about his day a little differently to how it should have, If a meeting ran a little late, would he still be alive?\nThe Soviet union never fell, and it survived into the modern world is the eventual outcome of my story.\n\nA text came in, as you lay in bed the screen lit up and vibrated on the side table, just in time to stop you from drifting back into a sweet dream and the embrace of that ever eluding beauty who called to you. But taking a moment to adjust to the light you looked to find a text from a blocked phone number, \u201cBring 50% of my fee to the alleyway beside the Vishka bar in south city between 11-12 tonight, if you\u2019re late the deal is off.\nThere will be a car waiting for you there, get in it, bring what you can.\"\nThis was it, this contact was what you were waiting for ever since you were prompted to slipping a letter into an unmarked lock box at the moscow crosscountry railway. \nThey were an assassin, an associate told you that they were certainly the best, clean reliable and no strings attatched, but they were also one of those.... things.\n\nRemember what I said about what might happen when a man does something a little differently, well that was certainly the case. Years ago a German born Russian man was shot, the bullet moved just a bit to the left and missed his heart, that man went on to become a celebrated genetic scientist in the Soviet union, creating artificial life, it was a secret for a long time, but in 1998 an article was published by an underground paper that exposed these things for what they were, including a full list of names, and even some photos, it ruined many lives, but something like this couldn\u2019t be covered up, these things could be spotted by their violet eyes, while at first was thought to be a genetic issue now turns out to be an entirely different man made species of humans.\nMany of these things had family\u2019s with humans, relationships with children; friends and work, in a week it was gone, families destroyed, lives ruined.\nThey were moved to a new subsection off Moscow simply called \u2018South city\u2019 the men were reduced to work labour and many women worked as maids or other less than desirable jobs, to some humans they were fetishized, to most they were just animals.\n\nIt was said that there are no murderers in the soviet union, such things are such an American mindset, it helped those like this assassin you contacted, they swept it under the rug, in the instance Your brother was shot in the head? He spit in the face of an officer is what the report would say and youd never see of it again.\n\nChecking your watch you found your way to the neon lights of the Vishka bar, the noise of the drunkards and the smell of tobacco of the group smoking outside, turning into they alleyway you could see the old military escort vehicle sitting there, the passenger side door was left unlocked for you.\nThis was it, there was no backing out now.\n(You can choose anyone to be the target, I personally recommend this character hiring the assassin is a temp, and to have your main character either the target, or an associate of said target.\nThe start of this story after the meeting will focus a bit on the assassin (Me) up until meeting with the target, so you will need to be able to play more than one character for this role to work well.",

            "selftext": "Hello there!\n\nWith university starting again, I need something to pass the time between homework, lectures, project work, and even more homework. I'm hoping to just dive into a cute and casual slice-of-life kind of RP, you know just a wholesome romance without having to think too much about stakes and dark mysterious backstories and all that!\n\nI did have a character in mind who I would like to play, so hopefully you like the idea!\n\nHis name's Philip, he's a Scot born in England while his mother was studying at Cambridge, and she later found work in the US where they both live now. As for ages, at the youngest he could be 19 or so, but I can age him up all the way to 27 or 28 depending on what the scene calls for. He was raised by his single mother as a young kid, but again depending on the scene he sometimes can be part of a blended family too.\n\nLooks wise, he's probably slightly above average in height, pale skin, dark moppy hair, blue eyes. He would have a somewhat youthful face even as an adult, not much facial hair beyond a little stubble when he gets lazy and doesn't shave for a few days.\n\nHe also has a Newfoundland dog called Billy who is the goodest boy on the planet!\n\nHe's almost-blind from birth, not quite 100% but enough to qualify as legally blind for sure. He grew up training various martial arts from a young age like Judo, wrestling, and finally settling on BJJ/grappling as his \"thing\" I suppose, since that's where his disability is not too bad of a handicap. I think he'd be quite high-level at it, semi-pro as a competitor, and also teaching martial arts at all levels as his main day job.\n\nPersonality wise, he'd probably be quite an easy-going and upbeat guy, who just likes to stick to his routines and places he knows, he gets mentally overwhelmed sometimes but he definitely enjoys meeting new people!\n\nI actually have lots of ideas as to how they might meet, I'll tell but I would also love to hear yours!\n\n***\n\nIf you liked this little idea, hopefully we can chat some time soon, feel free to PM me your Discord and then we can talk more there!\n\nSee you soon!",

I'm seeking a man about my age, who is comfortable being a strong male lead in the story. After all this is a damsel in distress role play, so a manly brooding masculine figure would be perfect.  \n\nI can respond multiple times a day and would like someone else who can as well. I am on the PST zone and am active between 7am and 11pm, sometimes later. \n\nI'm looking to develop a prompt with someone who is open to romance, fantasy and medieval genres. I'm open to hashing out ideas and having lots of laughs as well. \n\nLittle about me:\nOOC is very important, I am looking for a pen pal as well as an RP partner. \nOpen to NSFW \nI am a nerd to the core, star wars, LOTR, gamer on PS4 and pretty much anything else nerdy other than anime. \n\nHope to hear from you soon!

I am okay with using reddit or discord to create the story on. \n\nIf this sounds interesting to you just drop me a DM and we can go for there and although I am looking for a RE partner if that's not your thing I am open to discussing other routes!

            "selftext": " Hello ! I'm Aku, I'm craving for some plot heavy roleplay so here's a bit more about my interests and roleplay style :\n\n**Style :** I'm writing in 3rd but I don't mind you writing in any style you like. **I won't write more than semi-para/1 para (except for descriptions and starters)** because I like dialog and I simply think the rp flows easier that way. I don't mind you writing lots, but simply know that I won't match your length :) I only rp on discord, whatsapp and skype. \n\nWhat I'm the most interested in lately is finding roleplays for my OC but I have other ones if you don't really like that one ! Here's a quick description of him :\n\nName : Akashi Kawada\n\nAge : to be set in the rp\n\nOutlook : short wavy dyed hair in a light purple but the color is often old and his black roots show. Asian, average height for a japanese man.\n\nPersonality : Akashi is quiet and not very talkative although he's polite, most people tend to forget about him apart from his hair. He doesn't bother dealing with people talking in his back but if threatened he can fight back surprisingly well. Once people get to know him more he turns out rather friendly but will stop any conversation about himself, his family or anything between he was fourteen and seventeen. In that time, Akashi was homeless and became a drug addict, it was a very hard hill to climb up but now he's clean, has a stable job at minimum wage and small flat, nothing much but it's already a lot to him. But he knows this is still fragile, and the call of the street is muffled in his head, but still there, whispering in his ears whenever something goes wrong...\n\nIf you like him, hit me up !\n\n**What I won't do :** I won't godmod your character. **No smut**. Of course it can be included in the plot but we'd have to fade to black.\n\nAlso if you're interested in playing a no.6 rp (I can play either shion or nezumi) or dmmd... (I can play clear and mizuki) Send me a message ! :D",

If you want to do this then pm a screen shot of this promp and pm. \n\nThe story: You and I have been on a little vacation. The gang said \u201cHave fun you two\u201d i chuckle hearing that. We got in your car and we went to a convention of scientists and experiments. You loved that kind pf stuff and wanted to learn how it all works. We then got to the hotel and took out our suitcases. I walk in and checked out our room while you walk around and started to talk to the other scientist. They explain small experiments that you wanted to try on me, but you don\u2019t have the right equipment to do so. We went out to eat at a cafe. I smile and order everything on the menu. You wanted a smoothie and a panini. Later on the next day you went shopping to get some equipment. I sigh softly missing scooby but you were too busy to miss anyone. Plus you got me and that\u2019s all you ever need. We went back to the hotel room and you start to show me a book of your experiments. \n\n(Continue from there.",

            "selftext": "Hello there!\n\nI am a 20 year old female in the EST time zone. My responses can range anywhere from a few paragraphs to a page. I suppose I would call myself literate if you had to put a label on it, and I would prefer the same from my partner. \n\nI have around 8-10 years of writing/RP experience. \n\nAs for the actual post, I am going to make this short and sweet. I am currently looking for long term partners for both a Star Wars and Detroit: Become Human RP!\n\nI will start with what I am looking for in D:BH : \n\nCharacters I can and will play: (I will put asterisks next to who I am most wanting to play). \n\nConnor (Main Character) *\nGavin (Main Character) *\nRK900 (Main Character or Side Character) *\nHank (Side Character)\n\n**Also basically the entire precinct crew as side characters. Tina, Chris, Fowler, etc.**\n\nMarkus (Main Character)\nSimon (Side Character)\nNorth (Side Character)\nJosh (Side Character) \n\nKara (Main Character)\nAlice (Side Character)\nLuther (Side Character)\n\nPairings: (I will put asterisks next to what I am most interested in). \n\nConnor x OC *\nGavin x RK900 *\nGavin x OC \nRK900 x OC *\nMarkus x Simon\nMarkus x OC\n\nBesides my m x m pairings, I do have a preference for a female OC if an OC is what you would like to use instead of a canon character. Nothing against anyone, it is just merely a preference. \n\nAs for plots, I would prefer if the plot took place post-revolution. The overall plot would of course depend on who you decided to play or who your OC is, but I could definitely throw some ideas out there or we could make up something together!\n\nNow for Star Wars: \n\nCharacters I can and will play:\n\nKylo Ren *\nBen Solo*\nRey *\nObi-Wan Kenobi *\nAnakin\nThe Mandalorian \nOC (M or F)\n\nPairings: \n\nKylo Ren/Ben Solo x Rey *\nKylo Ren/Ben Solo x OC *\nRey x OC\nObi-Wan Kenobi x OC *\nMando x OC\nOC x OC *\n\nGeneral plots: (Again generally depends on which canon or OC you decide to play) \n\n**SPOILERS IF YOU HAVEN\u2019T SEEN THE RISE OF SKYWALKER**\n\nThis would be an AU centering around what would happen if Ben had actually lived. I\u2019d personally just love to build on the world and some of the plot holes or questions left unanswered, Ben\u2019s internal struggles and dealing with his losses, his developing relationship with Rey, righting his wrongs of the past and Rey\u2019s own struggles with the revelation she is Palpatine\u2019s granddaughter and what they would do now that there is finally peace (or a presumed peace granted if the First Order doesn\u2019t rise again). Maybe even some force sensitive Finn mixed in there somewhere. \n\nWould they travel to bring order to the galaxy? Would a new threat present itself and try to turn either back to the dark side? Will the resistance so easily accept Ben amongst their ranks? Will they both finally be able to settle down? Will Ben leave? Who knows. \n\nI can play both Ben/Kylo or Rey though I have a preference for playing Ben/Kylo. \n\nAs for playing Kylo Ren (as those of us that love his dark self): \n\nIt could generally take place in between TLJ and TROS. If you wanted to play Rey, and develop more on the events of when she refused his hand vs. searching for Luke Skywalker. \n\nIf you instead decided on an OC, there are entire myriads of things we could do. But dependent on who your OC is, that leaves all of the ideas up in the air. Is Kylo searching for a fugitive, is there something special about them with the force, are they on the dark side and assisting in tearing down the resistance, or working to overthrow him? Or do we go further back and do Ben\u2019s days with the Jedi Order and his transition from Ben Solo to Kylo Ren? The possibilities are endless. \n\nStrictly OC\u2019s honestly there is any aspect you could explore. The dark and light side, the mandalorians, the bounty hunters, simple people living simple lives, force sensitives, apprentices to Vader or even Kylo, smugglers, etc etc etc etc. \n\nThe Mandalorian I\u2019d prefer to pair with an OC if possible, but who doesn\u2019t love adventures with The Child and all of the shenanigans associated with that?\n\nAs for Obi-Wan, I\u2019d prefer to do something either set before Order 66 (Obi and Anakin shenanigans) or during when Obi-Wan is forced into hiding. If you decided on an OC, again the possibilities are in abundance. Feel free to throw all of your ideas my way.\n\nNone of these ideas are set in stone! If you have something or if you have a preference for brainstorming something together, that is perfectly acceptable just as well. \n\nIf you need a writing sample then I would be more than happy to send you one. \n\nI do not RP smut so please note it will be absent in the rp. I am however all for the angst, drama, and fluff associated with romance themes. \n\nIf this peaks your interest just send me a message and we can discuss! (: \n\nMy platforms are Reddit PM, Email, Google Docs, Discord, Skype, and Kik. \n\nThanks and I hope to hear from you soon!",

I have played both Death and Dream in those settings.\n\nLiterate preferred, 2-3 lines minimum.\nWill probably be via Discord or Skype, depending on your preference.\n\nPlease feel free to comment or direct message me!\n\nThank you for your potential interest!",

Figured that was a positive at least, it was already bad enough with my total inability to talk - and no idea of *why* i was like this at all, other than it had something to do with that loss - having more memories of them would've likely only made it worse.\n\nI'd spent most of my life at an orphanage by now, luckily it was at least a good one, surrounded by people that genuinely cared for our wellbeing. Life wasn't all too bad! And yet, I still had my issue... many of them. Wasn't all too uncommon for me to hide away in my room and keep to myself, not feeling all too welcome when I can't even talk and join in on a conversation. I never really did have a close friend.\n\nAt least, not until I met you. So the question is then; who are you? Another person in a similar situation to myself? A fresh out of school employee? Or maybe your parents are considering adopting, and you're dragged along.\n\nRegardless, somehow, someway, we end up spending time together and finding that we actually get on pretty well, and things build from there...\n\n\n(Hello! I had this idea come to me last night and figured it could be fun to play out and it'd be a fun, sweet, fluffy RP with a few darker elements (namely my character's personal issues) to keep things interesting over time and give some sense of progression!)\n\n(So then, if you're interested send me a message and let's discuss further yeah? I prefer to play on discord but it's not a total requirement for me or anything :) I can quite happily play here as well. So, let's talk!)",

(Dialogue is an obvious exception) I'd also prefer 18+, since there will no doubt be violence and other mature themes. Romance is an option as well, but I really only write MxF pairings. I'm open to all kinds of plots, and I have an idea of my own.\n\nMy character gets taken prisoner in the settlement that yours lives in. Your character breaks mine out of captivity, but only on the condition that my character takes yours with them when they go. Maybe your character has never been outside the safety of the settlement. Maybe they need help finding something, or maybe they just have the urge to explore the ruined world. \n\nAs for apocalyptic causation: I'm pretty open. Nuclear winter? I'm in. Zombies? You bet. Global pandemic? Gross, count me in. Some kind of monsters that hunt at night? Terrifying, I love it. \n\nIf you're interested, shoot me a message. If you have some ideas of your own, include them; that's a big plus. I hope to hear from you soon!",

            "selftext": "Hi there, \nI am a M in my 20's so I am looking for someone around the same age as me. I have been RPing for over five years, but most of the time I have been the one carrying so I am looking for someone that can help me carry the RP so that I don't get bored with it. I am looking for a more casual style of RP with less rules and more enjoyment of the story. Lets get into specifics:\n\nStyle:\nI don't have a stylistic preference outside of the causal nature. \n\nTypes of RPs:\nI enjoy romance and action in general. I am ok with NSFW things, but they won't be the focus of the RP. For action, I do enjoy action, but I would rather have most combat be me vs you because it sucks to fight yourself all the time. \n\nSubjects:\nIf you are interested I have several ideas that I want to try to do such as: \n1. A polyamorous relationship that is a group of people trying to work through this unique relationship style.\n2. A post-apocalyptic empire's princess is nearly killed by her betrothed husband and she is dumped in the wastes and saved by a Nomad leader that has to deal with whether or not he should let her stay with the group of people that he is leader of.\nThese are just two examples. I have other ideas and things that I am interested in such as the Fate series, the SCP foundation, LoTR, Dragon Age, Persona 5, and others. Please ask and I can tell you.\n\nPlatforms:\nI have kik, Discord, WeChat, and E-mail, so it's basically what you want to have. I prefer Discord or kik. \n\nOther:\nUS Eastern Time Zone. In the interest of full disclosure, I should also mention that I will be moving to China in July, so I will be shifting time zones at that time. \nI have a huge exam on Feb 15, so I might go quiet for a while at a time, but after that I will have lots of time. \nI am usually good at responding, especially if we use kik or Discord\nI like a communicative partner that tells me how they feel \n\nIf you have any other questions please let me know! I hope to hear from you soon.",

            "selftext": "Hello! What is a classic fantasy RP? I define it as a story driven, world building, relationship developing roleplay that includes adventure, romance and sometimes darker themes. There is nothing better than creating a story one on one with a like minded individual.\n\nI'm a post as you can writer. I enjoy posts with substance; you don't have to write a novel each post, but at least a paragraph is preferred. I'm looking for a long-term roleplay that slowly builds a world and see's the characters grow over time. I love characters with depth; personality, flaws, back story, etc. I have a few characters I enjoy playing, below is a simple prompt for each of them. If any of them interest, you or you have any ideas PM me.\n\n1. Meet Alyra, daughter of the Mad King, Tavaris, lord of the northern mountains. Alyra has been traveling in the shadows for nigh a month after her escape from her once home. Her father sends his minions to retrieve Alyra and return her to her father, and her doom. Able to fight off what has come her way thus far, she finds herself hoping for a place to lay low or something to change her fate.\n2. In a world full of humans, elves, and dwarves; among other races. Kira finds herself hiding beneath hooded robes. As a tiefling she is still feared, shunned. With no memory of her past, she became an assassin for a secret organization of mages at a young age. Kira travels where she is told and kills whoever is on her list. While driven to hide Kira is a bold and fun-loving girl who has more than once found herself drunk in a tavern dancing on a table or starting a brawl. She never knows who her next kill will be or who'll she'll meet.\n3. This is my last prompt, but this is my most open character. Auri is a newer character I've been working on and I'd love to toss her out into the world. She's spirited but naive. Fiery but timid at times. There is a lot to learn about her and if you come up with an idea or we come up with one together I'll more than likely use her.",

I've tried a lot of my coping skills and none of them have been effective, so I'm moving on to the next one: distraction. I'm in the mood for a hurt/comfort type of role play, where my character is in distress (physically or emotionally) and your character helps them through it.\n\nI'm willing to play an OC or Nancy Wheeler from Stranger Things, whichever you prefer. The role play will take place on a private discord server. Let me know via PM if you're interested!",

            "selftext": "Howdy, all! I've been a lifelong fan of the Elder Scrolls series. I grew up playing Morrowind, then moved on to Oblivion and eventually Skyrim when they came out. Recently I've been rediscovering these games, and I'd love to make a story set in Tamriel, with someone else who loves the Elder Scrolls universe.\n\nYou don't have to be super familiar with the lore. I'm not looking for a lore-heavy story, and while I'm open to a different type of roleplay, what I had in mind was a D&amp;D-style adventure, where our characters travel together from place to place, fighting off monsters and visiting towns. I'm generally a more lighthearted roleplayer who likes to insert a bit of fun and humor sometimes. There's a time for dark and serious moments, but if you're looking for some kind of no-nonsense grimdark setting, I'm afraid you wouldn't like me.\n\nWho would our characters be? Well, that depends. I didn't really have one in mind, because I create different characters for each individual roleplay. The only thing set in stone is that I'd prefer to play a male. But I'll be happy with whoever you want to play, whether it's a Breton necromancer, a Redguard noblewoman, a Nord assassin, or an alcoholic Khajiit.\n\nPost length isn't a big deal to me - I can vary from one paragraph to a bunch, depending on what's needed. I'm also in the CST time zone, if that matters. I'm usually busy with college, so I may only have time for a couple replies each day. If you're okay with that, and are interested, great! I'd like to hear your thoughts and ideas, and we can work out the details over PM. Hope to hear from y'all!",

However, even with the soreness and exhaustion, he was still in a far better state than his opponent.  He watched the man in front of him slump into the sand, the eyes of his enemy slowly closing as he breathed his last breath, blood that moments before had been pumping out of the wound that Lucas had landed on his neck now slowly do a rapidly diminishing stream. The warrior had put up quite the fight, and it had been all that Lukas could do to hang on in certain parts of the battle, dodging and evading the man's deadly spear, constantly working closer to strike with his blade. \n\nBut ultimately all that mattered was that he was here now, standing over the body of his opponent, the crowd cheering and screaming for him. The Gladius felt heavy in his hand, and the shield in his other felt like it was made of granite. But still, he felt absolutely electrified by the crowd's screaming and chanting his name, so loud in fact that he felt it vibrate his body. That vibration, that incredible volume, was something that he couldn't help but relish.  It meant he had survived.  And more than that, he had won.\n\nWith that in mind, he circled the arena, waving to the crowd and letting them touch his hand before walking back to the pits below, making way for the next gladiators.\n\n\n\nHello everyone, I hope you liked my post.

I'm looking for an Inuyasha for a rp where Shippo asks him to train him and help him make him stronger, so Inuyasha takes him off and bonds with him while he trains him! I don't mind if you're not a perfect Inuyasha. I prefer communication over anything else, so let me know if you get uncomfortable at any time or if you have any questions, ideas, or concerns you want to discuss. Thank you!\n\nA little bit of information about me: I'm 20 years old, female, and I have way too much time on my hands. I'm currently on season 6.\n\nWhat I'm looking for in a partner: 18+, paragraph/novella style roleplay, 3rd person, and someone who has more time on their hands than one reply a day can provide.\n\nI'd prefer to do the rp on discord. If you have any questions, DM me or ask them in the comments, thank you!  \n(Cross posted on r/inuyasha as well)",

I\u2019m an 18 year-old who is currently working full time and hoping to go back to college soon! I live in the US and run off of EST. \n\nI prefer a literate style, about a paragraph minimum. However, let me know what you prefer, as I\u2019m not picky and very laidback.\n\nI\u2019m an avid fan of The Witcher throughout all of its adaptions\u2014 the books, the Netflix series, and the games! I have no requirements whether you\u2019re familiar with all of those or have only seen the Netflix series, I\u2019m flexible. If you need help with the lore, I\u2019d be glad to give you a hand.\n\nI\u2019m looking for both canon and non-canon roleplay. I am willing to write as Geralt, Renfri, Yennefer, and possibly more- however, I have not written them before. If we choose to pursue a non-canon story, I have a few ideas for both characters and storylines that we could discuss. \n\nI am enjoy romance (no gender/ship preference), but it isn\u2019t essential for me. When it comes to the gender of my characters, I also have no preference.\n\nYou\u2019ll find that I\u2019m easygoing and friendly, so feel free to talk to me. Message me if you\u2019re interested!",

And now I got so frustrated that I\u2019ll post here\n\nI'm 19 and have about one year of roleplaying experience. I use discord and I\u2019m able to write messages almost the entire day. I like roleplaying all kinds of stuff, but recently I\u2019m very interested in a rp in the Witcher universe, because I watched the show and played a few of their games recently. I like my partners also being 18+, not only if we want to do some nsfw stuff, but I like my partners being similar age.\n\nSo if you\u2019re 18+, interested in doing a rp with me and live in the timezone UTC+1, write me a dm!",

            "selftext": "Hello All.  \n  \nI'm currently looking to set up a My Hero Academia x Dragon Ball Z Crossover rp. Sounds a bit weird I know but given they're both Shonen's and have similarities I think it's something that would pan out in a really interesting way. Essentially a DBZ character (Whom I would play) would end up trapped in the MHA setting. I'm looking for someone to play a member of Class 1-A to play off of. Themes would match MHA, comedy, drama, action etc.  \n  \nThe RP aims to explore the fun nature of the characters involved and the situations they could get mixed up in. However this would be platonic and I'm not really looking to do pairings for this rp (this also means no smut). It's more a master student kind of situation as well as just exploring and enjoying the world that MHA inhabits.   \n  \nI'm looking for people mostly familiar with MHA, DBZ familiarity isn't required. I see at least multi para rp'ing with a good eye for detail and world building. I'm happy to GM most of the rp but any suggestions and ideas I'm happy to receive as I want it to be a collaborative experience. I'm looking for multi para rp'ers with a mind for detail ideally. This idea is a bit of a passion project for me, a long running story that would run through different arcs, covering a wide range of scenarios, scenes and story lines.    \n  \nIf this kind of adventure in the fun setting of MHA appeals to you then please don't hesitate to DM me. Thanks!",

            "selftext": "Hey hey Reddit! So today I've decided to take one of my long loved ideas for a story that I wished to have turned into some form of media into a roleplay plot. I didn't see it as fair that something so dear to me was kept locked away just because I couldn't make it into what I wanted. So anyway, here's the basic idea!\n\nThis world is like most common video-game fantasy worlds you'd find in anime. (such as Danmachi or Log Horizon) No, the world itself is not a game, but it has mechanics within it that are very similar to what a game would be! For instance; at the age of 18 people can visit a Records Hall to register for a Stat Card (or S-Card for short) to see where their abilities lie! In a casual setting these cards would be used as sort of resum\u00e9s, verifying one's qualification for a certain job. But in the case of Adventurers, it opens up a whole new world for them! Their stats allow them to wield better weapons, wear better armor, and cast better spells! And unlike others, they can slay monsters to level up and increase their skills!\n\nIn total, there are six Stats: Strength, Agility, Constitution, Intelligence, Magicka, and Luck. They're all pretty self explanatory, the most useless skill in the eyes of Adventurers being Luck because it doesn't allow you to have better gear.\n\nIronically, *you* were unfortunate enough to have below average stats for everything. Everything besides Luck which stood at an absurd level of 99! But your dreams of becoming an Adventurer are crushed when you're told the true nature of the stat, and walk solemnly home to never live your dream...\n\n...or do you?\n\nIf you're interested at all, do send me a message! I will also answer any questions you may have!",

Ideally, I'd love that the GM in question would be knowledgeable about political and social issues. (To paint a better picture - A person that finds House of Cards interesting). That's because I'm looking to write a story/rp in which we'd guide a country through various events. The setting may be anything, from fantasy, through history and modern settings, to scifi. \n\nHowever, if you don't find that interesting, we can definitely think of something else. I'll be happy with any kind of GM experience.\n\nIf that post caught your interest, be sure to PM me, where I can provide you with other means of communication. I have Discord and Kik as the most reliable ones. I hope to hear from you soon, take care!",

I keep my replies around 4+ lines and do my best to reply quickly. if I'm awake you'll get a reply within 5 minutes.

My town has only one general store and a cafe. While small the town is beautiful and green. there's even a locals-only beach. At night the lack of streetlights makes the sky look incredible with 1000s of stars visible in every direction. While the town doesn't offer much for most people the quiet draws them in and they usually end up sticking around for the peace that is offered in such a small town. on my daily walk with my dog, however, I find the for sale sign on the farm next door is now plastered with half a dozen sold signs and a rather large truck is in the driveway as well as a small family car. Part of me wants to introduce my self and part of me wants to hide. I decide it's not worth hiding from everyone forever and take the chance to introduce myself to my new neighbour. I walk slowly up your driveway and take my time so I can gather my thoughts and think up an adequate greeting. \"hello! I'm your new neighbour, Bryce. I was wondering if you needed any help\" I call out towards the moving truck politely hoping you can hear me.  \n\n\nSample prompt 1 (married)  \nI live in a small farming town on the edge of an ever-expanding city.

I'm working to build a medium space ship with a sizeable crew space and cargo space. your focusing on getting off the station as soon as you can incase the remaining people turn on the royals and try to take their supplies. our mutual goals and supplies mean we may have to work together to make this dream happen.  \n\n\nSample prompt 3  \nIt's a cold and lonely start to winter for the poor peasants. the food supply dwindles, the water supply has frozen and they are running out of wood to heat there homes. however, I am in an excellent mood. as today I am going to meet my potential future queen from the next kingdom over. a beautiful young woman no doubt, but not the type I would have normally gone for. she is far too interested in making the people happy and far less interested in the needs of the kingdom. the marriage is more of an alliance with her kingdom and an agreement has been reached for them to provide much-needed supplies such as food and the one thing my kingdom lacks. coal. the dirty black lumps were priceless and only a few kingdoms had access. in return, we have agreed to share our high-quality iron ore and low-quality gold ore. mid-train of thought I am interrupted by the clattering of hooves on the cobblestone that makes up the castle grounds. I move over to the window and see you with your 6 man escort. to make sure to stress my importance I wait 10 minutes or so. before heading down to meet with you. finding you sitting one leg crossed over the other on my royal throne rather than in the chairs before it that was prepared for you and your escort. I watch unsurprised as one of your servants provide you with an apple. knowing of course how rare they tend to be in other kingdoms. I decide to sit down at the other side of the room in the chairs intended for you and your escort and look around the room. taking in the stained glass windows and enjoying the statues of past royal family members then taking in the crest hung above the door. a red dragon on black background. fitting as no one had ever seen a dragon and even fewer still saw much food these days. after a minute or two I casually ask \"so which one of you is here for the wedding?\" waving my hand around dismissively and feigning a lack of interest.   \n\n\nSample prompt 4  \n\n\nKnowing this is the big day, I have set everything in the correct place and sorted everything into the preferred order from different animal parts to herbs through to bone and rock. to mixing pots to kettles to pans. I have walls of chemicals and mixtures just waiting for the perfect willing test subject. I have agreed to provide them with money in return for testing and my research has led me to a powerful potion that seems to make the user of said potion fall in love with the one that combined their blood with the clear liquid. I took my time finding the correct subject for the potion and did my best to convince them to take the money and participate in the trial. doing my best to inform them that this liquid was a new drug used to elevate mood. I did not expect however for the potion to be permanent. because of this, my life was about to be turned upside down and I was about to end up in a relationship I never expected. you sat across the table from me as I poured the clear liquid into a small shot glass for you to test. \"don't worry it's tasteless\" I say as I push the glass towards you.  \n\n\nPrompt 5  \nit was a cold wet lonely night, the sky was a beautiful black, there was no moon tonight, the water glowed in the distance. a small spark in the distance growing ever larger. from this distance, the plane was all but unrecognisable. however, from onboard the plane, you were more than aware of what was happening. your plane your friends and family on board were coming down hard. and all you could do is sit and wait. the streak growing ever closer to the tiny island as you and your family sat in panic. I as the cook took a seat next to you and bucked in. placing my self in the brace position to protect my self from the impact. several minutes past as the pilots tried to get help using the radio getting nothing but horrible static and silence. growing ever closer to the ground. a minute more passes before the plane this the ground. breaking into pieces on impact. our section is the rear of the plane. the only part to survive mostly intact. moments after the impact I wake next to you. painfully aware we are the only two left of the plane's crew. your entire family and all your friends are dead. you're trapped with me on an unknown abandoned island. I unclip my belt. doing my best to shake you awake hoping you're alive. and I'm not trapped here all alone.",

I lived all my years in that ancient rumor shadowed manor, fattened by decadence and luxury, and yet I began to tire of... conventional extravagance.

With relic and ritual, I bent every effort towards the excavation and recovery of those long-buried secrets, exhausting what remained of our family fortune on... swarthy workmen and... sturdy shovels. At last, in the salt-soaked crags beneath the lowest foundations, we unearthed that damnable portal of antediluvian evil.

Driven to raving madness and bloodshed, dark things began to appear, corrupting all but the most sanctimonious of prefectures.

            "selftext": " \n\nHi there, 30 year old female rper looking for long term roleplay partners for the Marvel fandom. I only do Canon characters (no OCs please). This might read as harsh but I know what I like, don't like and what I'm looking for and would rather there be no confusion so I'm trying to make sure it's right to the point.\n\n**About me/What I'm looking for:**\n\n* 30 (as stated above), Central USA timezone. I'm a night owl and tend to be up and online between 3pm and 5am\n* I'm fluent only in English, sorry\n* I double, triple and more on characters and ask that my partner do the same. Do not message me if you can not write more then one character please. List of Characters I write will be at the end of the post. *No I wont DM/GM a roleplay.* \n* Literate writing only. I can write anywhere from 2-7 paragraphs and expect the same in return.I ONLY write in third (3rd) person.\n* I can and do write gender-bent characters as well as all forms of queer/LGBTQ+ characters.\n* M/M ships mainly but can do M/F (will only write the female in those ships).

I will happily create a private server for us to write in 1x1 where everything can be neatly contained.\n* I write a mix of Comics and MCU, ***please have knowledge of the comics as well as films as I work from both***\n\nI like to do more then one relationship in a universe/roleplay. Not a single focus on a single ship as that gets boring after awhile. I also like my characters being able to interact with more then just one (1) person during storylines. This is where being able to write more then one character comes in handy and why I request that my partner(s) are able to do the same. If I am writing Steve, Tony, Clint and Peter I'd ask my partner to write other characters so that we both have the chance to play off each other.\n\n**What I wont do**\n\n* No underage characters/Ships\n* No Non Con/Dub Con\n\n**What I will write**\n\n* Anything else.. Really.\n* OmegaVerse (check)\n* Alternate Universe Mafia setting? (check)\n* AUs (Alternate Universe) with everyone being human? (check)\n* Rewrite Endgame?

            "selftext": "**Welcome to MHA: Protect and Serve!**  \n\n\nThis is a literate roleplay server set in an alternate universe version of MHA's canon. In our version of MHA's Japan, the entire cast of the series has grown old and lived out their careers. Deku was the last holder of One For All, and never passed it down. No canon characters allowed - all Original Character roleplay. I fully intend to keep the numbers on this server small, so that every player can become familiar with each other and grow attached to our characters together. I highly recommend that you join only if you have past experience with literate RP.  \n\n\nThis server focuses primarily on the lives of the students, with mostly slice-of-life focused RP that is occasionally punctuated by classes, events, and plot development. The progression of our students will mirror that MHA, with events like our own Sports Festival and Provisional License Exam. UA as a school is mostly unchanged, however, the students and teachers are all new!  \n\n\nVillain activity will be slowly integrated into the RP as we continue. For right now it's mostly students and heroes.  \n\n\nAs the owner, I am big on quality control and fine-tuning character bios. I'll want to work with pretty much every single person who joins. Don't feel weird if I try to workshop some of your ideas with you, I enjoy the discussion.  \n\n\n**You might like this server if you:**\n\n\\- Respect your writing, and care about what you create.  \n\\- Enjoy reading.  \n\\- Like organizing events and long lasting character arcs.  \n\\- Enjoy writing a pseudo slice-of-life series of interactions, mostly focused on the students of UA and their classes, punctuated by large events and plot development.  \n\\- Like creating three dimensional characters with unique flaws and strengths that change over time.  \n\n\n**This server probably isn't for you if:**\n\n\\- You want an emphasis on romance or erotic roleplay.  \n\\- You want to roleplay heroes or villains exclusively.  \n\\- You like low-literacy roleplay with very short and simple posts.  \n\\- You want to insert a character from another anime/show/movie into the MHA setting.  \n\\- You want to roleplay a pre-existing canon character.",

If Azula didn\u2019t go insane and Zulu betrayed Team Avatar one final time in hopes of restoring his own legacy with his nation?\n\nWell I have a proposition! I\u2019d love to play against an Azula, portraying Zuko if that did just happen! Maybe Azula convinced Zuko to join her cause instead? The possibilities are endless but primarily I\u2019d love to write out the scenario, if Zuko became Firelord Azula\u2019s aid in defeating Katara and the rest of Team Avatar toward the end! We could say hypothetically that he joins her as her primary advisor when she becomes Firelord. There could be a lot of inner turmoil that Zuko faces of course but I\u2019d imagine it being a much darker world right after the rise of the Fire Nation during the events of Sozin\u2019s comet. All of the intricacies can be discussed further should you be interested, as it is a fairly new idea of mine. I\u2019d love to flesh this out.~ \n\nI use either PM\u2019s or Discord primarily. I write literate 3rd person narrative (semi-para to novella) and have no issues with adult themes. I\u2019m looking for a long term partner, to get my mind of a lot of things going on right now in my life. I really need a good committed distraction.~ \n\nHope to hear from you, should this interest you! :)",
