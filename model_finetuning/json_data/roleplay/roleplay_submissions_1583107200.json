            "selftext": " Hey there! I'm Trio, I'm from the UK, and I'm looking for some RP partners! I am a third-person writer, looking to write with anyone (DM/GM or OCs), in a variety of settings. I tend to write a few paragraphs per reply, but honestly as long as it doesn't become just one-liners, I'm happy with most lengths! I enjoy using original or established worlds, but much prefer using OCs to canon characters.\n\nI have some themes I like listed below, but right now I am dying to play a Western! I've been playing too much RDR2 and I want to write in that kind of end-of-the-west era. I've included my other interests below in case you'd prefer any of those!\n\nThe themes I am interested in are: westerns (eg Red Dead), fantasy (Skyrim, DnD, Dragon Age, Witcher, etc), medieval, steampunk, gothic-historical, cyberpunk, sci-fi, Star Wars (particularly SWTOR-era), pirates...\n\nBasically, I like a lot. I have a preference for darker themes, and so would prefer my partner to be over 18. I also prefer to main a female character, but am happy to have multiple characters of any gender and/or sexuality.\n\nI will only RP over Discord because it's easy, so if you're interested hit me up with some ideas and let's make something amazing :)",

I am mostly looking for someone who has no life like me and is interested in writing. For style, I don't care honestly. I am a quality over quantity person so keep that in mind.\n \nPLEASE DON'T MESSAGE ME IF YOU ARE UNDER 18. The RPs I would like to do won't necessarily be NSFW, but I am past the age where I feel comfortable writing with those who are under 18. \n\nI have a couple of ideas that I would like to toss at you to maybe spark interest: \n\n1. In a world modern world of monsters and humans, there exists a single reaper queen who is the last of her kind. She has lived for almost 200 years alone but as a celebrity of sorts. Reapers are able to feel other reapers telepathically but for all that time, her mind has been alone, until one day she hears another reaper in her mind. \n\n2. Set in a dark fantasy world, a new threat has arisen to consume the world with flames. You and your band of champions will come together to face the evil. This one can be light and dark at different points, there will be blood and there will be fluff \n\n3. A space Odyssey where your character is exploring the universe as one of the last humans alive. This one ideally be dark.\n\nWe can bounce around some ideas if you are interested. I prefer discord or reddit. I am in the EST as well.\n \nHope to hear from you soon.",

            "selftext": "Hey there,\n\nI am looking to roleplay something in the universe, whether it be before SOTC or after The Last Guardian time frame.   I would like to find a way to either find a way to explore the forbidden lands prior to their forbiddenness, after it was sealed through a future generation or after TLG to find and locate the futuristic tech that no one seems to understand how to use.   If someone would like to have a cute little shipping between the two characters, I would love that.  My character could be a horned girl from the village or we could try something that starts a whole bigger problem.   \n\nOr, alternatively, we could start something that continues after Ico where they live in the village and perhaps my character is taken to be the sacrifice for the queen.    I just want to roleplay in the world, and I know it's pretty uncommon to find a partner, but I'm sure we can work out something.   I was thinking also that maybe our characters could figure out a new item from the \"old\" civilization that only works with the two of them?  I feel there is stuff we can explore in the settings, and since I've almost finished the book: Ico: Castle in the Mist, I would probably take some of the elements from the village life.  \n\nThe idea is that something big would happen, possibly to infect the smaller locations or a bigger one, and our characters are involved on some big level while either being in trouble or get involved in something.   We could use multiple themes too!  \n\nAs for a partner, I am searching for this:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Adult partner, no children.**\n* **3rd person only.** \n* **Multi-Paragraph (Usually &gt;2, but quality over quantity.)**\n* **Be open to OOC talk**\n* **Respond fairly frequently, a few times a week.**\n* **I prefer 90% plot/10% NSFW.**\n* **I do want a romantic subplot.**",

A first order platoon tracks a strange distress signal thats been bouncing around for nearly 24 years. Upon arriving they find a crashed ship, clearly that of a bounty hunters. They investigate the destruction, caked in dust and damage from another ship. \n\n\"sir.. This blackbox signal is over 20 years old. Looks like scavengers already got what they could from it\" Their Commander nodded \"I'll radio it in, HQ this is fireteam Zeta we..\" another trooper then interrupted \"sir I found something!\". Redirecting his attention the the soldiers find the commander is now confused. Locked away is what appears to be an Imperial Storm trooper inside carbonite. \"..We found something.\" he finishes then ends the transmission to HQ.\n\nMoments later they lower the frame onto the main deck of the ship and begin the defrost proccess. \"sir for how long this has been here, it's unlikely he survived.\" the Commander sets his hand on the soldiers shoulder. A moment later the old trooper rose to life, his helmet falling to the side as he gazed around at the newly brandished might of the first order storm troopers. \n\n\"can you hear me son?\" the commander asked as he leaned in. Suddenly the cabin was lit ablaze by blaster bolts. \"sir! Resistance fight- *AAAGH!*\". After a few more moments the room fell silent. The men who seemed to free him from his prison fell, Now decimated. The old Imperial rose to his feet with an ancient Jedi weapon he had been frozen with, gripping it tightly as footsteps drew closer. \n\n\nHey! I hope you like the premise of my star wars story. We would follow an Imperial deserter and your character in the years leading up to the sequel trilogy. Except to see lots of Storm Troopers and plenty of Kylo Ren! As always your character is up to you! Feel free to hit me up, thanks!",

            "selftext": "  \n\nHello everyone who stopped by to read my posting under the Roleplay Reddit. I am in the market for a Slice Of Life Roleplay or Fantasy. I would prefer Slice Of Life though if we are being honest with one another. I like writing and developing stories. The last partner I roleplayed with became boring and no matter how many times I tried to get out of the constant rut we were in he kept on being so repetitive. It drove me nuts. \n\nI would like the slice of life roleplay to include a little bit of ERP especially if we are consenting adults. The story must start out with meeting one another. Unless you might have an idea on how to start out with us knowing one another to begin with. I just think it can happen either way. I need something to fulfill the void I have had lately. \n\nI recently discovered Discord with another group I am in and I have enjoyed it far better than KIK. This is my new preferred method for roleplay. \n\nHow do you roleplay?\n\nAre you a paragraph person? \n\nDo you describe the scenery?\n\nDo you describe your character? Or do you have a reference picture? I myself have a reference picture of someone I like to play. \n\nDo you prefer first or third person?\n\nDaily responses or whenever you are available?\n\nSlice of Life must include Romance and hopefully your OC could have a backstory. \n\nLittle About Me : I am a 27 year old female. I have been roleplaying for about 6 years now going on 7. I live in the Mountain Time Zone but I hardly ever sleep so I am usually always around. I would like someone who can be with me to accompany my needs. \ud83d\ude0a I hope that is you!",

            "selftext": " \n\nHello, [r/Roleplay](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplay/)! I hope you're having a great day. I'm looking for a fun detailed RP to work out with you. Part of the fun, at least for me, is brainstorming the ideas with you to create something truly unique. So consider these roles as ideas, which can all be changed. Now, all of these roles are able to be changed up--nothing is ever set in stone.\n\nGreat let's get started &lt;3\n\n* **Murder Mystery College**\n\nWell this was just great, wasn' it? Perhaps you were a new College Professor, or simply just another student. Maybe even some kind of a boy genius who happened to skip enough grades that you've landed yourself at a prestigious university--whatever it might be, you found yourself in deep trouble. Filled with drama, mystery and murder. But who's doing it? And why? This can be dark, or all 'action' could be behind the scenes. I admit, I was a little inspired by the show Riverdale for this, because of it's campy angst and themes, but personally, I think we can create something much better than what the writers at Riverdale came up with. Haha.\n\n* **Secret Agent**\n\nEver wanted to be a secret agent? A James bond figure, a young man just getting into the field, an old veteran of the craft--perhaps an average joe who is mistaken for 007 himself and get's pulled into an adventure he could never have imagined! The story is quite simple in my head right now. A small latin-american island holds the world's most dangerous dictator who plans to terrorize the rest of the world into his own bidding through it's own secret connections, an oranisation going by ANOCANDA making this a world-wide threat. There'll be fun chase scenes, damsel's in distress, KGB Agents, as well as Latin American equivelants and other characters.\n\n* **Not so Holy**\n\nYou are shiprecked, and found on an island. In your regular life, you were a nobody, or perhaps an Anthropologist. You find yourself on the warm beaches of an unexplored land! And it just so happens you look like a god to the local natives. But, what happens when some of the Natives start to think you aren't exactly who you say you are? Will your secret be discovered? Will you be able to escape the island? Will you be able to redeem yourself?\n\n* **To Explore Where No Man has Gone Before!**\n\nThe year is 30XX, and the world has thankfully not been destroyed. In a new unified world you set out to explore the vastness of space with a rag-tag group of Spacewomen from all kinds of different cultures and countries. Much like Startrek, you are here to create diplomatic ties with different Space Colonies, explore uncharted planets, and so on. Of course, you ought to watch out--not all Alien species are friendly...Nor intelligent, and you may be in risk of a lot of serious trouble! How will you deal with an attack by space pirates? Dinosaur like monsters? Diseases... Who will you be? An Android? The Commander of the Ship? A family member who happened to tag along? Perhaps just a simple technician who happens to get caught in this mess.\n\n* **Small Town Horror/Slasher**\n\nI always loved those campy horror movies, the ones where a small town is taken over by a pack of Zombies, or a ghost, or even a serial killer slasher. I would like to Roleplay within one of these universes, be it one major big threat, or be it 'monster' of the week. There'll be cultists in the woods, graveyards, mansions, pesky trick or treaters and juvinile trouble.\n\n* **Time to Get Super**\n\nYou're special--maybe you didn't know it--but now you do. You've been discovered as being one of the special ones--you are a Superhero. This is a mixture of adventure and Slice of Life, it'll go between your average everyday life, as well as your life as a superhero. Some characters who you'll know in real life may also be superheroes who you don't exactly know the identity of, perhaps you'll even have a nice kiss from the girl you're crushing on without ever knowing that you were her masked hero. We can also do a Super-School like in X-men. But please, keep in mind that this would be completely an original creation!\n\nNOTE: If you are interested in making these RPs 18+ You must comfirm that you, AND your character are eighter eighteen years old or older. I will not make any acceptions. Thank you. Please also specify if you'd like this to be 18+.",

Story building is my main focus. However some nsfw stuff can be included, but just not the focus. My roleplays i prefer to have a no limit when in comes to various topics as im not a fan of censoring myself.\n\nI am really not a fan of heavy romance of slice of life roleplays, i like a bit more conflict and so on. So this roleplay will hopefully not just bubble down into both characters just having to end up together.\n\nSo If you're interested please dm me your discord and any questions.\nPlease dont comment, i have those notifications turned off\n\nROLE ----\nThe soviet union continues to fight on, with the war being long expanded past what our own history tells us. \nJapan never woke the sleeping giant and for the most part the war never expanded beyond europe, the British people run out of money and the war slows as the german soil encompassed most of europe and into the UK, the soviet union holds strong against the germanic forces and holds firm on the western front.\n.\n.\nEarly morning german advances came across a small unit working on a prototype vehicle that had broken down during a drill, its armour held strong but being outnumbered brought about the end, the vehicle went up in flames, when the russian forces were pushed back and the fire was out the recon group went to recover the prototype. The hatch was stuck, once opened the first man was shot. And a second injured.\n.\n.\n\" We brought her in late last night, she wont answer questions or attempt to speak we dont know if she even understands german\"  the young nurse spoke soft and simply as it was never wise to ramble before a ranking officer, leading you toward a heavy set door pretty much like any other in the POW camp, She was keeping it sweet and short, but held respect in her tone, the documents talked the inspection of a recently captured area in Ukraine where they recoveed the tank and surprisingly extracted the still live commander, and while the state was often interested in finding out what their enemy was up to, if this commander knew more about the vehicle that was enough to want her kept alive.\n.\n.\nThe policy of treatment of POWs was strict, often higherups would have to sign off on any medical supplies used on a prisoner, as such no morphine or anything above a basic meal for any POW, meaning she was no doubt in pain, one hand folded over her stomach, the other pinned up with a cuff holding her to then frame, she would stare up at the ceiling above her, watching the light sway as the people moved about upstairs.\nAnd in accordance to normal policy her wounds cleaned and bandaged and an evaluation was taken, One side of her face was uncovered and relatively undamaged. Her eyes pale and lifeless, no effort left to fight even if she was able.\n\nThis woman however wasn't even human, a early humanoid creation as an experimental unit of soldiers. While what these people are is a mystery and unknown to the german forces. Things would soon change.\nHumanoids are Soviet, your character isn't necessarily german, but is german aligned at the very least.",

I've been dying to do this roleplay for a while! \nBefore I continue, there is an age requirement \nAs I am underaged, I would like my roleplay partner to be near 14-17 as that's around my age group.\n\nThis roleplay is inspired by the song Hellfire from the hunchback of notre dame. I fell in love with the thought of a character making an emotionless king feel things he's never felt before. The king goes mad trying to find out who she is, but just ends up falling more and more for her by the minute and he tries to overcome his ever growing love. This is a dark roleplay though,  as my characters backstory is pretty horrific. This is the basic plot and it can go anywhere as long as whoever roleplays this with me is okay with however this may turn out. Maybe he kills the girl? Maybe he goes mad and shuts everyone out? Who knows, this roleplay is just a fun way for me to live my little fantasy of wanting to be esmerelda from the hunchback of notre dame! ^-^ if interested, please comment, then we can become more acquainted and start talking and getting to know each other!

            "selftext": "Hola! I\u2019m Azul! I started roleplaying in 2007, so I've seen it all. Script style, paragraphs, novellas, google docs, you name it, my feet have been wet. This includes what the subject matter and themes I have done with my partners. If you think you're going to ask a weird question or request? Never fear, I have probably done it.\n\nI pretty much have no rules when it comes to the actual roleplaying. Go nuts on the plots, I can play some serious stuff, but please be either 18/21 or older! I double or nothing. You play your character and my character love interest; I will do the same for you. There was one partner I had who would switch with me, I would play his part, and once we were done with that scene, we did mine. We can do that format too, although I'm in it for the long haul so I won't respond well. Then there\u2019s you the potential partner. I only ask to let me know when you are uncomfortable. I know I tend to spam; my internet connection is ridiculously bad. I live in the middle of nowhere Texas, thus the lowest speed possible. It goes in and out like a bad habit. If you haven\u2019t heard from me, I lost connection. I am in the Central Time zone. I also ask to not force me into playing with you and respect my opinion. Both had been broken and I blocked people before because they were being scruffy nerf herders. I go for Canon/OC because who doesn\u2019t want to indulge a little bit? This also means I don\u2019t care if you wanna do self inserts. It\u2019ll be fun, so why not?\n\nHere's what I'm looking for. If you're not sure if I know a fandom then please don't be afraid to ask.\n\nSTAR WARS: PLEASE!! Bingeing Clone Wars on Disney Plus and the new season is slowly coming out, waiting ever so patiently, and I'm fully on board with giving this a try. This includes the movies, except for ROS, and Rebels. I'm kinda willing to try the Mandalorian, but I don't know if a lot of people are willing to go for my plot idea.\n\nTEAM FORTRESS 2: Listen... There's a time in people's lives that you get this feeling that you want to relive the good times. Hell yeah this is what it leads to!\n\nHORROR MOVIES: Mainly slashers but if anyone knows Nightbreed, comics or otherwise, then I will love you forever.\n\nTRANSFORMERS: If it has the franchise name, I\u2019m up on that. I can play any continuity, the comics, G1, Beast Wars, Unicron Trilogy, Animated, Prime, hell I\u2019ll do that weird miniseries! Hit me up!",

            "selftext": " Hey there,\n\nI am looking to roleplay something in the universe, whether it be before SOTC or after The Last Guardian time frame. I would like to find a way to either find a way to explore the forbidden lands prior to their forbiddenness, after it was sealed through a future generation or after TLG to find and locate the futuristic tech that no one seems to understand how to use. If someone would like to have a cute little shipping between the two characters, I would love that. My character could be a horned girl from the village or we could try something that starts a whole bigger problem.\n\nOr, alternatively, we could start something that continues after Ico where they live in the village and perhaps my character is taken to be the sacrifice for the queen. I just want to roleplay in the world, and I know it's pretty uncommon to find a partner, but I'm sure we can work out something. I was thinking also that maybe our characters could figure out a new item from the \"old\" civilization that only works with the two of them? I feel there is stuff we can explore in the settings, and since I've almost finished the book: Ico: Castle in the Mist, I would probably take some of the elements from the village life.\n\nThe idea is that something big would happen, possibly to infect the smaller locations or a bigger one, and our characters are involved on some big level while either being in trouble or get involved in something. We could use multiple themes too!\n\nAs for a partner, I am searching for this:\n\n* **Adult partner, no children.**\n* **3rd person only.**\n* **Multi-Paragraph (Usually &gt;2, but quality over quantity.)**\n* **Be open to OOC talk**\n* **Respond fairly frequently, a few times a week.**\n* **I prefer 90% plot/10% NSFW.**\n* **I do want a romantic subplot.**\n* **Please, understand the universe I am trying to plot for.**",

Life is hard and people need time. However, if you do drop off for a few days, a simple notification would be wonderful. In addition to that, I am searching for someone more active. \n\nMy other major pet peeve is that I require at least a paragraph or so with each response. I've had way too many cases where I've written long, long started for the other person to write no more then a one liner...   \nNow that we have all that out of the way... to the plots and fandoms I write for! \n\n\\~Original plots\\~\n\nMafias daughter \n\nMy character is the daughter of the don of a major Mafia group. She herself is specialized as a hit man. Hired to kill anyone for the right amount of money.  Prehapes her next hit is you, or someone close to you. I wonder how you can convince her to not pull the trigger.   \n\n\nFantasy arranged marriage. \n\nMy character is due for an arrange marriage. She had never meet your character (or haven't seen them since they were a child.) On the day of the wedding, their ambushed by pirate/anything and taken hostage. Now, they have to work together to get back home.   \n\n\nSol: Greaser and Soc  \n\n\nMy character just moved in next door and bartends for a run down bar. I  know thats not much to go off of but I would love to see what kind of trouble our characters would get into. This one I would prefer a slow burn romance.   \n\n\nThose are the few I have. But if you have any ideas please feel free to toss them out! I would love to hear them! Also, the details in the prompts are not set in stone. Any aspect can be changed about them. \n\n\\~Fandoms I write for\\~\n\nThese are the fandoms I write for + my oc I have for them+ any characters I can play for shipping or romance purposes. If I write a romance/ship for you I ask that the favor be returned to me. Example: If I play  your OC X Cannon character all i ask is that you also play a cannon character for me as well. I hope that makes sense X.X\n\nFFXV  \nMy Hero Academia   \nDevil May Cry  \nMerlin  \nKingdom Hearts   \nHazbin Hotel  \nDetroit   \nMystic Messenger   \n\n\nPm for questions or interest \\^\\^ Thank you for your time\\~",

            "selftext": "Hiya.\n\nAs that blurb above, my main interest is in someone who holds to the same aesthetic and technical detail as I myself do, whether that be in use of prose and grammar or more relating to the world and the nations within it. To clarify, I enjoy a particular amount of detail when it comes to a universe: with the strong distaste I have for dry as marrow 'Dungeons and Dragons' worlds, I much rather prefer that the worlds be living and breathing things with the nations caked in history and culture and vibrant personalities that exist to give it blood and feel like an actual civilization that could exist realistically. They aren't just their self-contained little identities either: each identity and society would have evolved together and thus have drastically influenced each other's development, developing hatreds and sibling-like bonds between each other where, regardless of which, the necessity of (not exactly) state takes priority and ultimately all are looking out for themselves. Preferably, this would all take place within the scope of medieval favormongering politics: eight-hundreds to, at most, the fifteenth century in terms of technology. To be clear - I don't do AUs. Don't present me with your alternate history worlds that are edits to our own reality. I only do fantasy worlds, no alternative Earth material.\n\nFantastical races and supernatural/magical elements are a-okay with me as far as I'm concerned as, in my opinion, they give a chance for the world to put a spin on more conventional and realistic cultures and methods of administration by introducing non-human psychologies and biologies, making something alien and foreign for the MC to interact with (as well as other nations present.) This is, theoretically, including Tolkien-esq races such as dwarves, elves, orcs, all that, but, forewarning, that I have little to no respect for people who essentially just rebrand Tolkien's themes and ideas for races and paste them into their own, disrespecting him by so poorly conveying his meaning, and themselves for being a lighthearted plagiarist.\n\nQuite alright with the nitty and gritty. I dig a morbid universe that's dark and dreary and depressing as that essentially is the entire existence of the vast majority of the human population up until the industrial revolution which is a distance concept from now.\n\nWhere we write is of little consequence to me, but I do have a fondness for OC chatter on Discord, but it's not a requirement whatsoever. I personally discourage writing on Discord for the very obvious reasons of a text limit and it generally just being clunky with its formatting, but will acquiesce if requested.\n\nI play a number of OCs, many of which aren't women and all with their own diverse interests and opinions on things: bear in mind that I will choose a character that molds and fits into the world, not the other way around. I highly suggest not opening me with the question, 'Tell me about your character' before I know anything about the world and the content within it. I won't know until you share about yourself and the stories you're good at weaving and what the world you have to offer will, itself, have to offer.\n\nThat's about the length of it.

I can also play both canon and OC. Please note when it comes to romance I only do MxF in which I play M. \\[I do play genders of all kinds for secondary's, and I can hold several characters in a single reply.\\] I have a couple ideas in my head. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe biggest thing is I am only on season 2 after the sports contest arc. After we see the final fight. I won't post anything specifically spoiler-like in case anyone who's not up to that point is reading! Of course I can easily go beyond this arc with a little research. Not to mention I'm fast at catching up.  \n\n\nI use discord and email and have no preference between the two. My timezone is PST. \\[That's about 3 hours behind EST if that helps anyone!\\] I can do novella length but will match my partner. \\[Though sometimes I will write more just because I enjoy writing, I have no preference on your skill or length. Whether it's a single sentence of 20 paragraphs, it's all good to me!\\] I prefer to use third person since I like to play multiple characters. And depending on certain things, I am open to doubling if need be!  \n\n\nI am also open to hearing your ideas! And am alright with possible AUs. I hope to hear from you all soon!",

It was He who rose the ancient city from the ocean, established our government, and set us on the path to salvation. In Atlantis, we are not bound by what humans do on their lands. In Atlantis, we not only survive but thrive.\u201d\u2060\u2014 Liberty Medea\n\nThe year is 2020. The planet is dying. Unchecked human greed has driven many supernatural species to near extinction. The waters are too noisy for merfolk and selkies. Dryads and weres have less and less forest to call home. Supernaturals created from humans such as Banshees and Vampires suffer via human hunters who want nothing more than supernaturals to be extinct from the planet.\n\nThirty years ago, three supernaturals had a vision. Eos the light fae, Liberty the earth witch, and Bradford the shifter, founded a city by and for supernaturals. Eos the light fae used his magic to raise the sunken city of Atlantis from its depths and create a place that all supernatural creatures may live in harmony. This took all of his magic and his life. With his dying breath, he asked his friends to manage the city. Things started out well, but now the city is divided in two. The founders have each formed families of other supernaturals - \\*\\*\\*not based on species but loyalty\\*\\*\\*. Everyone who is anyone in the city is loyal to one family or another.\n\n* Para and Multi-Para styles welcome\n* Third Person, Past Tense\n* Long Term RP\n* Relaxed 7 day activity limit\n* OCs and multi-fandom characters welcome\n* 18+ mature rp\n* Engaging plot that you help shape\n* Helpful staff\n\n**OUR SOUND**[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1ObC4VNelniaj1TZeWdwzn?si=VZ7pQ6dDQ6KfB0X\\_tfYAtQ](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1ObC4VNelniaj1TZeWdwzn?si=VZ7pQ6dDQ6KfB0X_tfYAtQ)\n\n**OUR AESTHETIC**[https://www.pinterest.com/atlantiscityrpg](https://www.pinterest.com/atlantiscityrpg)\n\nAtlantis is a *brand new* rp.

I'd love to play in their last year of  Hogwarts and then head  into the First War, or even just start off with  their first forray into Order Missions. Ideally I'd like to balance the  fun of the Marauders with something more gritty and dark, and would  love to include some wolfstar cuteness.\n\nI  write 3rd  person past tense, with replies ranging from 3-9 paragraphs  depending on what's needed for the scene - I don't expect my partner to  match, so  long as you give me enough to work with \\^\\_\\^ I write canon x  canon characters only, please don't ask for OC's, but I am open to OOC discussions, and am happy to discuss any topics you  wish to avoid or include in the RP.\n\nWhat I'm looking for:\n\nCurrently  I am absolutely craving to play WOLFSTAR in the First War (1978+  onwards); I want something gritty, something with some good action and  angst mixed in with some good old Marauder mischief \ud83d\ude03 I'm open to  having multiple storylines with the war being the setting and other  plots interweaving that.\n\nI\u2019m  also willing to discuss Hogwarts RP providing it\u2019s set in their final  year, so they\u2019re 18+, but I\u2019d also like to find a cool over-arching plot  to work alongside the \u2018slice of life\u2019 Hogwarts format, as well as  including Wolfstar cuteness (crushes, confessions etc).\n\nSo   if you're interested in marauders playing pranks, some full moon   escapades and some angsty wizarding duels then please HMU with an intro in DMs :D",

Ever since Reach came out on PC I've been craving a Halo roleplay. I've played through all the games and have read a good majority of the books so I know a lot about the lore other than just the games themselevs. As for experience, I've been roleplaying for over 10 years now and use discord as my sole platform to roleplay on. I have several ideas about plot and characters. If you are interested at all in talking about more specifics feel free to PM me and I'll be more than happy to answer any questions you may have. Please only 18+, I don't feel comfortable roleplaying with anyone younger.",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone! Long time no see!\n\nI'm here with a quick search for some **My Hero Academia** AU roleplays! I'm caught up with the *anime only*, but I don't mind manga spoilers. I prefer **third person, paragraph form** over **Discord**, **canon** characters only. I'm not looking for OC'S right now, sorry!\n\nThe AU's I have in mind are as follows:\n\n* **Medieval/Fantasy**  \\- Could be based off the ending theme of the same style, or something new!\n* **Modern** \\- I love domestic life and ideas!\n* **Fallout** \\- Wanna feel **S.P.E.C.I.A.L** ? How about we go around the wasteland as MH characters as raiders, faction members, wanders, vault dwellers, ghouls and more?\n* **Battle Royale** \\- Big cast of character, plenty of opportunities to pit characters against each other!\n* **Vigilantes** \\- Being a Pro-Hero isn't all its racked up to be, so lets see some of the UA graduates take the law in their own hands! Who would stick together? Who would fight one another?\n* **Post Apocalypse/Zombies** \\- Nuclear fallout? Airborne? Classic bites and undead rising from the grave? Lets see whats in store for a small group of survivors trying to make it out alive! \n* **Historical/Historical horror** \\- Old mansions filled with secrets, a haunting in the streets of London, monsters waiting in the forest or a terrifying curse on a family name, whatever we have in mind!\n\n I'm not super picky about what characters or ships we play or how many, but I would love to focus on characters like **Iida, Yaoyorozu** and **Todoroki, Asui,** or **Ojiro,** but I don't mind focusing on more of the other Class-A kids, Pro-heros or villains as well, especially for a larger ensemble cast!\n\nPM or DM if you're interested! Thanks again!",

            "selftext": "\n\n\n\nHello, my name is Cj and I\u2019m Looking for some new partners most of them have ghosted me or have started to get busy.  Im a pretty experienced writer, I usually write a paragraph or two but I can write less and maybe more depending on how into the scene I am.\n\nAnyway I\u2019m usually up to rp with any kind of plot except extremely brutal plots like kidnapping and forcing a character to love an abuser I love darker plots but that gets too close to dark for me\n\nSome things I\u2019ve been into lately:\n\n\nThe Mandalorian \nOr anything to do with star wars\n\nCyberpunk stuff\n\n\nAnd a few more and I\u2019m extremely flexible with any kind of plots you have in mind\n\nConsidering lgbt+ your character can be a trans man or other masculine genders and any sexuality except straight( and lesbian but that\u2019s obvious ;7) since I\u2019ll be playing a man as well, sometimes I\u2019ll play as a trans man but ill ask you first if your comfortable with it. Variety is very good to have go all out with your characters make them unique~ \n\nSome basic rules I have:\n\nI can do first or third person but be warned if I do first person I might accidentally go into third person since I use that more, just be patient and ill get the hang of it.\n\nPlease tell me when you can\u2019t rp anymore I don\u2019t mind if you can\u2019t I just would like a verification,\n\nNo Nsfw immediately, the characters need to know each other first.\n\nNo one word replies, UNLESS there isn\u2019t much plot to do until we get another idea.\n\nPlease help with the plot I cant tell you how many times I\u2019ve had to keep a story flowing with a partner thats just there for the ride.\n \nPlease be 18 or older some of the plots can have more adult themes and I don\u2019t want to worry about anything.\n\nI use discord and nothing else its a comfort zone and it\u2019s fairly simple to use.\n\nThat\u2019s about it, if you have any questions please don\u2019t hesitate to ask and please send me a Message if you\u2019re interested I usually don\u2019t get notifications from comments. Have a good day!",

            "selftext": "OKAY, 3-2-1 LET'S JAM!\n\nHowdy there Space Cowboys and Cowgirls, hope everyone is having a great day today! Welcome, to my post! So, as you can read the title I have been craving for someone to do a Cowboy Bebop roleplay with me! I watched it back when I was a young boy and recently rewatched the series again and finally watched the movie! Good old nostalgia and good times! So, I am looking for a extremely passionate Cowboy Bebop fan like I am! My idea is to make the roleplay extend the universe of the world in Cowboy Bebop like how the creator of Cowboy Bebop (Shin'ichir\u00f4 Watanbe) did with his other animes (Space Dandy and Carole and Tuesday). In the roleplay it will be more of like a second part of Cowboy Bebop but will still have an orginal story with new characters that me and you will discuss and figure out. Also in the roleplay we will of course have a bit of the study of the original characters to see a \"Where are they now?\" type of thing, which I think will be really cool!\n\nSo, my good friend! If this does interest you then please read my requirments to make sure you are fit! \n\n~THE REQUIRMENTS~\n\n1. Must be a fan of Cowboy Bebop and have seen the entire series! \n\n2. Must be a detailed roleplayer! Semi Lit to Very Literate.\n\n3. Be fairly active online.\n\n4. Around my timezone, I am EST\n\n5. Also be around my age. I am 18, not a fan with roleplaying with someone who is younger. \n\n6. Must be able to roleplay Female and Male characters \n\n7. Must have ideas! I don't like being the only one making all the idea's! I want some creativity!\n\n~BONUS REQUIRMENTS~\nThese are requirments that are not that important but just ones that be awesome if you did fit these but if you didn't, then its cool!\n\n1. Seen the Cowboy Bebop movie!\n\n2. Seen the anime's Space Dandy &amp; Carole and Tuesday!\n\n3. Has the knowledge of the Shin'ichir\u00f4 Watanbe Cinematic Universe. \n\n\nWell guys, that's it for this post here! If you fit all the requirments and feel true passion about this roleplay! Then smack a lovely \"Hello\" in my PM's! But, if you are not interested then..............see ya space cowboy",

I'm a pretty busy student can't definitely commit to much more than that, so I won't ask that of you. Please try to communicate when you will be gone or significantly less active for several weeks or more. I will try to do the same.\n\nI'm a bit less lenient with this when we're still doing introductions, so if we've barely said hello but a few days pass and I hear nothing, I'll assume you're no longer interested or never were in the first place and close our discussion. You are free to assume the same of me. Somewhat along like this, I'd strongly prefer it if we could be quicker with laying down what we're going to do and starting to roleplay (as in within a day or two at the absolute max). Again, being slower once the roleplay starts is perfectly fine, preferred even, but I'm finding recently that the longer it takes to start, the less likely we'll start at all. Either my interest or yours will fizzle, you know?\n\n**\u2022Genre\u2022**\n\nI'm a sucker for Romantic Slice-of-life with a healthy dose of drama and angst, but I do like to weave other genres in there too such as Supernatural, Mystery, Action, and Adventure. I'm really open to most things if the plot interests me.\n\n**\u2022Gender and Romantic Preference\u2022**\n\nI strongly prefer playing a female main. Right now, I'm solely looking for MxF(me) as I do not have one at the moment. My apologies, but I don't double (at least not in our first roleplay together) as I've had past experiences where people continually keep their preferred couple(ie. the one in which I play male) in the limelight. \n\n I do not engage in dichotomy personality dynamics(you can ask what this means) and like pairings to be close to even as possible in contributions to the relationship. If a scene gets intimate, I'd prefer we fade to black until I become very comfortable roleplaying with you.\n\n**\u2022Plots/Creativity\u2022**\n\nThe plots I\u2019m looking to do at the moment are listed below. Despite this, you're more than welcome to share plots of your own. I'd prefer it if you are open to brainstorming plot points and bouncing ideas off each other too- let's keep this interesting for both of us so it stays alive.\n\n**\u2022OCs\u2022**\n\nI would prefer not to roleplay with OCs that are excessively shy, Mary-Sues, or OP. Additionally, please ensure your own OC does not monopolize the plot with their own issues and background. Let's share the spotlight. I tend to play multiple characters and would prefer if you did too.Please do not control my main OC or any named side characters I introduce. It can really mess with my plans with them if you suddenly auto-kill out of nowhere or something... If necessary, I may permit you to control a side character of mine, but please run it by me first. Communication is key.\n\n**\u2022Platform\u2022**\n\nDiscord is strongly preferred, but I can be convinced to use Kik, tumblr, or reddit.\n\n**\u2022Fandoms\u2022**\n\nI am willing to roleplay within the universe of several fandoms, but please note I do not roleplay as canon characters and would prefer not to roleplay with canon characters either. Please recall that I am more than happy to do original plots too if you aren't into any of these.\n\n\\-Corpse Party\\*\\*\n\n\\-Black Mirror\n\n\\-Death Note\n\n\\-Avatar The Last Airbender\\*\n\n\\-Downton Abbey\n\n\\-Call The Midwife\\*\n\n\\-Dragon Quest(IV-IX)\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\-Miraculous Ladybug\\*\\*\\*\\*(I'd love to delve into the more subtle, darker elements like the consequences of a broken miraculous and time travel)\n\n\\-Fruits Basket\\*\\*\n\n\\-Soul Eater\\*\n\n\\-The Hunger Games\n\n\\-Harry Potter\n\n(The number of \\* indicates craving)\n\n**\u2022Original Plots\u2022**\n\n(Muse I would like to play is bolded. If neither are bolded, I can do either. All of these are open to brainstorming and tweaking!)\n\n1. Muse A was born into a society where \u2018falling in love\u2019 is not a thing. Sure, it\u2019s written in about fairy tales and even history texts, but most Readers laugh it off as a silly, archaic concept. All couples are formed by reading Cerebral wavelengths, stats that are unique to every individual. Every person has a single match and are paired with that person permanently when they come of age. No trades, no take-backs. Muse B, though born into the regular world, doesn\u2019t believe in love either. Perhaps it was the plight of their parents, or that one nasty breakup. Perhaps it was the sight of all the couples around who\u2019d be lovey-dovey one week, but strangers the next. Whatever it is, they don\u2019t buy it. That suits Muse A just fine- their Cerebral wavelengths not only don\u2019t match, they bang together in a cacophony. Why is it then that these two begin experiencing an undeniable pull to each other?\n2. One night, **Muse A** is taking their usual jog through the park when they trip right over Muse B tying their shoe. Cliche start is cliche, I know, but stay with me here. After some initial awkwardness, the two hit it off quite well. Flash forward a week or so and the pair are starting school in the same class, **Muse A** as one of the typical debutants, and Muse B a lucky upstart on a basketball scholarship. Muse B had high hopes for where things\u2019ll go\u2026only to find out **Muse A** has a boyfriend, who happens to be Muse B\u2019s nemesis on the courts. Whoops. But something\u2019s really off with the couple. As in the boy is downright awful, and it isn\u2019t just the rivalry talking. Yet **Muse A** refuses to leave him\u2026why is that?\n3. (This is an older one of mine, but I\u2019ve recently kinda been in the mood to start it up again.) Marianoh\u2019s Culinary Institute is the most renowned school for culinary arts in the country. Any who truly wish to be a master chef would be foolish not to attend. Unless they don\u2019t have the means- the tuition is insanely high. **Muse A** is part of the lucky few of humble beginnings that has been selected to attend via scholarship. They couldn\u2019t be more excited. Muse B, on the other hand, comes from a family of celebrity chefs. Their spot at Marianoh\u2019s was confirmed before birth. Yet, somehow, they don\u2019t share **Muse A\u2019s** joy. Far from it, actually. What happens when the two are partnered up for the year?\n4. (A brand new one definitely open to suggestions) St. Cornelius\u2019 Academy(or University) is an academic institution reserved only for those of royal or noble background as well as their future servants, attendants, and body guards. Students of the academy hail from kingdoms where individuals are born gifted with control over the 8 elements- light, wind, flame, flora, lightening(tech), water, earth, and darkness. Students are divided based on status into \u2018Golds,\u2019 \u2018Greys,\u2019 and \u2018 The \u2018Gold\u2019 category includes all royalty and nobility aside from viscounts and barons of low birth. The \u2018Gray\u2019 category includes future ladies and men in waiting, other servants, attendants, and body guards. Students are instructed in all areas in order to best prepare them for their future roles from political science to etiquette to combat. Given the wealth of a portion of the student body, the campus is a vivacious display of luxury, featuring lavish gardens, seemingly endless grounds, state-of-the-art learning facilities, and even an expansive kitchen headed by a world renowned 31 star chef. Currently, I have three potential pairings in mind for this set-up.\n\n\\-**Muse A** is a new lady in waiting assigned to a spoilt, catty Duchess of Aquaria(Water Kingdom). Catering to the every whim of the young princess-to-be is exhausting, but her goal of reaching far greater heights than her questionable background merits keeps her going. What faster way to do that than catching the eye of Muse B, the princess\u2019 bethrothed and crown Prince of Aquaria using abilities bequeathed to her by her merpeople ancestry? The lines between acting and reality are prone to blurring, however and actual feelings soon begin to muddle her plans. Muse B isn\u2019t as unaware as he first seems either..\n\n\\-Muse A is the somewhat naive prince of Angion(Flora), unsure of his future. He\u2019s distant from his fianc\u00e9e, **Muse B** a cold, proud Marchioness of the same kingdom, and his closest confident is one of his newest body guards, **Muse C**. Little does he know, that **Muse C** has quite the secret- she\u2019s truly a girl whose taken on her brothers identity to serve. What will happen when all comes into the open?\n\n**Contact Instructions:** Please message me with the last song you listened to as well as a recent roleplaying sample.

I\u2019m a 22 year old female looking for anyone 18-29 that can play a male character whether you\u2019re actually male, female, non-binary, etc. it doesn\u2019t matter to me what you are in real life. I only roleplay on Discord and only do 1x1 roleplays. \n\nAll my plots are safe for work. I do NOT write smut. My roleplays typically focus on drama and romance with a hint of action depending on the role. I am pretty much advanced lit. Writing anywhere from a couple to multiple paragraphs. I only write in third person. Please be creative when messaging me if you\u2019re interested. All \u2018hi\u2019s and \u2018hey\u2019s will be ignored.\n\nI\u2019m also interested/have ideas in/for things such as Superheroes, witches, vampires, Vikings, and other things. Here\u2019s a whole list of roleplays I currently have plots for:\n\n*Band/Music* I have several different plots surrounding bands, musicians, etc. All are, of course, filled with lots of romance and drama. This showcases what it could be like behind the scenes of the music, the media and the scandals. \n\n*To All the Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before* follows the plot of the movie pretty much. A girl is being confronted by former crushes after word gets out about them. To avoid confrontation of another, she agrees to date one of them as it benefits both. Your character is using this to make his ex-girlfriend jealous and trying to possibly get her back. \n\n*Rivals* I have a few ideas for this one where we can create some sort of college rivalry plot. Our characters would be attending different universities yet somehow meet up and fall for each other. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a *what*?!\u201d: Those were the words that left his mouth and she would never be able to forgot them. My character had been dating this your character for a few months  now. At first it started super casual, never anything in the evening though, she was only ever free during the day. So most of the time it was usually meeting up early on the mornings, for lunch, or on a rare occasion past two or three in the morning.  My character had been trying to keep her job a secret from him for sometime now. He\u2019s got higher morals than her and she was never sure how he\u2019d react. \n\n*Fandoms* we can discuss Percy Jackson, Star Wars,Harry Potter, My Hero Academia(I\u2019m new to this one, just started it recently), etc. All fandoms are OCs, I don\u2019t do canon.",

            "selftext": "(My kik is WildMadiK)\n  You had saved me from thugs one stormy night and stayed with me till the ambulance came. Only you didn't leave my side. Something by how I clinged to you while we waited in the rain moved something in you. The sight wasnt pretty when ems showed up. Bodies of thugs strewn about, all groaning in pain, and you and me huddled behind a dumpster. The Emts immediately got me on to a gurney and lifted me out. My cries of pain werent good signs to them and so they asked you if you were with me. You said yes and climbed into the ambulance. After several excruciatingly long hours, the doctors managed to miraculously save my body from any real permenant damage. Though the good news was short, the road to healing was probably going to take the rest of my life while I would have to adjust to a life in a wheelchair. This is where you learned that I was effectively homeless. This is where you stepped in, you told the doctor that you would take me home and look after me. A few months later, you had us a house in a small village far from any major city. The house was built to accommodate my wheel chair but your job called you back to the field. So While you were saving the world, I was at home waiting for you. So While you snuck into secret facilities, I decorated the house. While you eliminated high value targets, I chatted with the neighbors and when you came home, i was there in my chair smiling. This our life.\n\n(Hello all, long story short, I want someone to play the Black Widow of the MCU while I play a woman she rescued. I want this to be a long term romance rp that evolves as time goes on. I had the idea from Hawkeye's family scene in the movies. Only thing different is that our relationship is a secret and hidden. You could say that I want the relationship to center around you trying to be normal and supportive while I help you relax after stressful missions. I hope this intrigues some of you and hope that me being a recovering paraplegic isnt too weird. For smut and romance, I would like a 25% to 75% split respectively but when it comes down it we can focus on the smut every so often. Drop a pic of Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow in your opening message to let me know you read this far. Hope to hear from you soon)",

I only write over email, mostly because I'm too thick to understand discord.\n\nAnwyay, I'd like the plot to be something revolving around romance, adventure, drama, medieval times, fantasy - but as you can see I have a lot of interests, so I'm really down for most things. Recently I've been thinking of writing a story around some clich\u00e9 themes - think of jealous boyfriends, forbidden romance, all that lovely stuff. I'd love to hear your ideas, too, so we can build something together!\n\nI write in third person, past tense, paragraph style. Reply length varies, but I'd say generally it's 2-5 paragraphs.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you!",

I have recently come back to roleplaying so I am trying to get a grasp on it again. I personally do enjoy creating an entire world surrounding the story you and me come up with. However, within certain already existing worlds I could roleplay in too. Genres I enjoy are the fantasty, post-apocalyptic settings etc. Slice of life really isn't my thing but don't be afraid to approach me with any form of question! Time era of the roleplay does not matter to me as I just enjoy the content we'd roleplay with!\n\nRomance could/should  be in play. We can build up from our two character to make them have something nice, although a dark turn would definitely interest me. I am not specifically looking to roleplay smut, but the occasional smutty interaction won't be a problem.\n\nCharacterwise, I come up with a new character that would be suitable for the world/genre we roleplay in. I only roleplay using OCs.\n\nI try to make sure my responses are good and up on the same level as the other person. I roleplay in third person.\n\nSo, If you are interested and have some ideas that you would like to pitch to me, don't be afraid to send me a DM. Please when contacting me make sure you are active and preferably 20+.",

The one thing that hasn't changed for me though and I always have time for, is my love of roleplaying and my love for pairing original characters with canons despite how much a lot of people hate that. Here's what I'm looking for:\n\n\\-18 or older writing partners  \n\\-Someone who can match my reply length (varies depending on the situation, I generally don't go over discords character limit which is about 3-4 paragraphs) and reply at least once or twice a day, or if you're only available on certain days, multiple times on those days  \n\\-Lots of OOC chatting! I don't want either of us to feel awkward or uncomfortable, i'd rather we were buds who can talk about stuff when we aren't screaming over our rp(s)  \n\\-Someone who is familiar with the character I'm looking for but isn't a complete and total stickler for following canon to a T\n\n**WHAT I WANT**\n\nI'm currently rewatching House MD and I am dying for someone to write Greg House alongside an original character of mine. I want to follow canon to some extent, with the relationship being a mix of slow burn and fire meets gasoline kinda deal. We can jump around, plot out new stuff, change canon, etc. I'm really flexible! Eventual plot/romance-driven intimacy is a must, but we can certainly fade to black.\n\n**WHAT I DON'T WANT**\n\nPlease don't come to me if you're looking to have House cheating on Cuddy with my character. I'm fine with exploring House's feelings for other characters in the show alongside his feelings for my character as they develop, but I'm not interested in playing 'the other woman' kind of deal.\n\n**CONTACT**\n\nI prefer to rp and chat over Discord, but I can do email as well as google doc. I have writing samples to provide and I'd appreciate it if you could do the same, to make sure we go well together in terms of writing style! We don't have to jump right into roleplaying either, in case you want to chat a bit first to make sure we'll get along.\n\nHope to hear from you soon!",

            "selftext": "Hey first just let me thank you for stopping by my post I really appreciate it :D (And I can\u2019t say this enough, but please read the entire post! I\u2019ve had some reply to my posts and say they didn\u2019t read it.) \n\nI\u2019m male and 20 and I just require you are around the same age (18+ to 22)in case of any NSFW related roleplays and because I would like to roleplay with someone around my age. If your slightly older than 22 I may be a bit flexible.)\n\nTo start off I was hoping to meet someone who is extremely open minded to most roleplays. I have a few ideas in mind too so if you\u2019d like to hear them that would be great! For the moment I have ideas focused around romance and the relationship between two characters. Keep in mind that the roleplay is your roleplay too so if we start to build an idea you can add or suggest anything you think would work and we can figure something out. \n\nLengths of repliesI would prefer to be detailed and not really short. If there\u2019s lots of dialogue I can understand if replies are shorter but I prefer that detail is used because to me I think detail is important, and detail adds to the story. If my replies aren\u2019t what you prefer please feel free to say that so I can improve and make them better for you and the roleplay itself. \n\nReply consistency for me can change because I totally understand that you may be busy or something like that and same for myself as well as I can get busy too, but I would prefer you were free for a decent amount of time so the roleplay gets going and doesn\u2019t just sit there not going far. Again that can totally change and I understand if you may not have all kinds of free time. We can always try and change around times a bit so it works better so no worries. \n\nLastly for the moment I only roleplay in PMs just because I currently don\u2019t use any other platform which I hope is alright. \n\nNote: If anyone had tried to message me if you were interested in my post and I didn\u2019t get back to you I apologize. My Reddit was really glitchy at one point and my DMs and Messages didn\u2019t work very well. \n\nThanks again for your time and if you are interested leave a reply or PM me :D",

            "selftext": "Now that I've, hopefully, got your attention, I'm looking to roleplay a post-apocalyptic romance. But not the dime-a-dozen zombie stuff. No, instead, our characters will have to deal with a world torn up by intense earthquakes following an EMP that had rendered all electronic devices useless. Our characters, after surviving the initial panic, face the terrain, the elements, the wildlife, and desperate fellow survivors. I want to explore the concepts of human tribalism, survivalism, depravity, and how love can blossom and survive in desperate situations. \n\nSince we'll be dealing with mature themes, I'm going to need you to be 18+. And because I would like for this roleplay to have the possibility to eventually deal with pregnancy, the main couple would have to be heterosexual, and I would play the male in the relationship. An average joe, not a professional hardcore survivalist. As for how the roleplay itself would start, I'm thinking our characters could be long-time friends on a camping trip or a roadtrip with other friends. Or perhaps our characters could be co-workers on a business trip when the EMP hits and the earthquakes start, leaving them stranded in a city they would likely need to escape. If you have another suggestion, do tell.\n\nFrom there, the love builds, as our couple depends on each other physically, mentally, and emotionally. Just two against the world... \n\nAs for about me as a roleplayer, I'm a literate to adv.literate who can give you a novella if you give me enough to work with! I'm 20, turning 21, and my timezone is Mountain Standard Time. And the mountains are fecking cold, let me tell ya.\n\nOh yeah, and my medium is Discord. Send me a message on here or comment if you're interested and we'll exchange tags.",

            "selftext": "Hello, r/Roleplay! I've been reading Kings of the Wyld and Bloody Rose by Nicholas Eames and it's given me a powerful urge to write something like it, but with a bit more romance involved! I came up with this idea and thought it might be fun to write with someone out there! I have limits that I'm perfectly happy to discuss via pm or over discord, rather than clog up my post with them here. Without further ado, here's the prompt.  \n\n\n*The shadow he cast was long, and not only due to his mighty height. He was one of the fiercest battlemages ever to be in a mercenary band, but for unknown reasons...the band broke up. Symphony was their name, and their accomplishments were a bard's dream. They toppled empires, broke sieges of monstrous hordes, fought in arenas for glory and gold. But, seemingly at the height of their fame, the band broke. Each disappeared into the pages of history...except one.*  \n\n\n*He was sighted, from time to time. Touring solo, occupying a shadowy corner of a tavern...even taking jobs as a laborer. They called him The Dragon. Was it for the long mane of sapphire blue hair? His emerald eyes, devoid of the inky void of pupils? Maybe it was for his prodigious control over flame. The truth was far more complicated, truth be told...but when is it not?*  \n\n\n*It was the height of winter when The Dragon appeared in a northern tavern called The Bunkhouse. His height was so great he had to duck his head to clear the door as he stamped the snow from his boots. His legendary double-headed hammer, Esther, hung at his waist. Those glittering emeralds in his eyes scanned the common room as he made for the bar, dropping a few coppers on the counter. \"Beer.\" he croaked in a voice strained from thirst. \"And stew.\" he paused, and after a moment he added, \"Please.\"*\n\n*Before the man could even sit he was swarmed by a dozen bards, their traditional red cloaks making the man look as though he was surrounded in a sea of bloody cloth. They asked him, as one, what he was there for. Was he touring? Did he have a contract? Was it dangerous? He took his beer, emptied the tankard in one gulp and spoke in a voice that carried through the tavern and brought it to silence. \"I'm holding auditions for Symphony's final song.\"*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope a person or two out there is interested! If you are, please include the phrase \"bardic gift\" somewhere in there! Thanks so much for your time! Hope to hear from you, soon!",

I've written to many of you to discuss interesting prompts I've seen, but this would be my first post for a plot of my own. \n\nRight now I dont have a compelte plot. I normally like to work on that with my partner and tailor things around our ideas. But the overall idea im looking for is to tell a heist story. I enjoy all different kinds of settings (Fantasy, Sci-fi, Modern, Supernatural) and like to include many different elements of romance, drama, action, and mystery in my RPs. \n\nI don't have a set limit for my writing. I tend to try and match my partners. I would consider myself semi-lit and flexible when it comes to my responses. If you're interested in creating a Heist story together hopefully we can talk soon.",

If you do send me a Chat Request &gt; PM, replies can be scarce and even not existent. So again, please PM. c:\n\nHi there! Thanks for taking a look at my advertisement!\n\nMy name's Kyle, I'm 20, English and I'm currently looking for some RP partners to write some cool and original stories! Before I say about what I like to roleplay, allow me to introduce myself and my likes.\n\n\u2022 I'm currently 20, so I'm looking for someone 18+. This is mainly due to the fact that my RPs can NSFW in parts and I just wanna make sure no trouble comes of it.\n\n\u2022 I'm currently only looking for FEMALE RP Partners. I do apologize if this offends anyone of the male/trans community. Its just my personal preference. I'd also ask that you're fairly active too. A couple of posts a day at least.\n\n\u2022 I like a partner who's detailed and experienced. Fine, quickfire posts can be shorter, but I like quality in my posts. I'm not asking for half a novel though. There's such a thing as too little and too much detail. Also, I RP in THIRD person only. Again, just my preference, however, I am more than welcome for you to use third/first at your own desire. I also play OC Characters only as well. I don't find it entertaining to play a Canon Character. I don't mind them appearing as side characters but the main story players will be OC x OC.\n\n\u2022 Finally, I like people who are interested in the same things as myself. Please understand what my RP is being based on. I offer a variety of scenarios so there's plenty to choose from. But PLEASE have played through RDR2 to completion at least. You don't need to know the stories off by heart but extensive knowledge would help greatly.\n\nRight! Now I have my expectations out of the way, here are the things I'm looking for RP story-wise!  \n\\-------------------------------------------\n\n* RDR - This is basically what's on the box. I would like to do an RP that focuses on two OC characters injected into the story of RDR2, starting with the gang already heading towards Horseshoe Overlook (so basically, right at the prologue). You can introduce your character however you like, but my character will be introduced as already being part of the Van Der Lindes Gang. Specifics as to how he's there already will be discussed through exposition in the RP. I wanna do a romance as well between our characters, whether we start that from fresh or have it already established in the beginning is entirely up to you.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------\n\nI hope you all enjoyed what I've produced and I hope that I get some responses fairly soon! Thanks again for taking the time to read my post! See you soon!",

Why couldn\u2019t she be a part of one? She wanted someone to cuddle up with her at night and reassure her when she had nightmares...\n\nBut alas. Empresses could not have the luxury. She was doomed to hide her penchants of love in a stoic shell, for all of eternity. No one dared try to court her, she was all too intimidating. All she wanted to do was hug them when they stuttered, saying that they were doing a good job, but she couldn\u2019t. She withered away as she dismissed them. And no one even blamed her for it!

It can be set in DC, New Vegas or somewhere else though I\u2019m honestly not the biggest fan of Boston because of my own feelings about the game Fallout 4 itself. That mini-tangent aside, I\u2019m mainly looking to do an original story set in the fallout universe with our (hopefully) original characters having their own interesting backstories and yadda yadda yadda. As for romance, I\u2019m down for it to develop between our characters and and completely comfortable writing it, I only hope you are. But if this sounds like something you\u2019d be interested in, hit me up with a character or a story idea and we\u2019ll get to planning.",

            "selftext": "***Note:*** I'm looking for 2 different rp's with this one :) Vampire x vampire hunter, and Vampire Academy, based either at the academy or after (for VA rp, the youngest I'll play is 18, obviously).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHi all. I've posted here quite a few times before, and I've found a small handful of really great partners, most of which have since ghosted me. It's trial and error. Anyways, my name is Jess, I'm 25, and I have 15+ years of writing experience. I write only 3rd person, past tense, and expect my partner to do the same. And please don't be intimidated by my experience. I do request a sample for all my potential partners, so please send one with your first PM. I won't exchange discords until I agree to be your partner. Here is a sample of my writing.\n\n&gt;Elle frowned slightly as she stared out at the road ahead. There were many things about her past that troubled her, but all of them were worth talking about. She told Carver this, saying, \"Nothing. I think the past is important to discuss. After all... if we forget who we used to be...\" She trailed off, swallowing the lump that had risen in her throat.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"Hawk... I need you to know...\" she paused, pulling her hand back from his and gripping the steering wheel tightly. \"I used to be a monster. The first decade of my immortal life, I rampaged across Europe. With Thomas.\" Elle could not look at him; she stared straight ahead, up towards the light they had stopped at. With the engine idling now, the silence was oppressive.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"He taught me to be cruel, and deceitful and - and... insatiable.\" Elle sighed heavily, clenching her jaw. \"I left him, in a moment of... lucidity. I found the coven not long thereafter. They helped me change my ways. They are the reason I am who I am today.\" The light had turned green, and a car behind her honked it's horn irritably. She flinched at the sound and sped off, the wheels screeching in protest. Up ahead, the little diner she had mentioned came into view, and she pulled into the parking lot.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Parking the car, she glanced to Hawk, nervous. \"Those are the skeletons in my closet. I understand if it's... well, too much. If you want to back out of our deal... and... and us.\"\n\nAnyways, I'm looking for some partners who are literate (3 paragraphs minimum with good grammar, spelling, etc.), I am also looking for someone who is comfortable with explicit NSFW themes, and not just romance.\n\nWith that all out of the way, here's some plot info I am looking for! I enjoy romance, angst, conflict, and well-rounded characters. I'm not looking for a Jane or John Doe - give your characters some *depth*. I am open to FxF and FxM, and I will always play a female character. I'm very big on organic relationships, though, and I absolutely will not force my character(s) into anything that doesn't feel natural to me.\n\nFor ***Vampire Academy*** I will be playing a female dhampir named Astrid Skarde - her age will range anywhere from 18 to 28, and like my note says above, it can be set in or after the academy. We can do AU, post-Last Sacrifice, or run our story alongside the books.\n\nAs far as plot goes for the ***vampire x hunter idea***, I'd prefer we come up with one together. This will be a modern rp. The main character I will be playing is Eleanor Wilson (though more may come up with time) - born in England (she's got a sexy accent :P) in the year 1707, she currently lives in America (we can discuss specific locations). Reclusive, Eleanor (aka Elle) shies away from relationships, as her past has taught her that caring only ends up causing her grief. She is forever on the run from her Maker and ex-mate, Thomas, who killed the Coven that took her in after she left Thomas. She is a chaotic-good on the morality spectrum. A common secondary character that I play is Thomas Laurent, hailing from France; he is Eleanor's Maker and ex-mate. His exact age is unknown, but he is at least 350 years old, and his reputation is that of an ancient-killer; he murdered Elle's previous coven, and now seeks to hunt her down, as well. He's probably a lawful-evil or lawful-neutral.\n\nI'm looking for my partner to play a vampire hunter - a mortal who possesses better resilience than other mortals, and who may have a few special powers that help them track and hunt vampires. As for the vampires themselves, I take a lot from the game Vampyr. They don't burn in the sun, but fire is their enemy, and silver is, too. They cannot feed on animals, because animals don't nourish them enough. They cannot take only a little blood from people (their bite is lethal 100% of the time, at least for normal mortals). My vampires also have certain abilities - each bloodline is unique. For Elle's line (which, as far as Elle knows, only contains her and Thomas, though Thomas may have Sired other immortals), they have control over blood. Think of it like blood bending from Avatar TLA. They can control the blood in people's bodies, as well as their own, and can use it to create weaponry made of blood, shields made of blood, and they can pool their blood into a shadow-like attack from below. If you know about the abilities from the game Vampyr, you'll know what I'm talking about. One important note to make is that *I do not powerplay or god-mode*. Neither Elle nor Thomas are invincible, they are just very strong due to their ancient lineage. I will not control your characters, but if Elle or Thomas would blood bend/attack yours, I will ask you first, and we can see what works.\n\nI think this is all the necessary info needed! I do like to use pictures for my characters, and I like to have servers to keep things neat!",
