            "selftext": "**Intro\u2014**\n\nMaybe the real pandemic was the friends we made along the way! \n\n**This request got updated again 3/26!** The requested genres for Star Wars are: **The Old Republic**, **The Clone Wars, The Mandalorian, and The Sequels**. I'm a lifelong Star Wars fan that's been collecting writing partners to have Star Wars fun. Especially now that I\u2019m forced home for Corona Doomsday. I\u2019m pretty particular with partners so please read the whole request as some *genres have specific requirements*. \n\nThis would be 1x1 on Discord and hopefully go on longer than Corona Doomsday. I'd like to find someone relatively like me who just really loves Star Wars and its setting and characters. One of the most important things I\u2019m looking for is **no** **negativity**. There are plenty of other subreddits out there to complain about Star Wars and drown yourself in discourse. I loved the Last Jedi, I loved the Rise of Skywalker (even though it shattered my heart into little pieces), and really there's never been a media of Star Wars I've hated. Even the prequels were fun! If we add each other and the first thing a partner talks about it how they were annoyed by this or that, I lose interest almost immediately. Discourse just isn't my thing.\n\n**About Me--**\n\nI\u2019m a city girl in my late 20s and my passion in life is writing (I\u2019m a NaNoWriMo 2019 winner!). I\u2019m on CST time and tend to always be around to some extent on Discord. I play primarily female characters. I can NPC male characters easily I just prefer focusing on my female characters. I don't double as I feel strongly that it completely destroys the point of roleplaying as a hobby. I enjoy all aspects of fiction themes: adventure, drama, romance, family, angst, humor--so I would feel like I was missing out if any was left out of writing. I also find the gatekeeping of quality writing not involving romance silly. Though in regards to that I only write FxF or FxM. I am open to all ratings of content but I'm fine if a partner doesn't want to. \n\nI don\u2019t like to take any of this too seriously. I do this for fun!\n\n**What I'm Looking For--**\n\nOf course, I'm looking for Star Wars RP. But I'm looking for certain scenarios in the following time periods. Also as I want to play some canons for the majority of these genres, I would also like a partner that would also be interested in canons. Not to say no originals (some of them would probably involve a nice handful of originals tbh), just some of both type. I'm not really into the \"I never play canons\" or \"I never play originals\". Variety is the spice of life.\n\n***To repeat: if you message me saying \u201cI don\u2019t play canons but OCs are something something something\u201d then you\u2019re not what I\u2019m looking for.***\n\n***The Old Republic***: **ONLY LOOKING FOR FEMALE WRITING PARTNERS FOR TOR.** I've played a lot of SWTOR (and still do) and it's a fun era with a huge amount of setting. I think it'd be fun to either create or combine some crews from SWTOR. There were just a lot of really interesting characters involved in the game. For example, the Jedi Knight and the Barsen'Thor joining forces! That sounds cool! But, again, only looking for female writing partners for this genre. And as I primarily write female characters, any romantic entanglements would be either FxF or FxM. But I'm also a huge fan of family plots and ride or die friend plots. \n\n***The Clone Wars***: As like many others, the new season of TCW has me feeling it again. Did y'all hear the news about Ahsoka?! I\u2019d love to find a partner that I could come up with some fun adventures with. But to first make something clear\u2014I\u2019m just not interested in MasterxPadawan romances. I don\u2019t know, it just doesn\u2019t appeal to me. But aside from that, I think it\u2019d be a lot of fun to be able to work with all those canon characters and also to mix a few originals into the mix. Maybe put together a strike team or something. Also, I really want to actually involve some clones. The whole focus being on Jedi doesn\u2019t interest me as much. Though I\u2019m actually thinking I might be interested in playing Trilla as a Padawan.  I think I would prefer starting out with plays canons with this and then as I get used to a partner, we try to branch out more into originals then. Prove your groove, I guess?\n\n***The Mandalorian***: The Mandalorian is, like, the greatest show known to man (DID YOU HEAR THE NEWS?!?!). It's actually the best. It also has my favorite theme--found family! I like how Din so obviously wants friends and a crew but nobody wants to hang out with him. Only Baby Yoda likes him. So it's something I sort of want to take into a Firefly-esque direction. With him putting together a small crew (with myself and my partner putting together a couple of originals) and them all just having space western adventures. If anyone is interested in writing Mr. Din himself...  that would be the thing I'm going for! Which could involve canon characters from that time period if we so desired (I'm just saying Rogue One isn't that far off time-wise) and just have fun. I already have a concept for a medical character--but there's a ton of other types that can be used for this western-style adventure of the week sort of setting. Plus, I really love explosions so we could totally have explosions.\n\n***The Sequels:*** I'm making this one muuuuch shorter because I've done a lot of varying sequel stuff.  Mostly Reylo so far. Because I really love Reylo. But basically, I just love Rey a lot. She's my space raccoon hobo hero. But I don't have anything in mind at the moment, so this is mostly a callout of: **HEY, DO YOU NEED A REY**? If so, send me the plot idea. I'm down to see if it's something I'd be down with writing. Though I'm really only looking to work her with other canons, just not feeling throwing her in with a bunch of originals. I just don't have any specific plot ideas for a storyline at the moment so I'd figure I'd see if anyone wants some plots with her. I'm pretty open to exploring whatever with her.\n\n**Partner Requirements--**\n\n* 21 or older.\n* No gender requirement (except for TOR) but I have a preference for writing with other women.\n* Discord as a platform (we'll use servers!).\n* 1x1 focused.\n* Paragraph, literate style. I just really like writing and the depth of writing. So single sentence roleplaying just doesn't really jive with me. **Third-person only.** \n* Availability and some extent of accountability. I'd like someone that can regularly write with me. I, of course, have a life of my own and won't always be around or feel like chatting/writing. I\u2019d just like at least once a week.  At the moment I'm hoping for something a bit quicker than that even because of all the Corona free time but I wouldn't expect anyone to maintain that when things get back to normal.\n* Someone who wants regular OOC chatting. Firstly, I just like being able to chat and be friends with my partner. Secondly, it makes me feel comfortable suggesting plots. Thirdly, in all honesty, I don't tend to prioritize writing replies to people I don't talk to much. I'll always put the ones who chat with me regularly first.\n* If you're not feeling it, please just tell me. I promise I'm chiller than I seem.\n\n**In Conclusion--**\n\nThank you for reading my wordy request! If you're interested in reaching out to me, please DM and don't comment. I will emphasize this...\n\n***If you're going to DM me please tell me which time period you're interested in, if there are particular characters you're interested in, your time zone, and what you're comfortable/not comfortable with writing. It helps me organize!***\n\nPSA: Wash your hands, don't touch your face, stay home!",

Anyways, as the title says, I\u2019m looking for a partner to do an Attack On Titan roleplay with! I can match any level of description that you might put out, but I\u2019d hope that you\u2019d at least put in some effort and give me detailed and descriptive responses, because that shows me that you are really enjoying the Roleplay.\n\nNow, onto specifics. I\u2019m fine if you choose to play as an OC or a canon character, I myself will be playing as an OC, and if necessary, I can control some other characters too!\n\nWhat I mainly want is for this Roleplay to be similar to the Attack on Titan 2 game, in which essentially the OC is thrust into the main plot as an additional character. It will not follow that OC\u2019s story and character development exactly, seeing as I\u2019ve got my own ideas, but that\u2019s the gist of the idea! I\u2019d love to hear any prompts that you may have yourself, so don\u2019t feel shy when messaging me!\n\nJust know that I\u2019m fully aware of the Manga plot, so don\u2019t feel the need to shy away from spoilers, I know my stuff. We can discuss things in much further detail as you message me, so don\u2019t hesitate, ill always be open for this! Just shoot me a PM and we can get started!

But I can be flexible and use Reddit pms.\n\nI typically prefer to play in third person since it\u2019s more comfortable and easier to get into character but I can do first as well, the choice is up to you. I\u2019m mostly literate and prefer semi lit to lit rpers. One lines are boring.\n\nI do have a few plots in mind that I would like to try. Most of plots that I have in mind do lead to some form of romance that develops between the two. But if you have any ideas, please share with me. \n\nI am more of a story driver player, so if your interest is JUST romance, there needs to be a build up. I do not want to base the Roleplay around a constant smut story.\n\nI am interested in any kind of genre; sci-fi, dark themes, fantasy, cheesy \u201cnext door neighbour\u201d romance, Dystopian, etc. And I can play any gender, of any pairing, fxf, mxm, fxm.\n\nThanks for reading if you\u2019ve taken interest in my post.

            "selftext": "Hey there. I'm looking for someone to create an amazing, gripping story with.. especially during Quarantine! The main theme I like to play is romance but we can also add different elements into it if you wish. Please note though, fantasy is a big no! I would really appreciate it if you were reliable, and tell me if it got boring because then it's fair. If you ghost me, don\u2019t expect a sudden second chance. Of course we will both have our own personal lives but I\u2019ll always communicate healthily and let you know when I\u2019m busy. If you're going to message, be serious about this too and have a clear idea about what you want. I can do first or third person, I can change my preference if needs to be. \n\nHonestly, I will NOT accept one liners nor will I respond back to you if you're just gonna ghost. I've had enough of people just coming along for short-term purposes when this is LONG term. I cannot stress that enough. I\u2019m not putting in the effort if you don\u2019t. \n\nMy list:\n\n\\~Friends from childhood.\n\n\\~Roommates.\n\n\\~Nurse and Solider/veteran.\n\n\\~Prince/Princess falls for a village girl/boy.\n\n\\~Friends with benefits.\n\n\\~Rich Entrepreneur and interior designer.\n\n\\~Gang member and innocent girl.\n\n\\~Strangers.\n\nAnd of course, any other ideas you wish to tell me about. Yes I know these are mildly clich\u00e8, so I\u2019m willing to spice them up and add a lot more angst, or even some dark themes if it does fit with the idea. \n\nSmut will have a element in this, but it won't be too overpowering as I want to enjoy the story at its fullest - so it will be discussed fully once the plot has been established and there will always be a good build-up before any NSFW. When it happens though, I'll make sure to attend to your every need. I cannot stress this enough; Please be literate! (more than a paragraph at least). If you deliver on that, I will too. Roleplay is a two way mutual thing and it has to flow in order to keep a story going. \n\nThanks for reading! I use Reddit and kik. If you have any other platform, I\u2019ll be sure to download it if I can but I really do prefer the two I\u2019ve mentioned.",

I have a small group(3-4) of other people I RP and game with in a private discord group and would be looking for a friendly and understanding person to potentially join if they feel comfortable with that. Otherwise, just RP is fine too.   \n\n\nI'm looking for someone who is 18 or older and semi-literate to literate with their posts. Creative with good grammar and open to trying different things. Ultimately, I would like to do fxf or mxm but am willing to fxm if the RP evolves naturally that way. The fandoms I tend to RP are(with OCs only): Red Dead 2, GTA V, Destiny 2, Fallout, Skyrim. I would be interested in doing original ideas, but if that is the case I would prefer to have a fairly seamless world that we make together, I feel like sometimes it can be annoying to make up worlds and I don't particularly like to do that.   \n\n\nIf you'd like to contact me, please comment down below or DM and we can exchange discords.",

I\u2019m 20 years old, I\u2019ve been role playing for a little while, and would prefer someone who\u2019s able to answer a few times a day.\n\nThe general plot is, we\u2019ve been roommates for a year and a half. You\u2019re a guy who\u2019s family has been asking him to come home for the holidays. They\u2019ve hounded you about getting a boyfriend, so you told them I was your boyfriend. Now you want me to go with you to meet your family.\n\nI\u2019d like the role play to include some humour, some teasing, some drama and eventually some romance.\nI tend to play more reserved, proper, halfway between extravert and introvert characters that doesn\u2019t like to be in the spotlight but Is capable.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in discussing this idea, send me a message. I like using discord.",

What I'm specifically searching for is a long-term rp with one of you lovely people! Fantasy is definitely my favorite genre, be it of the traditional sort or more modern, but I'm more than game for other genres too, such as sci-fi and many others. Unfortunately, I don't do fandom roleplays.\n\nI already have a few ideas, but I'd love to hear yours as well so we can create something that's fun for both of us! Please don't hesitate messaging me if your interest is piqued even a little, I promise I won't bite. \nAlso, I have a ton of OCs that can be used for many different kinds of roleplays, so I'm definitely flexible. \n\nOh and also also! I'm additionally on the search for a GM for an rp idea that I have that includes werewolves. If that's what you enjoy doing, I'd love to chat more with you! \n\nI can write in both first and third person, so feel free to take your pick. As for the length of posts, I aim to match my partner's post length, but I usually write at least a paragraph or two depending on the scene. Just have decent grammar, okay? I don't mind small errors and typos at all, those happen to everyone.\n\nI roleplay either on Discord or Kik, though Discord is the preferred platform. \nYou can message me if you have ANY questions, or if this post got you interested!\n\nCheers!",

Anyways, as the title says, I\u2019m looking for a partner to do an Attack On Titan roleplay with! I can match any level of description that you might put out, but I\u2019d hope that you\u2019d at least put in some effort and give me detailed and descriptive responses, because that shows me that you are really enjoying the Roleplay.\n\nNow, onto specifics. I\u2019m fine if you choose to play as an OC or a canon character, I myself will be playing as an OC, and if necessary, I can control some other characters too!\n\nWhat I mainly want is for this Roleplay to be similar to the Attack on Titan 2 game, in which essentially the OC is thrust into the main plot as an additional character. It will not follow that OC\u2019s story and character development exactly, seeing as I\u2019ve got my own ideas, but that\u2019s the gist of the idea! I\u2019d love to hear any prompts that you may have yourself, so don\u2019t feel shy when messaging me!\n\nJust know that I\u2019m fully aware of the Manga plot, so don\u2019t feel the need to shy away from spoilers, I know my stuff. We can discuss things in much further detail as you message me, so don\u2019t hesitate, ill always be open for this! Just shoot me a PM and we can get started!

I hope everyone is staying as close to sane as possible and if you\u2019re struggling, I urge you to join me in some good old fashioned escapism. \n\nI\u2019ve been roleplaying for years now but haven\u2019t posted on Reddit for a little while. I\u2019m really open to any scenarios or ideas so drop me a line even if the ideas below aren\u2019t quite what you\u2019re interested in. But I\u2019m gonna list some of my ideas or precious roleplays. I am a bit of a sucker for the unlikely pairing situation, the bounty hunter and the nobles daughter. \nThe street urchin and the princess. Anything where two different characters can play off each others strengths and weaknesses. \n\nI love world building and will happily play GM. \n\nPreviously I\u2019ve done some really wonderful roleplays revolving around a semi fantastical Edo period Japan. In which a sell sword and a woman set off on a quest across the country either in search of treasure or revenge. \n\nI\u2019m also pretty interested in a post apocalyptic setting especially since the whole pandemic thing has made that a little more real. \n\nReally if you read my history you\u2019ll see some ideas or if you have some of your own just hit me up and let me know. \n\nI\u2019m mostly into long term, slow burning roleplays.

            "selftext": "Hi, I'm looking for possible help with a HxH RP on discord, as the Rp Community lacks one and is being filled with Demon Slayer RP's. I currently have no lore in place as of yet though it'd be wonderful if I could possibly get some help with everything, as I'm the sole person working on it at the moment. This is an AU RP as well, and will not contain canon characters or Hatsu's. I'm looking for people who can just be active and help out with creating systems and lore, and other aspects that are important to the RP. ANY help is appreciated. Thank you for reading this and have a lovely day.   \n\n\n(P.S Here's the Discord Link: [https://discord.gg/YVk2xZn](https://discord.gg/YVk2xZn))",

It is a glimmering symbol of power a riches with machines and dragons soaring across the sky. However, not everything is what it seems. With poverty striking the majority of the population and a king who could care less about those without the coin, whispers mention a revolution that could be brewing among the ones suffering under the tyrannical rule. Whether this be true or not, is something only you can find out.\n\nEgostin is a steampunk inspired, 18+, LGBTQ+ friendly community with helpful staff and an immersive story that require literary format replies. You can play as a human within three separate tiers (ground, mid, sky) and choose among our extensive list of roles and jobs. With our heavy lore and large community, you will have no issue immersing yourself into the story and digging into the mystery that is Egostin. There is much to discover and much to unfold. Hope to see you here and message me if you're interested! If you have any questions, don't be afraid to ask! Long live the king!",

            "selftext": " I've   been role playing for a long time. I play on discord after years of   writing on forums. I enjoy the one on one stories. I use Discord       exclusively and write in 3rd person. I'm not a perfectionist and I        don't expect a novel from you. I tend to write 2 or three small   paragraphs but honestly it's quality over quantity. Give me something to   reply   to.\n\nNow  that  that's  out  of the way... I love plotting ooc and all of that. I like   to   build a  world   and play side characters to make the world  seem  fuller. I like  to use   pictures and music. I'd ask that the   pictures   you use to  represent   your character be real people. I'm   not   really a  fan of    Anime.\n\nOk    onto  ideas. I  have a   few  prompts but I'll list genres I'm into   too.     If  my ad   catches your  fancy  but you don't mesh with my   ideas I'm    happy   to   plot out something  else.\n\nWWII:   There's a bunch of things we could do here. I have a few character  ideas  ready to go. I was figuring your character would be the girl back  home  or maybe a nurse he meets out on the front lines. Heck even a USO  girl.\n\nFUTURE:  I was thinking  something along the lines of Blade Runner. Most of the  old world has  fallen. There are cities where the new world thrives but  there are  large sections of the world that are deserted either due to  destruction  from a past war or natural disaster. I'm open to all sorts  of ideas,  let's plot something out together.\n\n1984:   My character is a rising rock star in the Glam scene. Drugs and rock   and roll. We can talk about where we want to take this. Is she a fan?   Maybe she's a journalist or even a friend from back home.\n\nWIZARDING   WORLD: I'm not a Harry Potter expert but I read all of the books and   watched all of the movies. We can either use that world or make our own.   I like the whole idea of humans not knowing about the wizarding world.\n\nPIRATE: A notorious pirate in the caribean. He's a dashing rogue but has a code he lives by. Kind of like Robin Hood on the 7 seas. There's a bunch of options we could do here. The governor's daughter, a rival pirate, mermaid etc. If you have an idea let me know.\n\nDC: I'v been obsessed with Starfire lately after watching Teen Titans. I had an idea involving Batman and Star. It's not your usual pairing but I don't think I could pull Robin off.  \n\n\nMUMMY: My guy is an archeologist exploring an ancient tomb in Egypt. He finds a sarcophagus and against all warning from his colleagues he sneaks in at night opening it to see for himself. Inside is a perfectly preserved queen restored and awakened in the modern era.   \n\n\nTIME TRAVELER: A graduate of MIT has a theory. The only problem is everyone thinks he's crazy. He spends his time working on his device. A smart watch that allows him to bend space and time. The only problem is that it shorts out on the trip there so he's stuck til he can fix it. We can do pretty much any time period. I think we could have fun with this one.  \n\n\nWEIRD SCIENCE: A recluse geek who has seen a movie way too many times looks up a vadun ritual he doesn't think it will work but it's worth a shot right? It does work! He creates a completly sentient lifeform albeit one who hasn't experienced much and is kinda naive.\n\nGENRES I'M INTO: LORD OF THE RINGS, D&amp;D, Stranger things, Star Wars, Marvel, MCU, Star Trek.",

            "selftext": "The Redoubt. A small coffee shop in a corner of a city called Makah. A city located right on the coast of the Lucian Strait and under Mount Shaw. Down the street was the Strait, and looking up out the high skylight facing South, you could see the top of Mount Shaw. \nThe door was old and covered in black paint, brassed fittings on it seemed to match the old brick building. Above it was a sign, wooden and hanging there with a light on above it to make it seen during operation hours. It said the shops name in gold lettering. Makah in the Washington, across the Sound from Seattle. Makah was established years before as a Port for supplies to reach settlers. It was established on the land once inhabited by the Makah Tride. For who the city was named after, and many locals can trace roots to that tribe. There are even pure blooded ones still in the city, and the Tribe is now a organization. \nRedoubt was a strange coffee shop, the inside was one long wooden bar, a hundred years old and made of shined and polished Seqouia Redwood. It was old, but the craftsmanship and the love put into it still shone though. On the inside were paintings, the walls were a cozy green with gold trimming. The back of the bar was filled with coffee making apperatus. There were shelves with Indian art, old objects from city history. Tabels lined the windows that looked out into the streets. The whole cafe was warm and bright. \n\nBehind the bar was the owner and only worker. Ansel. He was a younger man, and he walked with a limp. He wore a grey shirt, blue pants and black shoes. His hair was wild and light brown, his eyes as grey as the skies above the city. He had, though, the purest and most happy smile amoung any ever seen. The Redoubt was his, and he only opened at 10 P.M. and he closed when he liked. He lived above the shop in the apartment. \nHe smiled as he flicked the lights on, illuminated the sign and started the machines. Unlocking the door, and waiting\n\n// Sooo what I\u2019m looking for. \nOne: Hello! Hi, thanks for looking through this strange idea I had, I really hope you decide to drop me a line! I won\u2019t be to busy being locked away in my house so I have plenty of time to rp! \nOkay, now to the main idea. Do you have OCs? Cool! I wanna hear them, in my shop. So the idea was that you could bring any characters you want, and let them kinda inhabit the coffee shop. Couples, singles. Maybe someone who\u2019s never gone into the shop before and maybe their a regular. I wanna make a story through this little coffee shop open after dark. It\u2019s a strange idea, but I kinda like it.\nSo what will happen? Well, Ansel (my OC) will be the only barista. He\u2019ll serve Y/C\u2019s drinks, and talk. And we\u2019re see what happens. I wanna keep a kinda chill atmosphere. Bring anyone by the way! I was thinking this is a Earth that has anything, so werewolves and vampires. Elves and such. Anything\u2019s cool. But keep it kinda grounded, these are meant to be actual people. Coming down for a cup of coffee, or whatever. People with lives who forever what reason come to visit the Redoubt. Variety is the spice of life! But keep it kinda realistic, so no swooping in and acting like some kind mega demon lord come straight from hell. That\u2019s.. just boring. Realistic people (even if they aren\u2019t strictly people) with backgrounds and issues are cool to me! \nPossible romance is cool! I\u2019ll be adding a handful of my own OCs so don\u2019t think you will need to control a massive amount of characters. If you wanna only play one or two OCs at a time that\u2019s fine (and kinda preferred) I do ask you play more then one character though. \nFor me personally I have no limits, all my characters are dominant bisexuals, male leaning. So bring boys and girls if your looking for something other then some talk. But really I wanna focus just on the shop and stories and people therein. \nIf you have played the game Coffee Talk that is what I\u2019m heavily basing this off of. \n\nOkay! So, message me if you have any questions or wanna rp! I rp on Discord or Kik, never Reddit chat. Hope to hear from you soon!!!",

The manor is the threshold of the empire, where Emperor Iarran the Impure conducts his duties. He rules as an absolute dictator, with a standing army at his command, and the nobility under his control. He rose to power 87 years ago, overthrowing the pitiful kingdom that he was raised in, and building an empire from its ashes. Iarran rules with an Iron fist, which seems harsh to many citizens of the empire, but it seems reasonable due to the fact that the lower class has been reduced 90% since the emperor grew to power, and there aren't any slums in the city. Despite these facts, many citizens despise their strict ruler. Iarran believes that he has the right to rule, that he has been chosen by the Gods, of which there are many legends. The empire of Lapsus has been blessed by the gods with a large variety of flora and fauna, including magical creatures and vegetation, such as musical mushrooms and furious dragons.*  \n\n[*https://discord.gg/efWbH9*](https://discord.gg/efWbH9)",

            "selftext": "Hey there, looking for new RP buddies!\n\nI've been RPing well over 12 years, from RL sites to Harry Potter extensions and everything in between. I love to write, I post at least one day, if not more, if just depends on my muse and the quality of the plot. I tend to write anywhere from 400--1200 words on average, so I can ease back or go for longer, depending on the situation. I do not expect my partners to match my word count, word for word, but I do expect quality replies from someone who cares about the plot. I also expect my RP partners to be my friends! I love to talk about real-life things, music, movies, topics, not just our made-up ones. However, yes, I do also love to share, gifs, photos, and ships of our characters!! &lt;3\n\nAs far as characters, I do not mind doubling up at all, but *my goal is to play my F character against a M character.*\n\nLately, I've been RPing Harry Potter so that's what I'm looking for. I generally RP on dedicated sites so my ideal partner would have to be willing to join my HP site.\n\nHMU if interested\\~  \nSmokey",

            "selftext": " \n\nHey,\n\nSo, I am looking for some new partners, mostly because I feel like I need more active ones than the ones I currently have. So, I have a few ideas that I am looking to roleplay in a 1x1. Keep in mind that I am in search of romance to be laced in these RPs, and I do participate in NSFW, so if that's not for you then feel free to skip over. Keep note that ALL of these are 1x1, okay?\n\n**Fandoms:**\n\n* **Ace Attorney:** I am looking to roleplay out Kristoph Gavin/Vera Misham. I had this idea where she technically visits him, even though he is clearly still mad at her, eventually manipulates her into helping him because Vera is very guilty about what happened to him, even if it was her father that he killed. I think it would be interesting if she did manage to do something that aided in his escaping jail, in which, Kristoph would try to get revenge on the people responsible(i.e Vera) but ends up living with her and 'using' her skills to create a new identity. For this RP, I could play Wright and Apollo for extra characters, possibly Trucy too but I would very much LOVE a Kristoph Gavin.\n* **Silent Hill**: I am in search of someone to play James Sunderland, Walter Sullivan or Vincent but I REALLY am looking for a **James**. The idea with James is based on the ending where he becomes part of the cult, but instead of being completely selfish, he does see that Angela did actually need someone and ATTEMPTS to try to rectify being a terrible person. When it comes to Water/Vincent, it is also cult-related but we would probably discuss that together because that is a little more complicated. While I am not exclusively looking for James, that is mostly what I am looking for because I am playing Angela Orosco, but I would be open to someone playing an OC that knew her from high-school or someone who was a regular at the shop she used to waitress at.\n\n**Genres**\n\n* Sci-fi Setting: I am looking for a partner to play a character kinda like Connor(Android Investigator) from Detroit Beyond Human. I am looking for a romantic pairing between him and a human. This is a super futuristic roleplay, so it's scifi and has space ships, earth and traveling to other planets while these two individuals try to figure one another out with some post-apocalypse themes.\n* Fantasy Setting: I have my own setting to work with, so I'd really like to do that. I am really craving a best-friends separated but reunited type of storyline. I prefer a lot of added genres in my RPs: romance, actions, adventure, etc Just saying though, if you have some Durzo Blint/Kylar type character, please give him to me. If you've never read the books those characters are in, they are assassins that are rough around the edges with a high moral code. My fantasy setting is similar, sorta, to Avatar: The Last Airbender, so it has hard magic.\n* Post-Apocalypse Setting: This is kind of like a mixture of fallout(sorta)/death stranding. I was looking to play a scientist character, kind of like Lockne from DS. This setting is very much not finished, it is bare-bones at best and anyone super into post-apoc could greatly attribute.\n\n***What I am looking for in a player:***\n\n* **Multi-Para, but quality over quantity.**\n* **Third Person only.**\n* **Adults only. Roleplays are 90% plot, 10% NSFW but also have other themes.**\n* **Communicative (I want to legit be friends, and I love talking about our RPs, so hopefully you do too, lol.)**\n* **Active Poster: 2-4 times a week or daily if possible.**\n* **When responding to this post, feel free to message or chat me. I'll respond to both. Thanks!**",

            "selftext": "Disclaimer: Title is joke, I'm not actually as narcissistic as it makes me sound.\n\nHeyyo! I'm your friendly neighborhood RP Boi. I'm twenty, lonely, and looking for friends to with which to story write in a manner that is collaborative. I've had a semester of English Major experience before my crappy semester of Computer Science took my college funding. Now I work at Papa Johns taking people pizza in hopes that they sign my paycheck. Basically what I'm saying is I'm writing Jesus. In all seriousness, I've been collaboratively story writing since I was thirteen and I have at least a little skill. At least I'd like to think so. I'm most likely around the lower end of literate. Nowhere near advanced lit. If you beg to differ, feel free to tell me rather than be rude. I'm always open to constructive criticism, but I haven't really had enough experience with the RP community at large to know one-hundred percent. If you decide you have to dog me about post length please, respectfully, save your time. I've been trying to go longer for a while now but I've only had one regular partner since age 13 so I haven't been able to grow much.\n\nAll in all I'd like to rp with someone who's willing to make a long term friend. I love fantasy. Sci-Fantasy, High Fantasy, Modern Fantasy? Love it all. I honestly don't think in my seven years of collaborative story writing I've ever truly created a world without magic. That said, I'd really like to try Sci-Fi. And who knows, maybe you can show me the beauty of other genres. Hopefully we can make a cool world together. I'm not really interested in Fandom at the moment due to the amount of fun I've had with them so far being practically negative.\n\nAs for what I expect: It's gonna be that we use the same format, that you can spell, and that you can use correct grammar and punctuation. I can let post length go, especially since I can't go very long myself. I would like if you are able to respond multiple times a day. I have a job as well though, so I definitely understand the limiting factors, just make sure to keep me posted whenever you need to bounce. Other than that I would love to hear from everybody! I promise I'll respond even if I think that we won't jive just to make sure I give everyone a fair shake.",

            "selftext": "Howdy All!\n\nI'm currently looking to set up a long term **MY HERO ACADEMIA** x Dragon Ball Z crossover rp. The long running idea requires another person to take the part of one of the member of Class 1-A (ideally Deku or Bakugo.) The synopsis is that a character from DBZ ends up stuck within the MHA setting and has to adapt and hide what they are to ensure they don't cause a panic, taking the guise of a hero (given the looks not a huge leap) - befriending the 1-A member and becoming something of a mentor as they go through various adventures. (**This idea is 100% SFW**)  \n  \nThemes would be most similar to MHA, Comedy, action, slice of life, drama and all those fun things. Set around the era of late s2-s3, the rp is set up to be quite a long term adventure and explore a lot of character interaction.\n  \nThe partner I'm ideally looking for:  \n- 18+ (part of the rules of this place anyway)  \n- Knowledge of MHA (DBZ knowledge is 100% not needed and could work more)  \n- At least 1 reply per week (though more would be nice)  \n- Multi para   \n- Third person  \n- Willing/ eager to contribute their own ideas to the story.  \n  \nSo that's about the long and short of it, there's a few more specific details I can give in private.   \n  \nI hope to find someone interested in this idea, if you're looking to explore the fun world of My Hero Academia with a fun little twist in a long term detailed RP, please don't hesitate to get in touch. I look forward to hearing from you!  \n  \nThanks!",

I'm just looking for females who would be willing to participate in a pregnancy rp with me.\n\nPerhaps I did not make myself extremely clear in the last post, and hence I will be stating some specifics and preferences so that you'd be more in the know.\n\n- Usually prefer to roleplay as friends/strangers who become friends throughout the story.\n- Prefer if the pregnancy was more non-conventional (i.e. mother is human but baby is not).\n- Therefore, such pregnancies may include aliens, eggs, or creatures from folklore/myths/fantasies.\n- The plot usually starts out with the mother not knowing the baby isn't human, with gradual suspicions making her convinced that it's something else. The story also usually ends in a birth.\n\nHope to find someone to have such a roleplay here, and if this intrigues you, do drop me a message!\n\nThanks once again!",

            "selftext": " \n\nHey everyone, I\u2019m looking for any rp\u2019ers of semi-literate or novella skill level to take part in a fun scifi-themed rp, with inspirations from Ms. Kobayashi\u2019s Dragon Maid, Expelled from Paradise, Planetary Annihilation, and Invader Zim.\n\nMillions of years ago, several galaxies away from the milky way, there was the Contingency, an ancient machine race, bent on gaining knowledge by conquering all the other races of the universe. By assimilating the knowledge of species, they hoped to learn the secrets of existence itself, even enough to perhaps end the heat death of the universe itself. But after many different organic races united against the Contingency, a great war erupted, but ultimately led to the destruction of Nekro\u2019s kind, except one.\n\nJettisoned off into space during one of the skirmishes leading up to the final battle of the Contingency\u2019s homeworld, Nekro-67 was one of many of the race\u2019s control hubs, a synaptic control center responsible for the Contingency\u2019s countless legions of worker and military drones. Created as an alternative for the current Hub ruling over Contingency Sector A-27, she was left in stasis in the event of the current hub being destroyed in the war.\n\nLaunched from one of the Contingent\u2019s war fleets into empty space, with not much regard to where Nekro, and a small number of her machine kin, would end up... mostly out of hopes of creating new bastions of the Contingency. Nekro-67 drifted aimlessly in space for millions of years, far from her own galaxy until finally ending up in the gravity well of a nearby galaxy, the milky way, before ending up in a young Solar System and crash landing in the Rocky Mountain range, where a young, female astronomer just happened to be watching.\n\nFeel free to comment here or shoot me a pm with your discord name. Either role is fine with me, so don\u2019t be shy!\n\nThanks everyone!",

I'll make a backstory and the AU is in the title. Anyway here is the backstory for this. I hope it won't make you sadder the what's going around, but it'll be cute and it'll be part of the roleplay. **Backstory for this role play:** Mic adopts Izuku when he was eight days old. when Deku was four they went to the quirk specialist and found out that Deku was quirkless. At the end of Izuku's first day, walking to his father's agency. he gotten hit by a high usage quirk that made him lose controls and feelings in both of his hands, and lost half of his bladder function and needs to wear diapers for the rest of his life. I'll roleplay with anyone and be anyone within this roleplay for you.",

I don't want an ERP, won't be tolerated. I don't mind it in the game, but it can't be the main focus.\n* I love ooc and am very friendly, world-building beforehand is huge.\n* I prefer playing mxf couples. I love doubling up or playing the female, though I usually want to double up anyway. I will also play multiple plots so if you will play the male to my plot I will do the same for you! I can do separate games for double up purposes, I'm super flexible.\n* Just because a topic isn't listed here doesn't mean I'm closed to other ideas. I **love** tropes and cliches. I love original plots.\n* I am 21, looking for partners 18+.\n* I am flexible about where we post, though I prefer Discord.\n\nwhat I'm looking for\n\n* Please be semi lit to lit, at minimum two decent paragraphs. I can't respond to three sentences.\n* I want some kind of lost love story, like a vampire meeting their reincarnated lover. Something kinda cheesy like that.\n* Other plots: apocalypse / sirens / werewolves / **shifters** / vampires / poor x rich / arranged marriage\n* I'm also open to many other ideas as long as they aren't Fandom based and aren't just slice of life. In all plots, I am more than happy to double up.\n* I want someone who can match the content of my post and can post on a semi-regular basis.\n* I'm looking for someone I can chat with outside of the game and just generally make a new friend with!\n\nHope you message me! Would love to do some world-building.",

I can do pretty much do anything, except for smut, I won't do it.\n\n**Writing:** I match what my partners write, but I like to write a paragraph or two. I don't like one-liners, and it makes it very hard for me to think of a response and I most likely won't respond. I only do third person, past tense, but I don't mind if you do present. I've been roleplaying for 13+ years, and I do have a lot of experience, and I understand how I was when I first started out, but it does bug me a little when people use 'your' instead of 'you're' and so forth, but I can mostly overlook this. I prefer quantity over quality, and a reliable rp partner.\n\n**Plot:** I don't really have a set plot in mind, I have a few plot ideas in mind, but I'm open to hear yours too! Or we can come up with a general idea and go from there, or come up with something of our own! I'm a sucker for romance and the fluff it comes with, again, just no smut. I also like fantasy, slice of life, etc, just anything that seems interesting! There are some, like sci-fi, that I'm not into.\n\n**Characters:** I can play both male and female, but I don't always want to play the male character, I have an equal amount of both characters that I like to use. I also double too, so keep that in mind!\n\nIf you're still here after all of that, and you are interested, please drop a line!",

            "selftext": "Howdy All!\n\nI'm currently looking to set up a long term **MY HERO ACADEMIA** x Dragon Ball Z crossover rp. The long running idea requires another person to take the part of one of the member of Class 1-A (ideally Deku or Bakugo.) The synopsis is that a character from DBZ ends up stuck within the MHA setting and has to adapt and hide what they are to ensure they don't cause a panic, taking the guise of a hero (given the looks not a huge leap) - befriending the 1-A member and becoming something of a mentor as they go through various adventures. (**This idea is 100% SFW**)  \n  \nThemes would be most similar to MHA, Comedy, action, slice of life, drama and all those fun things. Set around the era of late s2-s3, the rp is set up to be quite a long term adventure and explore a lot of character interaction.\n  \nThe partner I'm ideally looking for:  \n- 18+ (part of the rules of this place anyway)  \n- Knowledge of MHA (DBZ knowledge is 100% not needed and could work more)  \n- At least 1 reply per week (though more would be nice)  \n- Multi para   \n- Third person  \n- Willing/ eager to contribute their own ideas to the story.  \n  \nSo that's about the long and short of it, there's a few more specific details I can give in private.   \n  \nI hope to find someone interested in this idea, if you're looking to explore the fun world of My Hero Academia with a fun little twist in a long term detailed RP, please don't hesitate to get in touch. I look forward to hearing from you!  \n  \nThanks!",

            "selftext": "Hello, redditors! I'm looking for another roleplay to fill out my time!\n\nNotes about me: I'm Brazilian, 37, work full time (at least while company is still rolling), and try to post in a timely manner. I am looking solely for someone to write with through reddit PMs or other non-real-time venues. I don't do Discord or other chat platforms.\n\nPlot I'm interested in at the moment:\n\nAmerica's sweethearts are everyone's favorite couple. They're young, rich, good-looking, and seem to have the perfect life. They're the couple everyone looks up to. That is, until the fairy dust starts wearing out and they start seeing that real life is not as glamorous. It can be time constraints, one of them taking interest in someone else, or her getting pregnant - mostly due to pressure to make their family look perfect - and not having enough time or energy to devote to the marriage, leading him to look for attention elsewhere. My idea is to either have them both be famous or just one of them, and watch as they start getting tired of this life. What they'll do - carry on and pretend, work on the marriage, or just up and divorce - is up to us, but I'd really love them to finish the story arc together.\n\nI am looking for someone to write the husband. This roleplay will be *clean*/*fade to black*. That's non negotiable.\n\nIf you're interested, shoot me a PM! (I don't open chat messages) Thank you for reading!",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReally missing RPing in this fandom, so I have decided to just take a gamble and see if I may be fortunate enough to find a person who'd like to roleplay some good ol' Ace Attorney with me.  \n\n\nI've been RPing for about 15 years now, and I like to think I am fairly literate. English is my secondary language, however, so mistakes will happen. I also do tend to occasionally miss some hard to spot typos that slip in to my posts since I do type rather fast. My post length, depending on the situation, can vary from 3 paragraphs to \"Whoa there, buddy, why did you go and post a book?\" I personally don't care for the length of posts that much, however. I care much more about its contents. Does it help move the RP forward? Does it respond adequately to what I posted? Does it give me something to work with in return? Nothing is as unrewarding as getting a superficial bland half-baked response to a post I've worked hard on.  \n\n\nI am a sucker for writing out observations, emotions, and thoughts. I find relaying what moves a character, in posts, a very important thing. Get them feels in, you know? I love immersing myself into the mind of a character I am writing for, and I love to see my partner do the same.   \n\n\nI am pretty much open to anything. Different AUs, which ever timeline from the series, nsfw stuff, action,  comedy, romance, slice of life, you name it. I prefer a healthy mix of all the elements, really. Also, any romance suggestions (with possible smut, long as it's with plot) I am open to as well, regardless of either gender, as long as... I feel it's a character I can/want to play adequately, and can see it being potentially and canonically possible. (As in: I can't ever force two charas that obviously dislike each other into a romance.) Anyway, we can discuss what you'd like and see if we can work something out! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do prefer a 1 on 1 roleplay. If we really hit it off, we can always see if we want to expand eventually. Anyway, the idea is we'd both pick at least a main character we'd play, and focus mainly on a plot involving those, but pick up/allocate \"side-characters\" along the way if the story/plot we're going for, requires it. I would prefer if I could at least play Phoenix, however, whether it is a main focus character or a side-character, because I've been playing him for years now and I miss it. \n\n  \nI would also love to discuss plots and just chat OOC, hopefully becoming friends. I find it important to have fun and to be feeling comfortable with a person I roleplay with. I do prefer my partner(s) to be at least 18+ for possible NSFW themed things.  \n\n\nI also prefer honesty. If you feel burnt out on the RP, lose interest, or are otherwise too busy and wanna take a break for a while, just tell me, don't start ghosting, please. It's perfectly fine and I'd understand, it happens to everyone, even me. Also, if the RP doesn't turn out to be to your liking,  or you want things changed/have a problem with something in the RP, I am more than happy to hear about it and see if we can work it out. The point is that we both have fun, after all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast but not least, I would prefer to RP on Discord, for starters, at least.   \n\n\nIf interested hit me up, feel free to PM me on here, if you want. I'll get back to you asap. If we come to the conclusion that we both have something we'd be keen on doing RP wise within this fandom, we can then exchange our Discord handles and get that party started!",

            "selftext": "Sometimes memories of long bygone times jump back into my mind. Like uneventful flashbacks triggered by nothing, leaving but a sweet taste of nostalgia. The latest occurrence left the taste of strawberry in my mouth. The latest occurrence was a flash back to the first time I met Marla.\nI was on the parking lot of my university. It\u2019s odd how I distinctively remember wearing my bright yellow jacket that day. Sadly it only had the aesthetic of a raincoat and not the properties. The pathetic polyester fabric it consisted of stood no chance of protecting my body against the volley of raindrops being shot at it from some ephemeral cannon in the heavens. I always enjoyed walking around campus - the university me and Marla studied at the time was a huge ancient building and I just loved gazing upon the architectural structures and traces from a time long gone by. Both of us studied medicine. Well I was studying medicinal microbiology and she was a medschool major. I remember her saying that it was ironic that she would choose that career. That wasn\u2019t until a few weeks after the evening I spent on the rainy parking lot. I didn\u2019t understand what she was referring to. Until I did.\nAs my eyes wandered from car to car I couldn\u2019t help but notice a figure leaning on one of them. Their silhouette shifted position not as if trying to hide from my gaze but more like it was switching its modus operandi - a mental shift of behaviour-when-unseen switched to behaviour-when-observed, I could never could have described what I\u2019ve seen as detailed as I am doing right now at the time that I witnessed it. Now that I understand what I saw that evening it\u2019s much easier for me to put into words.\n\u201cSo, how we gonna do this? You talk first? I talk first?\u201d The figure spoke. That was the first time I heard Marla\u2019s voice. I\u2019m not that social and I usually have difficulty identifying people based on their voice alone. Marla marks the only exception of that quirk. There is some odd, unreal quality to the way she talks. It\u2019s not the things she says or the way she says them. I think it might be about her cadence of voice or how she pronounces words. Sophisticated would be a wrong term to describe it but it comes close if you leave away the stiffness associated to that way of talking. Any way you choose to describe it - something about the way she quoted Star Wars at me invoked strange connotations. There just was this strange antediluvian quality to her voice. As if the woman talking to me at the campus parking lot was way older than the brownish red old-timer car her body was leaning on or even older than the ancient parking site the was standing on.\n\u201cStar Wars huh? Hate the new movies.\u201d Was my panicked response. At 19:00 on my campus parking lot I met the most interesting person I\u2019ve ever met in my entire life and the very first thing I\u2019ve ever said to her was a throwaway line berating the Star Wars sequel trilogy.\n\u201cYea.\u201d She retorted. \u201cAnyway what are you doing around here?\u201d \nI was even more surprised to have to explain my presence on the publicly accessible campus grounds - considering the heavy downpour, no, artillery fire of rain droplets that evening my presence was more than questionable \u201cMe?\u201d This was the moment my quick thinking skills sprung into action. \u201cI\u2019m just walking to my car.\u201d My quick thinking skills proved to be flawed and vastly underdeveloped. I did not own a car at the time. Something told me Marla knew that. Maybe not in detail but she did have a certain look in her eyes letting me know that she could tell I was lying to her. \u201cShould I even ask what you\u2019re doing here?\u201d Was all I could ask.\nMarla never got along with the others. She just didn\u2019t choose to. I always admired that about her. While my frat boy friends indulged in getting drunk or high or any other kind of degeneracy she just took those long walks in the woods. Later on I would join her. Just once. I would get bored quickly. There just was something about the forest that kept drawing her in again and again, she would tell me later - and you could tell. \n\u201cI\u2019m not gonna question how far \u2018walking to your car\u2019 entails walking three concentric circles around an almost empty parking lot during heavy rain if you don\u2019t ask why I\u2019m leaning against a stranger\u2019s car in that same aforementioned heavy rain.\u201d she said.\nI chuckled and so did she. I thought about ways to further the conversation. I kept circling back to wanting to ask her what she was doing here. I wasn\u2019t supposed to ask that question so I said nothing. Neither did she. As the laughter subsided she just left and I was standing there just as alone as I thought I was before, but feeling infinitely more alone than I actually was.\nI wouldn\u2019t see her in the classes we shared the next day and neither did I the week after that.\nThe next time that I actually did see her was when I went jogging in the woods. She was writing something in a small leather book as she was sitting cross-legged on a tree stump. Marla had an interesting phase of fashion at that time where she would wear shades of red and blue that would look black if even the slightest shadow would hit them and only reveal their colours when subjected to light being directed straight at them. I could tell because some rays filtered by the lush leafs above her hit her skirt making it shine in dark navy blue.\n\u201cI never caught your name.\u201d Was the sentence I picked from my faltering mind to establish a conversation with, because for some reason neither of us seemed to be capable of starting a conversation like normal flipping people. \n\u201cIt\u2019s Marla. Parents named me after the drug addict chick from Fight Club.\u201d\n\u201cTough Luck, I\u2019m Laertes - my parents decided to be pretentious about it.\u201d\nShe chuckled over our shared fate of stupid names and went on to quote: \u201cBe wary than, best safety lies in fear: Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cQuoting Hamlet to join the club of pretentious folks.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cHamlet? The play you just insinuated your parents named you after?\u201d\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\n\u201cNow you\u2019re just kidding me\u201d To be fair I wasn\u2019t kidding her, I just had horrible people skills at that time and whatever part is responsible for social conversation (frontal, temporal and parietal lobes) just seemed to kinda black out. She didn\u2019t mind and carried the conversation on.\nAnd it just kept going - for weeks after that. We bonded over being voluntary outsiders of a culture of drinking and partying that frankly disgusted us. The time we spent retaining brain cells and health we spent together. Turns out Marls knows how to write Cyrillic. She taught me some letters. A few days after that she disappeared. \nShe actually told me about it. Via text. A single message simply reading \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d. A frugal apology considering the massive hole that woman left in my life. She blocked me after sending it.\nI actually went to her house to see if she was alright a few days after contact subsided. I made my way there through a massive hailstorm matching the intensity of the storm from the first time I saw her. It was way colder though. \nBefore my hasty steps could even make their way up the chiseled stone path to the dark wood door a look inside the window revealed to me a change in drapes and right behind them a change in occupants. Making sure I decided to knock anyway and the current tenants elaborated on moving there just a day prior.\nSomeone who changed my life so monumentally was gone in almost an instant leaving me with nothing but confusion.\nI soon was distracted from my grief of separation when a week after my journey to Marla\u2019s former house a streak of violent crime hit our community of students. The beloved janitor Gustav F. Was found dead by an undergrad at 6:24 a.m. on Thursday the first of October, a week after that two policemen investigating the crime and in doing so examining the university grounds stumbled upon the dead bodies of a professor and a researcher stacked neatly together in one of the lockers by the courts. No official or spokesperson would elaborate on a possible cause of death or motive of the perpetrator but when questioned about either topic would quickly change the subject not before halting in their speech and going pale. It might have been my very-late-teenage idiocy, my regular not-age-dependent idiocy or curiosity and interest in crime that I took it upon myself to foolishly interfere with policework and go out one night looking for clues myself. There was an obvious connection between Marla and the crimes my brain was too afraid to make, yet somewhere in the back of my mind a thought about my friend being a potential victim as well kept lingering. Before my brain could naturally make a connection between Marla and the murder spree it was suddenly forced to when I strolled, flashlight in hand, through the dark corridors of the nighty abandoned university building when the cone of light pertruding from said flashlight hit the body of a human cowering in a pool of blood.\nThe person that I shone my light upon that night wasn\u2019t the dead body of the dean who was the final person to be reported missing the early morning following that fateful night.\nThe light I shone upon that person that night made their blood-drenched skirt glow in dark navy blue.\nI took three sleepless nights and sixteen ones filled with nightmares to realise the horrifying connection of my missing friend Marla to the deaths of four people working at the school. Due to charges of assault and misconduct against the female students being pressed against the dead men some activists at our uni spoke about the murders as acts of heroic vigilante justice. For me it was four violent, disgusting crimes committed by the person I had deemed least likely to do so.\nMarla was antisocial sure - but not psychopathic. There just was no reason for her to do something so horrible I could come up with. In hindsight it does make a lot of sense.\nA second tragedy unfolded country-wide just months after the crime spree as a new fearsome illness caused nationwide lockdowns. A respiratory disease labelled ZaVid-22 had proven incredibly deadly and infectious was befalling our country - including myself. After first showing symptoms my roommate had me hospitalised, however intensive treatment did not seem to lessen my ailments which only seemed to increase exponentially. Equally horrible was the weather. Some floors of the hospital were actually due to be closed because of potential flooding due to the heavy downpour, luckily my room as exempt from that decision.\nAs my trachea kept tightening letting less and less air into my lungs dying for oxygen and as rainfall and storms kept increasing in frequency in some such nights I did spot a figure in my room. Leaning against a wall. Usually the figure would remain in my vicinity for mere seconds before ultimately vanishing again.\nThe symptoms reached their peak on December the fourteenth as one rainy night I woke up finally now completely unable to breath. In a panicked flurry my eyes sped across the room desperately searching for aid. Scanning the room over and over again in motionless fear with each rotation cycle of my pupils the figure not only reappeared but also slowly made it way over to me in sluggish steps before reaching my bed. Soon after I was looking into Marla\u2019s hazel eyes. Her face had an expression of sadness on it. Sadness and utter shame in what she did and had to do. Marla\u2019s big eyes kept gazing into mine as her slightly opened lips parted wider. In my desperate dying moments I opened mine in parallel hoping for a final kiss to send me off. To my surprise her mouth was headed straight to my neck, hesitating there soon after a quiet, and second, \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d was audible a felt two sharp teeth piercing the skin of my throat. The headaches induced by stress-fuelled blood shooting into my brain subsided as I felt it slowly make it\u2019s way down my neck. During my asphyxiation induced stupor I had been audibly witnessing the unrelenting staccato my panicked heart beat had become in my moment of fear. With each beat I was experiencing it did not only slow down but it\u2019s pumping felt lighter as it was slowly being relieved of the payload it had to carry until it finally ceased its function. Soon after I felt a strong tingling sensation originate from the wound on my neck - a feeling I only had known prior from receiving shots at a clinic. As that feeling spread all over my body I was able to open my eyes again. What had felt like minutes must have been hours as my looking around the room revealed to me a hospital room drenched in basking sunlight. It wasn\u2019t until my pupils wandered to my right that I saw my friend Marla sitting next to my bed patiently awaiting my awakening. My hand was being held by hers. My skin complexion had now assumed a marble-white paleness matching hers.\nWhatever murderous, twisted abomination comprised her physiology was now mine too. Whatever horrifying, ancient mystery made her the puzzling way she was just happened to save my life.",

I tend to write 1-2 paragraphs, but can do longer occasionally, shorter is however hard for me\n\nFor my partner: Be over 18, and don't live too many time zones away!\n\nI have a few scenarios in mind I'd like to try out, though nothing set in stone, and I'm very much open to tweak and fiddle with ideas to make them fit better for everyone involved, though I'd quite enjoy there to be some romance(slow burn, I don't want anything to feel super rushed, or forced y'know), some amount of external (and potentially internal) conflict, and some Drama. I do only play as trans men(&amp; bottoms tbfh), so if you're not comfy with that, it's not a match, sorry!\n\nTo not turn this post a mile long, here's some vague descriptions of a few of the plots I have in mind:\n\nSeen Treasure Planet? Yes? No? Great anyways! So, it's pirates, but in space. Are our characters rival captains who have to start working together to escape/overcome a common enemy/obstacle? A new crewmember and the poor soul who has to teach them to not fall overboard? Something Completely Different?\n\nA florist who has struck up an unusual deal with the local gang/mob, supplying funeral flowers multiple times a month, at twice the normal cost, in exchange for his silence in a case they witnessed, it does of course help that the person picking up the flowers is quite polite, and attractive. Though eventually, it turns out that making deals with people avoiding the law, isn't always a safe option.\n\nSomething based Loosely on Starz' Spartacus, Whitechapel, or Black Sails\n\nMore ideas can be discussed in dms.",

I usually like my roleplays a little more on the lighter side, with just general SoL tropes. I don't like high fantasy or to get into any too crime-ridden or dark themes. Just trying to have some fun and romance and maybe a dash (okay two dashes) of smut.\n\nWe can do highschool/college students, or roommates or co-workers, or neighbors. I'm not too picky, I'd just like to have a few long-term RP partners to help me escape from my stressful life.\n\nWe can do it on KiK or Discord, or whatever really, just send me a PM and we can go from there.\n\nThank you for reading.",

The Third Leg was always a rowdy place, but this was the night before Dedrick day, and the pub was much more cramped than usual. \n\nHe budged his way to a table, removed his flat cap and ordered a pint. Every time the door would open, Brennan looked up from his drink. When his appointment finally arrived, he had been tracing the scratches on the tabletop and didn\u2019t even notice the arrival of Lee Murphee.   \n\u201cLee,\u201d Brennan greeted him. \u201cIt\u2019s about time,\u201d he said, ever impatient. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for half an hour.\u201d His Galwick accent was always heavy after a drink.   \n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you too,\u201d Lee smiled.  \n\u201cDo you have it?\u201d Brennan asked.  \nLee looked around the pub and sat at the table. \u201cUnder the table.\u201d\n\nBrennan reached under the table and felt the cold stock of the pistol against his hand. He quickly took the gun and shoved it in his waistband. \u201cIs it still happening?\u201d Brennan asked. His leg was shaking.\n\n\u201cO\u2019 Course,\u201d his partner said, a cheeky smile had grown on his face. \u201cIt\u2019s 1915. Those Engrids should not have dominion over us any longer.\u201d\n\nA song had started in the pub, and Brennan saw this as his exit opportunity. He stood, smirking back at the black haired man. \u201cSee you on the 19th then, Murphee.\u201d He put on his hat and walked into the cold, spring night.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHey everyone! I'm looking for a partner for this prompt! No, those are not spelling errors. The RP I'm aiming for will be based off Irish Revolutionary history, yes, but it will not be our history. This way, there are no historical constraints. \n\nI have a couple of ideas for the RP itself, so message me if you're interested! Hope to see you soon!",

            "selftext": "Greetings and thank you for reading this. I\u2019ll start with a little about myself. I am a literate and experienced, mature-age roleplayer who has played across multiple platforms including chat, emails and even MMOs. My interests lie in both the small-scale character building and the large-scale worldbuilding that accompanies it.\n\nWhat I am looking for in a partner is somebody similar who has a similar approach to mine. I believe that two way communication is key to success in a RP relationship and that the players should not only engage with each other, but also feel free discuss and suggest plot, story and worldbuilding ideas. I will only roleplay with partners who are over the age of 18 (and characters that are similarly aged) although I prefer 21+\n\nI admit what I have is less a prompt as much a character/story idea that I've been wanting to play for some time. I've been looking to play a Dark Side character; specifically somebody from a background where such was inevitable, such as being a part of the Sith in some incarnation.\n\nThe goal here is to avoid the usual pitfalls that accompany such scenarios that usually see them fall into festivals of stupid evil for the sake of it. What I rather want to do is explore such a character and the environment in which they live, and such things as the balance of duty, obedience, doctrine, free will and the like.\n\nI prefer to play via email or Discord. If you are interested, please **PM** me. I will **not** reply to posts on this thread or chat requests.",

Gathering up the skirts of her crimson tunic, Eleane ran to the edge of the clearing from where she could gain a view of the sea below. Death moved in the morning, like clouds at night which obscured the moon, and her heart lurched at the sight of three longships, in full sail, skimming the waves as they headed straight for the inlet closest to her home. There could be no mistaking their destination, nor their murderous intent.*\n\n*Each vessel thronged with men. She estimated perhaps forty in total. All would be hardened, fierce warriors, bloodthirsty, ready to kill and destroy. She had heard tales. She knew full well the savage ferocity of these Nordic raiders. Their reputation went before them.*\n\n*Fear wrapped around her like a dark cape, and if it was possible, she lost what little amount of color remained in her face. She was terribly afraid of dying because she hadn\u2019t yet lived.*\n\n*With despairing sob, the young woman turned from the sight below. She could still run, might be able to make it into the depths of the forest before the first of the raiders reached the village. She had perhaps a few minutes...*\n\nHello,\n\nI recently lost one of my long term RP partners, and I\u2019m looking for someone who is detailed and descriptive to create a story with me. :)\n\nI'm a 21+ very laid back female from Europe. English is not my primary language, but I consider myself literate, however, I feel that word has been overused here.\n\nWhat I\u2019m looking for now:\n\n* 21+\n* Looking for a Male character\n* I write exclusively on Discord\n* Third-person past tense, please\n* Detailed, descriptive, I believe in quality over quantity, but I will always provide at least 3 detailed paragraphs per response *(much longer than the sample above)*\n* Someone who is willing to breathe life into the world with passion\n* Your character would be a fierce, proud, handsome but ruthless Viking warlord, a beast of a man, and my young Lady would be from a different world, a daughter of a Celt noble. \n* Adventure, medieval, fantasy, romance *(can be dark or lighthearted, or a healthy balance of both)*.\n* I like to include NSFW elements.\n* Looking for a long term writing partner.\n\nLike most people, I have a job and real-life :) I\u2019m more active during weekdays, and can typically put out one longer post per day, and if something happens and I get busy, I would let you know before.\n\nIf you like this idea, feel free to dm me instead of comments or chat. :) Thank you!",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone, my name is Cora and I have been roleplaying for around 10 years now. I mostly work in fantasy based roleplays, mixed with romance, drama, and action. I mostly play female characters, but can add male characters as my side roles through the rp. \n\nHowever, for this post, I am looking for someone to make a bit of a mainstream kind of Roleplay. One of the first rps I have ever done was about a demon making a contract with a human to kill a girl that refused him, but when the demon met the first, he was so shocked by her that he couldn\u2019t kill her and ended up trying to help her run from the guy that contacted him. The two went into hiding, and have to learn to live on the run, while battling the feelings they have been developing for one another. I\u2019m looking for someone to play as the demon character and perhaps a couple extra characters through the roleplay. Definitely need to be able to help me shape the world of the rp. And seeing as it will be set in modern times, please keep that in mind as they run around together. \n\nI will be wanting to rp through Discord. This will be an 18+ type of roleplay, please respect that when responding. So feel free to message me with any questions or comment.",

Working for an intergalactic syndicate shrouded in ambiguity, Contractors function above the law on any planet and complete warrants while maintaining a code of neutrality. It was an occupation perfect for the misfits in the universe -- for the people that felt they had no true home, no true allegiance.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;That was, of course, if you didn't mind an early death. \n\nHey there! I have a general structure set up for this RP, but there is a lot of room for world-building and lore creation. I'm looking for a partner with a creative streak that can help shape this universe alongside me! In a pre-dominantly sci-fi setting, this plot will involve hundreds of different \"missions\" and adventures of our choosing, allowing for a mixture of fantasy, supernatural, medieval, and apocalyptic genres. \n\nWe'll get down to the nitty-gritty together, but essentially our characters will meet somehow and team up aboard my character's ship. I would like to create an over-arcing \"super bad\" that will provide a lot of conflict, but there will be many subplots and side-stories involved. **I usually play strong, abrasive female characters and I'm looking for someone whose character complements that.** Here are a few things I need from a partner! :) \n\n\\- 18+ \n\n\\- Literate/3rd person/past tense. I'm asking for 1-2 paragraphs minimum, but I can definitely do more. I'll match your speed. (combat/dialogue are exceptions) \n\n\\- OCs with complexities, flaws, and depth! I want our two main characters to form a strong bond as the story develops. I don't mind romance (or smut), but it depends on how the story develops. \n\n\\- Able to handle multiple NPCs/minor characters if the plot requires, which I will also be doing.\n\nThis RP will have a lot of drama, violence, and action, so combat RP will be involved! By no means does your character have to be a fighter, though. :) \n\nLet me know if you're interested so I can see if we're a good fit!",

My favorite ships from the games are: RenxMakoto, RyujixAnn, RenxAkechi, but I am up for mixing two characters that dont quite get much fan attention as well.

I was thinking it would be cool to do an original Hogwarts story, with it being set in 5th year or up. I don\u2019t really have an idea for a plot right now, but I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts and see if we can come up with anything. \nKnow that I\u2019m looking to do a gay pairing. And I also ask that you are 20+ as I\u2019m not comfortable playing with anyone younger then that.\n\nMy Expectations are couldn\u2019t be anymore simple:\n\nI don\u2019t care care how long you\u2019re response is, as long as we\u2019re working together to build the story.\n\nI write in 3rd person and would prefer if you did as well\n\nI think feedback is critical, It\u2019s important to keep communicating while we play to make sure we\u2019re on the same page as each other and are happy about what\u2019s going on.\n\nAs annoying as they are, typos happen. I don\u2019t mind if they slip through on your end, please be lenient with me as well. \n\nLet\u2019s work together to bring in side characters when we need them. I really don\u2019t want to take too much attention from our MC\u2019s \n\nPlease be a fairly familiar with the Wizarding World.\n\nI don\u2019t really care what platform we use to play, PM, Reddit, Kik, discord. It doesn\u2019t matter to me.\n\nAlright that\u2019s all I have to say, if this is something that you\u2019d be interested in PM me so we can discuss. Have a great day guys and stay safe.",

            "selftext": "\u2026\u2026.from uncharted regions of the universe there comes an rper. An rper looking for some voltron! Defender of the universe! \n\nGreetings ladies, gents and fellow redditors. After binge watching even more voltron the cravings have returned full force and so has a new idea which I have put down below for anyone who\u2019d like the bare bones of it.\n\n*After the galra invasion on earth was successfully stopped and the enemy taken care of, everyone knows that the paladins spent some time on earth formulating a plan to go take down honnerva and save the universe. What would happen if they took a different route? One that involved creating other animal ships like the lions and training the cadets to use them? Well, that is what this idea is about. The paladins are worried that whilst they\u2019re off on big missions trouble could potentially occur somewhere else and voltron will be unable to help. to counter that risk the team discussed a plan and decided to propose it to the rest of the alliance: train the cadets to fly ships just like the lions. After some careful thinking (and considerable bickering on lance and Keith\u2019s part) the paladins put forth the plan and was surprised at the agreement it received. With the plan in action, the cadets would build a robotic animal companion that would serve as the model to their ship that they\u2019d build upon graduation. Thanks to special machinery developed by the holts themselves, space ships that once took months could be completed within a few days. With what was considered a peace period occurring, the paladins wanted to give the newer pilots and pilots to be as much time as possible to prepare for the war that wasn\u2019t yet over.*\n\nSounds awesome right? Well there are a few other very important things I need you to know about should this rp and I\u2019ve decide to list them down below for ease of reading:\n\n-the canon characters are playable but I will only be playing as an oc. I will not be doubling or taking control of multiple characters (npc or not) by myself as I prefer that we share the job.\n\n-If you want to ship canon characters you must organise that yourself in the rp. I will not play canon characters to fulfill your shipping desires. If you want to do oc x canon character shipping you must play as the canon character.  Oc x oc shipping is completely fine and I\u2019ve got no complaints about it just please do not have the first thing in your message be \u201cwhat ships do you do?\u201d Or \u201cwill you play this character so I can ship\u201d. All characters, canon or not, must be 18 or 18+ as underaged characters are a very big no. You must also be 18 or 18+ as I myself am in my very early twenties and will get into trouble for rping with a minor nor am I comfortable with rping with one.\n\n-There will be nsfw themes in this rp and there will be other adult themes.\n\n-There is going to be a mix of dotu, vf and vld lores and things in this rp. If you have not seen dotu Or vf that is okay and I\u2019ll happily tell you what it is as well as tell you where to find the shows themselves. \n\n-If you\u2019re gonna be a canon character please please PLEASE be flexible with them. You\u2019re not following the script of a show so you can do whatever you like with them whilst still keeping true to how they\u2019re portrayed.\n\n-Zarkon and lotor are not dead (they\u2019re still alive but they\u2019ve become their own separate threats to voltron, hence the need for such a plan in the first place.). Sendak is also alive (again, ask and I shall explain it).\n\n-There are alien cadets as well as human ones (furry, anthro, alien, half alien, list is endless and I\u2019ve always wondered why there was never any alien cadets.). I myself will be playing an alien character. Please do not try to debate the existence of hybrids as it\u2019s been proven in show that they can occur between other aliens and humans. If you don\u2019t like the fact that my character (hybrid or not) may not (and will not) look like a human then you don\u2019t need to bother messaging me.\n\n-I play premade (I don\u2019t care if you make one up on the spot) but flexible characters who are all male but swing both ways. Want a sweet and pure gay relationship? You got it! Want the traditional boy and girl relationship? You\u2019ve also got it! Just please no sub/ dom dynamics whether in the bedroom or in a normal situation (I understand preferences but please do not let that be the sole aspect of your characters personality).\n\n-This will be long term and i need you to answer at least once or more a day. Any less just unfortunately won\u2019t cut it for me (this of course doesn\u2019t apply to circumstances where you\u2019ve been too busy to even tell me why you\u2019ve not answered of course, life happens but preferably I\u2019d love it if you could warn me in advance if you have to disappear for a bit).\n\n-Bully x victim, rivals to lovers, former friends who become more. The possibilities of what kind of pairings that can occur are endless but slow burn romance only please. No love at first sight.\n\n-I will only rp on discord, google hangouts, emails and telegram. No where else.\n\n-What animal you choose, your personality, strengths, weaknesses and ability to work as a team will determine your eventual spot on the team you are placed on (animals can be mythical or normal. Hybrids are also welcome).\n\n-Unfortunately the pilots will not be able to make their own voltron (there can be only one).\n\n-One small paragraph written in third person with correct spelling, grammar and punctuation is the very minimal post requirement. No one liners.\n-I do not do face claims or pics, only descriptions.\n\nPlease make sure that you read all of this as I will not accept anyone who obviously has not. If you\u2019ve completely read this please DM me (NO REDDIT CHATS OR COMMENTS) and tell me your favourite voltron episode, what lion you think you\u2019d be and the numbers 123 to confirm that you\u2019ve read absolutely everything in this post. I look forward to hopefully getting a few partners to rp as and do not fret if I do not respond to a message right away as chances are that I\u2019ve not seen it yet. \n\nStay safe, wash your hands and happy rping.",

            "selftext": "Hello! As the title suggests, I want a GM to help me thrpugh this adventure. I've been wanting to do a plot like this for quite some time now. Below I will write a backstory. It is optional if you want to follow that one or create a new one with me. \n\n*The year is 2261. The United Nations of Earth started ramping up their interest in solar systems beyond our own. We had colonized Mars and Titan, and built a massive mining base on the moon. Humanity also constructed the Sol station. A massive station which orbits the sun. It serves as a hub for ships being constructed as well as maintained and repaired. The first colonizing attempts of Alpha Centauri had been launched decades ago and was well underway.*\n\n*Now the UNE glanced outwards. New colony missions were created left and right. This created a massive spike in the army who didn't have enough personell to aid every mission. Therefore the requirements changed from volunteers only, to men of ages 18-50. Females were able to volunteer*\n\nRebecka recently turned 19. She had just graduated from the military academy of Mars. She knows exactly what she wants to do with her carreer. She wants to volunteer to the military. Make new friends, explore space, meet aliens. That is what she is hoping.*\n\nWill reality be like that? Or much much grim for the poor recruits? Will the squad dynamic change as it is predominantly male? Or will she fit in? That is up to you. \n\nThis is just a basic background. We can always add more to it if you want. But I hope you get the general idea. Sort of slice of life-ish and full of interaction with my squad, and plenty of possibilities for aliens to fuck my brains out.\n\nKinks: Non-con, bdsm, restraint, size difference, deep fucking, anal, non-human dicks, creative breeding, impreg, ovi, mild pain, mild cum inflation.\n\nLimits: scat, incest, vomit\n\nLooking forward to your replies!",
