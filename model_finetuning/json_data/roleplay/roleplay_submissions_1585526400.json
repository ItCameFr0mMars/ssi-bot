            "selftext": "Greeting, fellow writers!\n\nI'm sure I'm like many of you, who are stuck working from home during this COVID-19 outbreak. I figured this was a better time than any to make a return to the collaborative writing world. I'm sure a lot has changed in the few years I've been away, but at the same time, I'm hopeful that there are some others out there who are also looking for literate, plot-driven stories.\n\n**A bit about me:**\n\n* I'm 31, and located on the East Coast US.\n* I work in the health sciences (thankfully not as a front-line worker), and also teach on the side at my local community college as an adjunct faculty member. \n* I spend most of my free time hiking, backpacking, and rock climbing, though with the Covid outbreak, I've been spending most of my time reading, cooking, and spring cleaning (always fun!). \n* I'm drawn to meaningful conversation, so I enjoy the idea of collaborating with writers who enjoy discussing themes, ideas, and concepts in both an abstract and literary sense. \n\n**What I'm looking for:**\n\n1. ***A collaborator.*** More than anything, I'm looking for a collaborator. As much as roleplaying is about a back-and-forth volley of posts, it's also a chance to explore literary themes and ideas in a creative and free manner. I crave those discussions where we take a simple idea, and through collaboration, it organically evolves into a meaningful and compelling narrative plot piece.\n2. ***Character-driven, emotionally-nuanced storylines.*** As much as I enjoy storylines that feature a pre-defined plot, I'm fascinated by stories that focus more on character growth arcs, and an exploration of how various plot points cause the character themselves to evolve over time. I'm sure most of us can easily recall a story we've written in the past that made us pause at a moment or two, and simply reflect, and say \"wow,\" due to how we resonated with the character's growth in the story.\n3. ***3rd person writing style; 2-5 paragraph range.*** While I've written stories in the novella range in the past, I've found that the 2-5 paragraph range tends to be a nice sweet spot. I've found that it allows for a nice rate of exchange between each partner's posts, while also providing sufficient opportunities for detail.\n4. ***Over the age of 18; ideally over 21.*** Given my age, I feel more comfortable writing with other adults - so I would appreciate honesty in this preference.\n5. ***Mutual respect and a shared desire to enjoy the process.*** At the end of the day, we're all writing here as an outlet from the stress and chaos of life. As a result, let's be respectful and have a mutual awareness that neither of us is going to be available 24/7. We all have lives, and need to step away from the computer/phone at times. \n\n**Some basic settings/ideas:**\n\n* **Historical:** Oregon Trail, Trail of Tears, World War II, 1960s (post-war America), Civil War, American Revolution, British Raj, Ottoman Empire, Russian Revolution, Song Dynasty, etc.\n* **Sci-Fi:** Post-Apocalyptic, Human Life on Foreign Planets, COVID-19 potential complications, etc. \n* **Modern:** Contemporary slice-of-life, workplace, action-driven modern, thrillers, mystery, crime-driven storylines, etc. \n\nIf any of this interests you, please send me a message, and we can begin a discussion to see if we're a good fit together as writers! I would respectfully ask that we define our characters together, and would prefer not to receive requests from writers who have pre-defined characters that they are looking to use. \n\nI look forward to hearing from you!",

            "selftext": "*\u201dAnd my heart won\u2019t beat again,*\n\n*If I can\u2019t feel you in my veins...\u201d*\n___________________________________________________\n\nGreetings everyone! Hopefully you\u2019re all staying safe during these troublesome times. Make sure to wash your vegetables and eat your hands. Wait...\n\nAnyways, I was inspired to write again, so here we are!\n\nI am an eighteen-year-old-female currently in college on PST time with six years of roleplay experience. I consider myself to be a third-person, literate roleplayer, meaning that I can write out between 200 and 400 words per response. Sometimes my responses can be much longer than that depending on what\u2019s happening in the roleplay, but that\u2019s just my average response. I like including mature and NSFW themes, but the latter of which only applies if there has been enough build up or a reason behind it.\n___________________________________________________\n\nSo I don\u2019t have a specific plot in mind for this actually. As the title says, I just really want to write a cheesy but deep, slow-burn romance story. One that involves drama and conflict between the characters as they struggle with their feelings and relationship. One where the characters grow and change over the course of the roleplay. Could be from any time period too: modern, Victorian, medieval, classic Greece, 1900s, etc. Could be any pairing: MxF (me as the female), MxM, FxF, etc. (Currently MxF is my preferred type, but that doesn\u2019t mean I won\u2019t do the other two). I\u2019m also fine with roleplaying most genres except for horror (which I just generally dislike) and sci-fi (my previous post was mainly about sci-fi, so I want to do something different this time).\n\nI have several ideas of what we can do with this, but all of these are also technically just concepts as well and not fully fleshed-out plots. I like doing this sometimes because it doesn\u2019t bind your character to one role. It only usually affects one part of your character\u2019s personality or status, and the rest you can decide on. Want your character to be part of a mafia and be deeply conflicted about it, but he has no choice but to uphold his family name? Go for it. The sky\u2019s the limit.\n\nAll of these tropes are probably dumb and cliche, but ya know what? \ud83c\udfb6~I don\u2019t care~ This is my post so I can do whatever I want to~\ud83c\udfb6 (pretend I sang that). Also, a lot of these ideas can probably be combined together, so that\u2019s a bonus.\n\nAnyways, here ya go (they\u2019re not in any particular order):\n\n\u2022 **Opposites Attract.** Two very different people meet and end up developing feelings for one another. The most cheesiest example I can think of is the \u201cBad Boy/Girl x Good Girl/Guy,\u201d which is a trope I do actually enjoy if done well (unlike some movies that I will not name).\n\n\u2022 **Enemies to Lovers.** I don\u2019t need to describe this one. It\u2019s pretty obvious what it is. The most common example I can think of is with a hero/heroine and villain/villainess. Doesn\u2019t have to be the traditional hero/villain though. It could also be like a twisted fairy-type type of thing.\n\n\u2022 **Forbidden Love.** Two people who aren\u2019t meant to be together still fall in love because yes. They could be from rival families/gangs or be of different social classes, or something else entirely.\n\n\u2022 **Cursed.** One (or both) of the individuals is cursed somehow and needs the other\u2019s help to break it. Could be more traditional with the \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d route, but it doesn\u2019t have to be. It can be an adventure type story where the two must travel together to find a cure for the curse. Will most likely involve some fantasy element.\n\n\u2022 **Broken.** One of the characters has been deeply wounded/traumatized from a past event. But perhaps when they meet their other half, they could help them find a way to heal their scars. Okay, quick thing to say about this one. I don\u2019t like it if love is automatically the solution to someone\u2019s mental trauma. That\u2019s not how that works. It can certainly help with it, but it\u2019s not a solution. I don\u2019t want some guy with anger issues suddenly start being nice just because he meets the girl of his dreams. They need to work through something like that together.\n\n\u2022 **Power Couple.** I thrive on seeing two powerful individuals who have a deep connection with one another and aren\u2019t just leeching off each other\u2019s power. Could be with a king and queen, or two villains, or anything really.\n\n\u2022 **Soulmates.** Two people who are destined to be together. Could be a fate thing, where destiny is literally like \u201cnow kiss,\u201d or it could be that the two are meant to be together for one reason or another.\n\nThat\u2019s all I got for now. If none of these appeal to you but you have your own idea in mind, feel free to tell me about it! This is only a handful that I came up with off the top of my head at 3 in the morning, but I\u2019m certain there are many others I would enjoy that I just haven\u2019t thought of.\n___________________________________________________\n\nHere are some basic requirements:\n\n1. **You must be 18 or older.** Simple and to the point.\n\n2. **You must have good grammar and be able to write a decent amount.** It doesn\u2019t need to be perfect, since spelling errors are inevitable, but just do the best that you can. Also, you don\u2019t need to be able to write me an essay, but don\u2019t send me one or two-liners either. In short, show me that you put in effort into your response.\n\n3. **There is no set time limit for responses.** Of course, I don\u2019t want to wait more than a week or a month just to receive one response, but you have no reason to rush if you are busy or need more time. I understand that sometimes real life needs more attention than the roleplay. (If I don\u2019t happen to respond for a while, I most likely just forgot about it or got distracted halfway through my reply, so feel free to remind me if I haven\u2019t responded.)\n\n4. **Please don\u2019t ghost me.** I know sometimes it can be an easy way out for people, hence why it happens so often, but if you\u2019re no longer enjoying the roleplay, please let me know. I want us both to enjoy roleplaying together. Communication is key.\n\n5. **I only roleplay on Discord**, so unfortunately if you don\u2019t have it, we won\u2019t be able to roleplay.\n\n6. **Out-of-character chatting.** This is less so a requirement and more of just a hope. It\u2019s nice just to get to talk to someone sometimes, even if it\u2019s about the randomest (autocorrect says that\u2019s not a word but I disagree) things. It\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t want to, but I just think it\u2019ll be more fun and make the roleplay even more enjoyable.\n___________________________________________________\n\nNow, if you read all that, congrats! Have a virtual cookie. If you\u2019re interested in roleplaying with me, send me a message telling me about yourself and what you\u2019re looking to roleplay. Include which idea you like (or if you have your own), which pairing(s) you like, and what type of character you plan to play. You don\u2019t need to give me every single detail about them, but I just like know what you have in mind before we get into anything. If you have any questions about the roleplay, feel free to send them my way as well.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you!",

I am:\n\n* 25+ years of age.  \n* Currently making the most of an uncertain situation and while gainfully employed, am working from home with a lot of extra time on my hands. \n* Located in CST. Open to trying to make schedules work, regardless of time zone. \n* A self-proclaimed setting nerd who has read the ASoIaF books and watched the HBO GoT series all the way to its painful conclusion. \n* A detail-oriented writer with years of rp experience. Adv/literate multi-paragraph to novella depending on the partner and my mood.\n* Open to writing canon characters or OC's, depending upon the partner and the prompt. \n* Third person only. \n* Discord preferred. \n\n#####With that said, I'm looking for a partner who is: \n\n* At least 21 years old. \n* Familiar with the setting/world and its characters. \n* A literate to advanced literate writer who understands the beauty of details.\n* Up for a long-term role-play.\n\n####At the moment, I've been wondering what would have happened if the Reach had allied with the North during the War of the Five Kings. **However, know that I am also open to brainstorming other storylines for other OC or canon combinations!** Below you will find a little prompt to set the scene for a Margaery x Robb RP. If interested, please reply in DM with: \n\n* A little bit about yourself **AND**\n* An in-character reply to the prompt, so that I can get a feel for your writing style, **OR**\n* A writing sample and more information about what you'd be interested in writing instead.\n\n&gt;####There are many maesters whose accounts of the War of the Five Kings in the annals of history will say that Catelyn Stark arrived too late to Bitterbridge, for the young, self-crowned King Renly Baratheon had already perished following the great melee in the Reach, a victim rumored to have run afoul of dark sorcery. There are still others, however, whose narratives will state that the great lady arrived in the South at precisely the moment that the New Gods meant for her to, for it would take them all in collusion to accomplish what the envoy set out to do. \n\n&gt;####The Crone, it is rumored, appeared to the Young Wolf in a dream, lighting the path that his mother was meant to tread from the Riverlands to the Reach. The Mother then kept Lady Stark company throughout the journey and long after her arrival into a camp overcome with equal parts grief and confusion once the Father had judged the youngest Baratheon unfit to bear the burden of a crown and the Stranger had whisked his soul away. Credit was no doubt due the Smith for the details of a plan that seemed inspired by the sudden change in the situation at hand, hatched between the matriarchs of Houses Stark and Tyrell in the hopes of bringing the rose\u2019s own maiden before the young King in the North to solidify an alliance that the Warrior would bless in the moons to come upon battlefields where wolves and roses would stand together. \n\n####Thanks again for reading my ad! Happy writing, everyone!",

            "selftext": "Hey there, Space Cowgirl!\n\nAn  unusual request, since I don't usually dabble in fandoms or anime,  really, but Cowboy Bebop has a special place in my heart now. I watched  it this year, so I'm quite fresh with it. I loved it from beginning to  end, but I'm still left with that yearn to see Spike alongside Faye,  romantically, of course.\n\nWe can start off right off the bat with the scene above, from the episode *The Real Folk Blues PT.2*.  Ideally, I'd prefer if my partner knew who Faye Valentine was, which  means that you must have watched the series to RP this prompt. I've  watched a few episodes twice here and there ever since I watched it  fully, but I'll definitely re-watch to freshen things up for this lovely  prompt.\n\nWe can also come up with a fresh start prompt if you have any other ideas. Maybe Spike does come back after killing Vicious?\n\nI  wanna find out what could've happened if Spike let go of the past,  somehow, biologically, mentally. Heck, let's say he doesn't die at all  after that glorious ***BANG!***  of his. I wanna know what love could sprout between Faye and Spike  aboard the Bebop as they hunt down bounties for a bunch of Woolongs.\n\nI'm an experienced writer. I've got 9 years of RP experience, at least. I'm 22.\n\nIf  you're interested, send me your FAVORITE Faye Valentine quote (it's a  must) as a Private Message (no chat) and talk to me about yourself,  about why you love Cowboy Bebop and tell me about your ideas for this  prompt, too. Cheers!",

            "selftext": "Hello, you can call me Sarah. I am in the market for an Original fantasy or apocalypse Roleplay, though I would be willing to write an OC in a fandom that I am familiar with.\n\n# How I Roleplay:\n\n\\- I write in third person, past tense when I roleplay. I tend to write about 500ish words per reply, but obviously that can fluctuate with what is going on in the story. In a Partner, I just ask that you don\u2019t give me one-liners, and help me drive the story. \n\n\\-I like to plan and talk OOC, I like to world-build as a team. My preference is discord, or possibly email. I would be willing to write over Google Docs, but would definitely have to have some type of messenger to talk OOC over. \n\n\\-I prefer playing female mains, though I have no problems playing male side characters. I am willing to double if you also are wanting to bring in a female main. \n\n\\- I am in EST but have a very odd sleep schedule so that doesn\u2019t matter all that much to me. I try to reply at the very least every other day, though, depending on the day and what I have going on I can reply multiple times a day. \n\n\\-I am 21+ so please be the same. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What I am looking for:\n\n\\-Fantasy, though I prefer high fantasy I would be willing to try new things. It can be something like the witcher, or lord of the rings. Or maybe you would like to go for a dystopian Victorian age fantasy. Also willing to do some horror fantasy, with a good old classic vampire/ demon story. \n\n\\-Apocalypse, whether it be zombie, or something else. Maybe aliens tapped the resources of the earth, leaving it a barren wasteland, or possible war. Feel free to throw in your own ideas, and let's build a world!\n\n\\-As far as possible fandoms: Dragon age, fairytail, bleach, Lucifer, there is probably more just nothing else coming to mind. So feel free to ask. \n\nSo if you have made it this far and you are interested, please feel free to DM me and we can get things in motion! \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",

            "selftext": "Hey! Like many of us I\u2019ve suddenly found myself with a bunch of free time and I\u2019m looking to fill some time with some roleplays. Here's a quick intro about me. I'm 28, female, and when I\u2019m not quarantined I work at a comic/game shop full time. I play a lot of dungeons and dragons and a lot of my writing involves characters/worlds I\u2019ve created for either my or my friend\u2019s campaigns. My favorite setting is fantasy, but I like a lot of grit/realism in my fantasy, grey morality, imperfect characters, weakness, all that fun stuff. I\u2019m a firm believer in the idea than a sword fight to the death should be a little terrifying no matter how good you are; and that if you fight 1 person vs 3 you\u2019re probably going to come out with injuries. \n\nI can write in both third and first person past, I think both have merits and I\u2019m up for either. While I mostly play women I can play men too. I have characters of lots of different sexualities/gender and it\u2019d be cool if you did too. While I\u2019m not really aiming for a NSFW game I also understand that sexuality can play a roll in storytelling/character development so I\u2019m not going to avoid it if it fits. That being said if that\u2019s all your looking for, maybe I\u2019m not the person for you.\n\nOn the more technical side of things I role-play at the advanced level. While I typically write long posts I also think a few good paragraphs can work fine on faster paced or dialog heavy situations. I\u2019m much more concerned with quality of character and writing than length. Quality is a big sticking point for me right now. I want to role-play with someone who matches and/or exceeds me. I will almost always ask to trade writing samples before we start planning anything. \n\nAs far as post frequency, since I\u2019m stuck inside at the moment I\u2019d love something daily or every few days. That being said I also don\u2019t mind a slower weekly or biweekly games. Of course that doesn\u2019t mean I won\u2019t be patient if there are delays, we all have lives. As mentioned above I usually work full time so when work starts back up I may be having some delays myself. I\u2019m not going to be super pushy as long as you don't ghost me. I\u2019m also not opposed to sharing multiple posts in a day if we get particularly inspired.\n\nSettings I\u2019m interested in the moment are mostly fantasy and variants on that. I have some pre-made worlds/lore for some of these settings and would be happy to share them with anyone interested. In the long run I'm more motivated by good characters than settings so feel free to suggest your own things too!\n\n* Medieval Fantasy (Classic, one of my own worlds, or something entirely different)\n* Gothic Horror (Monster hunters, Eldritch Horror, Bloodborne-esque &lt;3) (I have fleshed out world and many characters for this)\n* Modern Super Powers (This is one I actually have a fairly fleshed out setting for if interested, but it\u2019s less super hero oriented and more super powered people with problems.)\n* Steampunk (Let\u2019s be over the top airship pirates! Or Historical based settings with steampunk flair.)\n* Fandom Settings with Original Characters (The Witcher (Warning: I disregard the stupid rule that women can\u2019t be witchers), Lord of the Rings, Fallout, Saga, Star Trek)  \n\nI also love me some strong lady protagonists, and I\u2019m a sucker for angst and tragedy. So pitch away if you\u2019ve got an idea you think I might like.",

            "selftext": "\nHiyo! I'm looking for some fun partners! \n\n\n**Rules :**\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0Partners must be 18+, I'm 21 so no minors! Sorry!\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0Must be able to reply at least a few times each week. I don't need you to tell me your schedule or when you're going somewhere, but just need you to be able to commit to the movement of the story.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0Must be literate! I don't need every reply to have multiple paragraphs (not that I don't love it) but I do expect correct grammar and at least a few sentences.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0Must be nice! We don't have to be friends, but I am chatty soo...\n\n\ud83d\udcf7If we are going to be doing a Fandom story, please be upfront in telling me how complete your knowledge is of the subject. I like to be sort of detail oriented.\n\n**Guidelines :**\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0Off the bat, I don't play straight guys in romantic situations. The only time I will play a straight guy is if the character is fully needed, or romance isn't involved. Every time I try to play one, they turn into a jerk.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0Playing more than one character is fine. I will also double up if you want me to play a certain character, as long as I think I can play them.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0I love romance. I just do, I'm sappy like that. This being said, I don't like stories where they just automatically are in love. This has a few exceptions, but most likely won't happen unless the story idea is really good.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0I'm also interested in like family style stories, as far as non-romance goes.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0I like to add real life themes into my stories. This is one, because I like drama, and two, because perfect stories in perfect worlds are no fun.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0My only triggers are only triggers when portrayed incorrectly. These are mental health issues, invisible diseases, and suicide. I will call you out on these things and stop the story if they are misrepresented. This is because incorrect portrayal of these things is something I have to deal with on a daily basis. I call people out in real life too. Constantly.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0Speaking of the above point, I do get sick quite often. This is just more of a heads up.\n\n\n**Ships :**\n\n(My characters will be italicized.)\n\n(Asterix by stories I'm craving.)\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0Star Wars\n\n\\- *OC* x OC \\*\n\n\\- *OC* x Poe \\*\n\n\\- *OC* x Hux\n\n\\- *OC* x Kylo\n\n\\- *OC*\u00a0x Anakin\n\n\\-\u00a0*Hux* x Kylo\n\n\\- *Rey*\u00a0x Kylo\n\n\\- *Jyn* x Cassian \\*\n\n\\- *Finn* x Poe\n\n\\- *Padme* x Anakin\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0Star Trek\\*\n\n\\- *OC* x OC\n\n\\- *OC* x Jim\n\n\\- *OC* x Bones\n\n\\- *OC* x Scotty\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0Harry Potter\n\n\\- *OC* x OC\n\n\\- *OC* x Newt\n\n\\- Remus X *Sirius*\\*\n\n\\- *Queenie* X Jacob\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0Marvel\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\- *OC* x OC\n\n\\- *OC* x Hawkeye (Clint or Kate)\n\n\\- *Hawkeye (Kate)* x OC\n\n\\- *OC*\u00a0x Doctor Strange\n\n\\- *OC* x Bucky Barnes\n\n\\- *OC* x Charles Xavier\n\n\\- *OC* x Hank McCoy\n\n\\-\u00a0*Spider-Man* x Deadpool\n\n\\- *OC* x Daredevil (Comics)\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0DC\n\nMostly just looking for BatFam stories.\n\n*OC* x Jason Todd\n\n\ud83d\udcf7BBC\n\n\\-\u00a0 *OC* x Sherlock Holmes\n\n\\- *OC* x John Watson\n\n\\-\u00a0 *OC* x Mycroft Holmes\n\n\\-\u00a0 *OC* x 10th Doctor\n\n\\-\u00a0 *OC*\u00a0x 11th Doctor\n\n\\-\u00a0 *OC* x OC Doctor\n\n\ud83d\udcf7Others\n\n\\- *Roxas* x Axel (KH)\n\n\\- *OC*\u00a0x Spencer (Criminal Minds)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Story Ideas :**\n\n(None of my ideas are too formed, to allow us to make it our own.)\n\n\ud83d\udcf7General Ideas That I'm Always Into\n\n\\-Modern Day AUs\n\n\\-Non-Modern AUs\n\n\\-Anything Cute Really\n\n\\-Canon-Divergent Stories that have basis in a Canon event\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0Star Wars\n\n\\-Matchmaker B.B.8 \\*\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 A story where our good pal beebee-ate accidentally acts as a matchmaker.

I\u2019ll most likely come off kinda negative and unfriendly in this post, but I promise I\u2019m not. I\u2019m just kinda over people wasting my time and energy, so I\u2019m going to be very clear as to what I do \\*not\\* want as well as what I\u2019m looking for.\n\nGUIDELINES:\n\n\\- 2 day limit. I\u2019m an active writer. It\u2019s fine if something comes up, just tell me. I will always ask if something is going on, but I\u2019m not about to do it 20 times x) If I can\u2019t make the two day limit, I\u2019ll let you know. If you know you can't manage a 2 day limit at least 97% of the time, I'm not your guy.\n\n\\- At least 10 sentences per reply. The longer the better.\n\n\\- 3rd person. No text talk. Proper English.\n\n\\- MxM pairings only. I don't care about your real-life gender ; )\n\n\\- Genres I write are; romance, slice of life, drama, angst.\n\n\\- You must be 18+ in real life. I include youknowhat content in my roleplays.\n\n\\- I'm strictly interested in manly characters - looks and personality-wise. This doesn't mean that your character can't be unsure or isn't supposed to feel anything, but I'm not into extremely shy, anti-social or feminine characters\n\n\\- Real-life face claims only that match the criteria above.\n\n\\- Characters I play are usually between 23 - 29 age-wise.\n\n\\- I'm the master of plots. Honestly, I can suck them right out of my thumb. However, this usually means I'm coming up with all the ideas and what not; I love it when I'm not the only one thinking about the plots since we're writing it together after all! Don't be shy about your ideas because I'd love to hear about them.\n\n\\- If you're someone who can't be honest when they don't like someone and would rather ghost than talk about it, don't add me. Start the msg you send me with \u2018ice cream\u2019 to prove you\u2019ve read this properly ; )\n\nIf you're interested in writing, please shoot me an introduction through pms here.\n\nHappy writing! : D",

If you do send me a Chat Request &gt; PM, replies can be scarce and even not existent. So again, please PM. c:\n\nHi there! Thanks for taking a look at my advertisement!\n\nMy name's Kyle, I'm 20, English and I'm currently looking for some RP partners to write some cool and original stories! Before I say about what I like to roleplay, allow me to introduce myself and my likes.\n\n\u2022 I'm currently 20, so I'm looking for someone 18+. This is mainly due to the fact that my RPs can NSFW in parts and I just wanna make sure no trouble comes of it.\n\n\u2022 I'm currently only looking for FEMALE RP Partners. I do apologize if this offends anyone of the male/trans community. Its just my personal preference. I'd also ask that you're fairly active too. A couple of posts a day at least.\n\n\u2022 I like a partner who's detailed and experienced. Fine, quickfire posts can be shorter, but I like quality in my posts. I'm not asking for half a novel though. There's such a thing as too little and too much detail. Also, I RP in THIRD person only. Again, just my preference, however, I am more than welcome for you to use third/first at your own desire. I also play OC Characters only as well. I don't find it entertaining to play a Canon Character. I don't mind them appearing as side characters but the main story players will be OC x OC.\n\n\u2022 Finally, I like people who are interested in the same things as myself. Please understand what my RP is being based on. I offer a variety so there's plenty to choose from.\n\nRight! Now I have my expectations out of the way, here are the things I'm looking for RP story wise!\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n- Halo : Halo has always been a number one fandom that I have loved to Rp in the past but have never really found someone perfect for the role. So for this RP, I can do alot of different themes/pairings so long as, said later, that the characters are indeed OC.\n\n- Destiny : Exactly the same as Halo, I absolutely love this game. To the point where I am a Lore Nerd as well as a Sherpa. I would love to find someone who would want to delve into the stories behind the game and the hundreds of years of lore prior to the first game beginning.\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nI hope you all enjoyed what I've produced and I hope that I get some responses fairly soon! Thanks again for taking the time to read my post! See you soon!",

            "selftext": "Hi there! I\u2019ve posted on here before about trying to find a Beetlejuice roleplayer, but I figured this time I\u2019d be a bit more specific.\n\nLet me start out by listing some things that are important to know that I headcanon or don\u2019t want to include:\n\n-This is *not* a romance roleplay. Betelgeuse is hundreds of years old at least and Lydia is underaged. That route is uncomfortable to me.\n\n-Since it\u2019s said several times in the musical, I headcanon Betelgeuse as a demon rather than a ghost. I also headcanon that he\u2019s never actually been human and has some difficulty relating to them in certain aspects.\n\n-I\u2019d really love to have someone at least literate. I don\u2019t care so much about replies being long as I do care about them adding content to the roleplay and pushing the story forward.\n\nAnyway, my idea is that after messing with Lydia, Betelgeuse is put on trial in the Netherworld courthouse. Clearly, being banished and made invisible wasn\u2019t enough of a punishment, so they then decide to make him human to force him to experience how much being mortal sucks to learn the impact of his destructive choices. Not knowing what to do with himself, he seeks out Adam and Barbara and is begrudgingly reunited with Lydia and stressful hilarity ensues.\n\nIf you\u2019ve only watched the original film, please keep in mind hat there\u2019s a difference in the characters from the musical adaptation! However, I\u2019d love to hear from someone interested in playing Lydia. Thanks!",

With COVID-19 having the world practically shut down and my classes online, I'm finding the need for something to preoccupy me. As a clear disclosure, however, my classes are time consuming and I still only can write a few replies a day during the week!\n\nI only write using Discord!\n\nMy style of writing is third-person, past-tense paragraph(s). My quantity varies with the plot and the scene in the plot. Dialogue is generally shorter; however, I am not against writing three to four paragraphs if the moment in the plot calls for it. I will not write with anyone who uses first person.\n\nI will write any gender in any pairing; however, I am leaning towards female in a M/F pairing. I am comfortable with writing NSFW themes but I ask that you are eighteen or older because I don't particularly like the idea of going to jail.\n\nMy plots will always include romance because I absolutely adore it and I will never tire of writing it. However, I am particularly fond of slowburn romance as frustrating as it can become! The genres I am searching for are post-apocalypse or slice-of-life. I don't shy away from the dark and gritty themes either. Throw me all the angst and pain. I absolutely love discussing plot and characters.\n\nI'm really searching for some strong, confident characters!\n\nI'm currently searching for some plots but I'm open to more but I will absolutely LOOOOVE you if you give me one of these\n\n\u2022 A 'country boy' romance aesthetic because I've been listening too far too much Taylor Swift recently\n\n\u2022 Possibly could get behind a post-apocalyptic feel plot\n\n\u2022 A rebel boy and rich girl aesthetic\n\n\u2022 Long distance relationship !!\n\n\u2022 Shamless atmosphere !! I don't do canon charas tho, just the gritty life of them\n\n\u2022 Cute cliches are my weakness\n\n\u2022 Single young mom with a kid\n\nBring me your plots, too!\n\nI don't know if I missed anything. Chances are I did. However, if my post intrigues you, feel free to send me a little orange envelope!\n\nHope to hear from y'all soon!",

            "selftext": "Hello everoyne! I'm looking for a RP where my partner plays an elf or another fantasy race. \\[humanoid, please don't bring mermaids and such to the table.\\] Whether they're common, nearly extinct, or a middle ground is up to them. We can discuss different types over PMs. Though I may also be open to other 'fantasy' based races, so feel free to ask! I would prefer romance involved, though it is far from a requirement. Please note for romance I only do MxF in which I play M.\n\nAs for the setting/world. I would love an AU of earth/our world, but am open to creating brand new ones. Locations such as cities, towns, \\[other planets?\\], and more are all up to us, so don't feel the need to be stuck with what we have currently! As for timeline wise, preferably something set modern or post-modern, though I am just as open to a medieval/fantasy setting as well!\n\nPlot can be discussed between us, if you have any ideas, feel free to shoot them over. If not don't worry, I do have a couple ideas in mind!\n\nI can do novella length in terms of post/reply length, but I will generally adjust to my partners average post size.\n\nFinally here is some series that have some elements and aspects I'd love to take inspiration from, though are in no way the only things we are barred to. Please note I am not an active viewer/reader/etc of all the ones mentioned, though I know enough about them to use as examples somewhat.\n\n\\- Deadly Class\n\n\\- The Order\n\n\\- The Witcher\n\n\\- Kakegurui\n\n\\- Devilman Crybaby\n\n\\- Game of Thrones\n\n\\- The Magicians\n\n\\- Stranger Things\n\n\\- Channel Zero\n\n\\- Newman\n\n\\- Chilling Adventures of Sabrina\n\n\\- Lord of the Rings\n\n\\- Yamada and the Seven Witches\n\n\\- Riverdale\n\n\\- My Hero Academia\n\nI hope those help give an idea, though I honestly wouldn't rely on them solely. As I said, all things are up for debate, and I hope to hear from you all! If you are interested simply message me!\n\nAs for me, I'm currently living on the east coast of the United States. My timezone is EST! I generally reply quickly and love chatting OOC!",

            "selftext": "Aristotle said that the plot of the story is central, while the characters are on the peripheries. The characters are the means to which the end is achieved; they are agents, nodes, drivers of the plot, but the plot is greater than them. The story is the overarching structure and the characters are secondary. Story-driven over character-driven is how I write. For this reason, I will be playing both male/female characters.  \n\nCommunication is key, and I reply reasonably often unless something were to come up. I write multi-paragraph responses that go past Discord's character limit at times. All I ask is that you give things your all and have all the fun you want. \n\nThe kind of story I'd like to create with you is not your ordinary story. It is an *extraordinary* story. It is a philosophical, psychological, spiritual, thrilling story. A story packed with adventure, with diabolical fantasy, with glass-breaking action, and murderous mystery. It is a story that explores Pandemonium, a story that travels through the magical world of King Arthur, a story that descends into the heart of darkness, a story of death and destruction dealing with the profoundest questions of life.\n\nHere is the plot summary of what I have in mind:\n\n&gt; A miraculous island had emerged from the sea without rhyme or reason. The island was so strange that all the world's governments had announced a unilateral quarantine so that scientists could study this vast island, free of tourist interference. No one was allowed in, and the navy had set up a blockade to keep any sightseers away.\n\n&gt; The mysterious island spawned more conspiracy theories than anything in the history of civilization. The most common conspiracy was that the island was where the Illuminati would build their New World Order and take over the world. The New Age industry went into overdrive, saying how that the island was alive, breathing like Gaia, the mother of Earth, and that everyone had a duty to become One with this undefined entity. Among others, rumor had it that the island was the long-lost Atlantis. Some claimed it was Hyperborea, the paradise of the Greek mythos where the sun never set. Social media had seized the zeitgeist and the name Lyonesse stuck, the famous kingdom of King Arthur which was said to have sunk exactly in the same place where this mysterious island appeared.\n\n&gt; Whatever the truth was, one fact remained certain: it was a home for a mysterious killer who became known as the Mistletoe Madman. It was claimed that the same sacred plant, the mistletoe, was being used by this killer who slayed the government's researchers. With each grotesque murder, a mistletoe sprig was left behind, as a macabre marking of the killer's monstrous modus operandi. The maniac was said to be hiding on the island, harnessing its magical powers to destroy the world. And it's up to the search and rescue team to stop him.\n\nTo reach heaven, you have to go through outer heaven. Do you have what it takes to face your fears? Are you ready to leave this world and go to the Otherworld?",

My only real requirement is that you use Discord, are over the age of 18, and are literate enough to write a few paragraphs worth of writing! I dislike one-liners with a heated passion unless necessary for the plot!\n\n1.) Star Wars (Specifically Clone Wars or the Galactic Civil War - I'll be using either an ARC Trooper or a Shadow Trooper!) \n\n2.) Half Life (I love the games. You'll start to see a trend of me wanting to shove in OCs.) \n\n3.) Halo (OCs, naturally but I don't mind if you want to play a canon character!) \n\n4.) Wolfenstein (Mainly OCs) \n\n5.) Doom (I'd say OCs but I'm curious to see if I could play the Doom Slayer) \n\n6.) Or anything action based! It can range from the apocalypse, the Military, something simple and easy to get into! I have OCs for them.\n\nIn terms of pairings, I'd prefer to stay MxF but I myself may be able to play a female for any other pairing involving that OC.. I also ask that my partners be able to post at least 1-2 times a day but I understand if life gets to you! OOC contribution is also something I'd like to add in, just to add input to plot or suggestions for things!\n\nSo romance is a thing and I don't expect it to be IMMEDIATE and sudden. But if it is, I don't mind! Just that we throw curves and epic vices to make things cooler!\n\nFor Note: If I don't get to adding you back on Discord immediately, I'll get to you soon! Life is a thing, of course!\n\nPlease PM your Discord and possibly what you're interested in writing! I hope to see you soon!",

About 7 months ago, a girl I had been actively roleplaying with, every day for about 4 years was diagnosed with cancer, and she hung up her hat and we said our goodbyes. So it\u2019s time for me to find a new partner. To go on all sorts of adventures! \n\nHere is an about me section\n\nI am a funny, witty person who enjoys talking a lot, however my roleplay style is more fast paced. About 1-2 actions with quick dialogue. (In my 7 year or so experience, I find this works best for action roles so fights and such are more equal, instead of someone else telling me what\u2019s going on)\n\nI have an emphasis on adventure, but romance is always really fun. Seeing it develop between two characters can be really interesting and fun to watch!\n\nI can do so many roles... from short term romance to long term. To short term to long term adventure. All sorts of movies/tv shows \n\nHere are some of my favorites!\n\nHarry Potter/Star Wars/medieval/War/sports related. \n\nThey\u2019re a bit broad but there\u2019s so much to be discovered, and I\u2019m always happy to support you and do roles you like! \n\nI\u2019m also someone that will care about you as a human. As much as I want good roleplay, I also want good friendship! Good RP turns into great RP with friendship!\n\nLet me know if you\u2019re interested. I can communicate by kik/discord and whatnot. And I hope you have an awesome day!\n\nThanks Reddit!",

I don't have many requirements other than that you be female, are literate, and are cable of a decent amount of detail. I, myself, have been roleplaying since I was fairly young, eight or so years, so I am comfortable adapting to the majority of people's styles/preferences. \n\nI have an idea in mind, that I will go more in depth with if you choose to DM me. That idea will be a mixture of fantasy, drama, romance, and a tinge of slice of life. If that peaks your instrest, please shoot me a DM! It would be helpful if you had a decent amount of knowledge of anime tropes and such as well as it follows a similar style.\n\nThanks for reading!",

I'm situated in the GMT+1 zone, but am currently up late often.\n\nI have a deep rooted love for anything fantasy, no matter in what kind of setting - Currently I do lean more towards the urban setting, but I am absolutely open to your ideas! Other genres include postapocalyptic and science fiction (if there's a great plot and set of characters).Romance, especially slow burn, is welcome, but smut will only be handled with fade to black. \n\nCurrently I have also been itching for something in the BNHA world. Mind you, I am not completely caught up with the show yet, so I might not know about everything.\n\nI prefer F/M for main pairings - and I have a cast of women I really like to play as well. There'll also be a lot of other characters though, which brings me to my next point - If you're looking for a whole story revolving just around our MCs with no other in depth character building, then I am not the gal for you.\n\nStill here? Great! What I want in a partner: I am looking for somebody literate, who took their time reading all of this. I prefer writers that have good grammer - note good, not perfect. English is my third language and I will make mistakes, so if some happen to you now and then, I won't mind at all. I only write 3rd person past tense, no discussion. I love OOC chat and to make friends with people over a shared story and I promise I'm way more easy going and nice than it probably seems in this ad. Please be communicative and let me know if you have to leave for a week or if you're not interested. I promise, I won't go bonkers over it.I'll notice quickly enough if you haven't and might not respond. This especially concerns people just sending empty chat invitations or messages as, but not limited to: \"hey\", \"i want to rp with u\" - and the like. Please introduce yourself, let me know what kind of story or genre would interest you most and if you have any plot or character you're totally itching to write, tell me about it!\n\nI use Discord for roleplaying, as it is easy and handy to use and organize servers.\n\nSo, hope to hear from you! DM me if I've gained your interest.",

            "selftext": "Preamble: hey, my character is Sukianne Yakitta Fondrian. I'm looking for a superhero to my supervillain. Can be OC or fandom character. \nTrigger warning: my roleplays contain gore, themes of violence, actual violence.\nLiterate, please work with me when I ask for 3+ sentences!\nAnyways, Preamble over\n\nHero or villain or neutral: villain\n\nname: Sukianne -Yakitta Fondrian\n\nCode name/villain name: Doctor S\n\nAge: 32\n\nGender: female\n\nAppearance: dark blue hair waist length, blue eyes, 5'9\" , a bit curvy (she's had 2 kids), Villain Costume is wearing a stereotypical mad scientist high-collared shirt, black dress pants, and black goggles. Civilian clothes are a simple white sundress during the day, or when she's \"out on the town\" a short black dress. (Villain costume ref https://www.rpnation.com/data/avatars/o/79/79830.jpg?1585890679 ((credit to CathyButera_Loser on ig)))\n\nPowers/abilities: Dead eye (she can almost always hit her target, as long as she's focused.)\n\nWeapons(optional): scalpels and throwing knives\n\nWeaknesses: her two children (twins Yukio and Will, age 6),she falls in love too easily, can be distracted quite easily.\n\nBackstory: Sukianne Yakitta Fondrian graduated top of her class in Fondrian Academy in the Medical Sciences division. She quickly became a wonderful and renowned doctor. Then, she was caught experimenting with and operating on stolen cadavers, and her medical licence was revoked. She acted ashamed in public. The only thing she really regretted was how she was caught. She wouldn't be able to get cadavers and patients as easy now! She began to train not only her body, but her charm. She needed more people. More experiments. She soon found out, even blindfolded and backwards, she could hit a bullseye from 50 yards away if she concentrated. But as soon as she lost focus, she couldn't be farther from the center of her targets. She dressed up, and went out. She fohnd a desperate woman, desiring to be more beautiful. With whispered promises and charming, reassuring smiles, the woman was soon in the labratory underneither Suki's home. Putting the woman under, she smiled. She would begin her experiments.\nSuki found this new power addicting. Her patients were responsive, especially when they woke. This was much better than cadavers. So much better...\nEventually, her charm stopped working. People were getting scared of strangers promising things to get them in the promiser's home.\nSuki resorted to kidnapping. Witnesses were scarce, most being found stabbed or deeply cut. There were whispers, and then talk, and then screams of a mad doctor. An anonymous tipper for a newspaper got her name.\nDoctor S.\nSuki beamed at the newspaper headline as she sat in the cafe.\nShe looked up from the newspaper.\nWho should she experiment on tonight?",

But I believe that my love for RP only transferred itself into what i\u2019m currently studying; cinema and communication. I love storytelling and making a scenario in my head come true. With your help, I hope to be able to create a universe where we can enjoy ourselves and share a beautiful meaningful moments between players.\n\nHere\u2019s a broad list of things I enjoy RPing: complex characters, backstories, memorable NPCs, modern scenarios, teenage tumblr aesthetic (euphoria, skins, etc), sci-fi, magic, witches. \n\nHere\u2019s things I dislike: *heavy* use of fandom (not Larry Stylinson please,) get to the heat straight at the beginning, let\u2019s slow burn it a bit! Meta-gaming, medieval RPs, and Mary Sues.\n\nOf course if you have also an idea I haven\u2019t cited, please let me know more. I would love to see what you can come up with! \n\nYou can DM me, i\u2019m also available on discord!",

I'm looking for a roleplay partner that's male and older than 18, as I'm over 18 and don't feel comfortable with minors. I'm semi-literate, and I have roughly 8 years of experience, with breaks in between. I'd like my partner to be semi-literate as well, and I prefer quality over quantity. While I usually do at least 1-2 paragraph replies, I'm primarily looking at quality.\n\nI do have a couple ideas for a plot, both werewolf related, but I love most genres! I love medieval, fantasy, slice of life, romance, supernatural, and more! I've never done historical fiction, sci-fi, and a few others though I'd be willing to try them out! I don't like fandom or celebrity plots, as I like things to be as original as possible, though I know it can be difficult. I'll allow smut, but I'd like it to be part of the story, and I'd like it to have a decent amount of build up before hand. I prefer to roleplay here.

            "selftext": "Alright, here\u2019s the thing. I\u2019ve been doing The Hunger Games Roleplays for quite sometime. Longer than I\u2019d like to admit, even. I have even writen a fan fiction or two on the books. I don\u2019t know what is it about them that keeps drawing me back, even after all these years. And thankfully for my teenager-self, back when I was obsessed about the books, the movies, you name it, millions of other people were too. So it wasn\u2019t that hard to find others to roleplay with. But now, it\u2019s become somewhat of a nearly impossible task. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m here, rambling and hoping that someone will listen.\n\nAnnie Cresta and Finnick Odair mean a whole lot to me. Even though Collins didn\u2019t spend as much time writing about the couple as I\u2019d like, I couldn\u2019t help but fall in love with them. THG has become more about them to me, than anything else. Which is why I keep trying to roleplay them, so that I can get the fascinating stories the books were never able to provide me.\n\nSo that\u2019s pretty much the deal here. I\u2019m tying to find someone to do a long-term, overly detailed and descriptive Odesta roleplay. Is it something pretty impossible and even pathetic to do, 7 freaking years after the first movie came out? Probably. Am I still going to try? You bet your ass I will.\n\nThat\u2019s pretty much it. Side note, I would be playing Annie. Funny enough (considering she\u2019s barely talked about in the books) she is one of my favorite characters, in general, not just in the books. \n\nAbout me:\n\n* I am 21 years old and have been roleplaying on and off for around 7 years. My old Reddit profile was deleted a while back so I had to create a new one.\n* My timezone is GMT-3, I\u2019ll let you know my schedule in our initial conversations but I will say that with the current sittuation, I\u2019m available most of the day.\n* I prefer third person and decent grammar. English is not my first language so I undarstand minor mistakes might happen. \n* I can write anywhere from two to an infinite number of paragraphs, just depends on the situation and what I\u2019m given off but I would like replies to be on the longer side.\n* I don\u2019t have any triggers but please let me know if you do!\n\nAnd a little bit mote about the roleplay:\n\n* Since there isn\u2019t much background content on Annie and Finnick, I would like us to discuss a bit about the characters story so that we are on the same page.\n* There is an infinite world of possibilities here but I generally tend to start these roleplays either right after Annie is reaped or after she is rescued from the Capitol in Mockingjay. Since I do want this to be longterm, though, I\u2019d love to start even before those situations as well. If you got this far, please include your favorite color in the first message you send me.\n* Finnick is a male character but I am open to everyone who is willing to roleplay as him.\n* I also expect you to be able to play other characters that might come up throughout the roleplay, as will I! Characters such as Snow, Mags, OC\u2019s etc.\n* 18+ only. Given the plot of the roleplay, there will be moments where NSFW content is required (mostly violence but some other topics as well). Smut is not required. Much to the contrary, although I am not completely adverse to it, I don\u2019t depend on it either. Given the plot, though, smut-related topics tend to come up. \n* E-mail is preferred, but I am open to other platforms as well.\n\nI think that\u2019s pretty much it. Please PM me if you\u2019re interested letting me know a little bit more about yourself and why you're interested in this roleplay.",

            "selftext": "Yello. Looking to RP on discord if anyone\u2019s up for it! \nI do FxF, FxM, or MxM, but in FxM I prefer to play as F. \nI write a pretty average, somewhat literate amount? Usually shadow the amount my writing partner does, but I do prefer lengthy replies. One-Liners, or anything near or under 4/5 lines probably won\u2019t work for me. Maybe just message me and we can figure it out. \n\nI had a plot idea though (Only open for FxF or MxM pairings), if you\u2019re up for it. This is simply a suggestion, so if you have one of your own, please tell me! I\u2019d imagine i\u2019m up for it, as i said i\u2019m bored asf. The Idea also holds some possibly dark materials, all the nitty gritty stuff. Just a warning. \nIncase you\u2019d rather avoid that, then message me and we\u2019ll figure out something different! \n\nThe Plot basically follows two characters in a strictly catholic countryside boarding school (Either all girls or all boys, based on the decided pairing) very \u2018traditional\u2019 in the sense that they\u2019re raising picture-perfect children, and have a vocal disgust of same-gendered relationships. \nOur characters are of course gay, and find them self attracted to each other? The RP would follow how they deal with the situation and the obstacles they end up facing. We can further flesh out the idea in chat, if you\u2019d like.\n\nAdult elements could be included, so +18 please. \nIf you\u2019re not up for the above plot idea, I\u2019d be up for something else! I enjoy many more genres than slice of life; Fantasy, Supernatural, Sci-Fi, Horror, blah blah blah.\n\nJust PM me and we\u2019ll sort something out.",

Hit me up if you're interested in writing with me! Either chat or orange mail is fine by me. \n\nThanks for reading!",

            "selftext": "&gt;When tensions rise between gangs, the leader of the most powerful and dangerous group makes an effort to protect his free-spirited daughter from becoming collateral. Even though they have a rocky, complicated relationship, she is the only thing he cares for, so he assigns her a bodyguard -- a notoriously skilled hitman with no allegiances... Until he develops a soft-spot for the girl.\n\nHey there! I'm looking for a partner to play the daughter in this RP. My posts keep getting taken down so I'm making this shorter, but I have a few ideas fleshed out for the plot. I'm looking for someone interested in contributing to the conflict, playing additional minor characters, and designing the plot with me! Please keep these things in mind:\n\n\\- 18+ only\n\n\\- Literate to advanced literate. I enjoy RPs with long, immersive posts that focus on character emotions and development (4-5+ paragraphs), but this also depends on context (combat RP is much shorter). **Please send me writing samples!**\n\n\\- **Romance isn't the main focus.** I get really bored with romance-heavy RPs! The conflict, violence, and plot are the main focus of the story, and the romance will be slow-burn and forbidden (but oh-so-yummy when it happens). At the beginning, the less the main characters like each other, the better!\n\n\\- Comfortable using face-claims, character bios, location REFs, etc. I use Discord for this purpose, and I tend to be thorough when designing my RPs. This one isn't super world-building heavy, though!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Please send me a detailed response if you're interested.** Tell me a bit about yourself, the character you intend to play/design, and please show me some examples of your writing! **The more specific, the more likely I am to be interested.** I say all of this because I had a hard time managing the messages last time!!! Ask me any questions you like. :)",

I have a lot of experience roleplaying but I prefer to do it to pass the time rather than as a main hobby.\n\nI prefer to roleplay fandoms, although I am willing to try to do a different type of roleplay if it interests me. I tend to like modern fantasy types of worlds where the rules are different from our usual life. I want a lot of interesting scenarios that can be written uniquely.\n\nSlice of life and historical rps are not my thing. If you're into that, I'm not for you. Also, I want a SFW rp. Romance plots are a bit too cliche for me. (Bonus points if you're a gamer)My favorite franchises are:\n\nSonic (Where I started RPing)\n\nRWBY (New interest.)\n\nTMNT (2003)\n\nSuper Mario (Particularly Paper Mario)\n\nSpongebob",

Whilst speaking to you I start rapidly developing a crush, though I play it cool and take things slow with playful flirting. \n\nThere are a few ways we could take it from here; \n\nEither I leave the \u201cpopular boy\u201d lifestyle to pursue you and we become a private couple who do our own thing and mess around together \n\nOR \n\nI start dating you and bring you to peak popularity with me, making you and me the most desired students in the school. Everyone knows us, everyone wants to be us.\n\nThings may (or may not, things might stay PG) advance to a sexual level. If so, we do it in places like classrooms, various places in school, our bedrooms whilst trying to avoid parents and that sort of thing. We adhere to the roleplay scenario, nothing too extreme.\n\nDM me introducing yourself and I\u2019ll respond if I like your message!\n\nSidenote: I know it\u2019s just a roleplay/story and not real but I\u2019m not up for roleplaying a romantic relationship with someone who\u2019s doing it behind their boyfriends/husbands back. That\u2019s weird to me and makes me uncomfortable.",

            "selftext": "Best friends turn into more (F4M)\n\nThere\u2019s something special about the idea, growing up together, going through puberty and both becoming stunning- handsome and muscular, busty and curvy. People, even parents, eager for you to date...but you can\u2019t seem to figure out just yet that the way you feel for each other isn\u2019t just the love of friends. Starting to notice those soft lips as she spoke or her noticing those grey sweatpants. Loud music playing in the background of some college party, beers being passed around and kissing making you realise actually- this is love.\nHowever there\u2019s a twist, no parents, no high school, your parents died early into your life , and you were taken into a government centre, beginning training and finishing at age 18, though still living in apartments near the site...but now with more freedom. They called it Operation BlueBird- the logo put onto all your kit.\n\nNow 18, flirty and having shared some kisses with easier girls. Suzie- your friend- now starting to relax and take her head out of her books and come out and party, whether it is sneaking out to a river in a bikini with drinks, or sneaking into your room in the 4 bed apartment block because she hated to sleep on her own, it was clear now your feelings weren\u2019t friendship- you wanted her...and somewhat known to you, due to her poor flirting, she wanted you. \n\nAnd so comes a introduction into dating, the two friends making out, having their first times with each other, going out on dates and having drunken fun- as well as all the cosy cute things associated with dating.",

Some big ones I am into are Borderlands, My Hero Academia, Ozark, Supernatural, Attack on Titan, Yu Yu Hakusho, and Resident Evil. If we go fandom, I am open to mc x oc and doubling!\n\n- I like talking in OOC to build our plot/world and cause it\u2019s fun!\n\n- I prefer reddit PMs or Google docs\n\n- I am anywhere from literate to advanced depending on what you give me. I definitely prefer at least a few paragraphs to work with.\n\n- Almost everything is doable; that is to say, I have few limits. Dark themes are fun to explore!

You\u2019re family having you come work for me to pay the bills in theyre home as they cannot afford it themselves. And so, you work for me. Yet, you end up getting in for more than expected \n\n\n2: You are a princess/prince (depending) and i am the new body guard. Going along an adventure with you to come out to another kingdom for paper documents and come back. How ever the trip doesn\u2019t go according to plan and we are forced to resort in an abandoned shack for a few days whilst i fix the carriage\n\n\n\u2014\n\nI would really like for these to be longterm and have a buildup \n\nI hope this intrigues you hun! \n\nTalk soon!

So my partner and characters must be 21+! I play canon characters and OC\u2019s and play M/M and F/F. Though this time I'm looking for M/M. Length of responses ranges, but minimum for me is one solid paragraph. Would love it if we could plot and contribute with ideas for the RP!\n\nAnyway, about the fandoms. I'm on the mood for somewhat unconventional settings.\n\n* **Genderbent Lore Olympus.** Haven't finished it and I'm not caught up, but we could follow the plot or go along with your ideas! \n* **Saint Seiya-based.** They put the classic episodes on Netflix, so I had to give it a watch and relive my childhood. Man does it have its moments! I'd love to play around with that. Canon characters in an AU, slow pacing through the early story, stuff of the sort, I'm game!\n* **Kyoshi/benders.** So I'm reading the book! It's quite nice so far, though I'm not even halfway trough, I'd like to play something along those lines. Either with the characters portrayed in the book or with OC's around this era of the lore. I'd love to hear your ideas.\n* **Raven Cycle.** I'd seriously love this. Most experienced with playing as Ronan.\n* **BOTW.** Probably the most popular of the stuff I'm looking for. Not yet finished with the game, but I'd love to play as a completely oblivious Link relentlessly opening a path to his goal. Your character would perhaps help him along gently or could be there to hinder him and then have a change of heart. I'm very interested in hearing what you'd come up with!\n* **There's also:** Borderlands 3?  Rick and Morty? Sailor Moon? \n\nI'd love to hear from you if you're interested!\n\nThanks for reading!",

            "selftext": "Hello there everyone. My name is Asphyre, and I'm searching for anyone wanting to partner up for my roleplay concept called 'Proxima Eudaimonia'. You can read more about it in this [Google Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P6PoR0lEjkuG-Zlej6z4h4G-TUBoDul5SvZrn5qqDTc/edit?usp=sharing), though I must stress that what you find there does not express the entire extent of the lore. I can share more if you're interested, but I'll move onto what the concept generally entails.\n\nProxima Eudaimonia is not your typical science fiction or post-apocalyptic story. It's set on a coastal island province on another planet ahead in the distant future. Technology is familiar, though noticeably different in specific instances. What you'll find is that travel is mostly done on foot or horseback for your common man. In addition to that, the radio is the main form of communication with floppy discs used as the only way to share information digitally other than using an intranet.\n\nColonies, outposts and other populated spaces are scattered and receive their administration from corporations that invest in their infrastructure and more. Our characters come from the modern-day as we know it. They land on this province, and it's up to them to survive through any means necessary until they reach the capital colony where they can acquire a more contemporary lifestyle.\n\nTheir story does not end when they reach the capital as they will need to pay off their debt to the corporation, which brought them to the planet. They can either work under one of nine legitimate companies that operate within the province, engage freelance contracts or turn to crime. Outside of the capital and most colonies, there is a cruel world riddled with many bad human elements that can either be evaded or embraced.\n\nWith that out of the way, I'll share some details about myself. For the basics, I'm 20 with almost an entire decade of roleplay experience. I'm pretty much online for most of the day given the current circumstances, but outside of that, I'm open for roleplay and chatter from around 5 PM - 12 AM and 9 AM - 12 AM (EST).\n\nMy roleplay is pretty detail-oriented as a result of my experience and personal taste. I usually post around 500 - 2000 characters per post (third-person past tense), the amount highly depends on the context associated with the roleplay.\n\nEverything from grammar to formatting is top-notch on my end since quality is my utmost priority. I can post every 5 - 15 minutes nonetheless, but this also depends on the context.\n\nSome other things to consider is that a moderate or potentially high amount of NSFW content is desired (further details can be shared in private). I also offer up music and incorporate visuals into my posts for immersion. I should also mention that my roleplay concept can get very gritty due to certain aspects of the world. Still, there are also fun and light-hearted moments that I think you'll appreciate.\n\nLastly, I need someone capable of matching my pace, quality and motivation alongside being 18+ and comfortable playing a female character. If that sounds good to you, then feel free to message or chat to me in private on Reddit. We can then exchange usernames and get started on Discord.\n\nThank you for reading and stay safe.",

            "selftext": "The diverse crowd filled Castletown as the many vendors set up shop for the day. There were farmers that traveled far from home to sell their recently harvested crops and Gerudo women trying to sell some jewelry they crafted. As a Hylian man was... enthralled with one of the Gerudos showing off the jewelry she had made, he didnt notice a young girl of Rito decent glide right behind him. As the girl moved between the people of Castletown, a small rock ball rolled after her, following her with great speed. \n\nThis time, unlike the Rito girl elegantly weaving between the crowd, the rock ball rolled forwards, almost targeting the girl as the people jumped out of the way. In a swift moment, the girl was snatched from the air by a feathery hand. She shut her eyes until her movement ceased and it was her mother giving her a discerning look, before turning to look at the rock ball heading their way before a giant beige hand grabbed the ball and threw it into the air. The ball uncurled and revealed it was just a Goron boy, which was then caught by the hand that threw him up in the air, his father. The two parents looked at each other and then at their children, both giving a look that can only be described as \"oops\" to their parents.\n\nHello there! I appreciate you taking the time out of your day to look at this post and I hope it you stick around to read more! Maybe even send a message if you would like!\n\nSo essentially, this RP is intended to take place in Breath of the Wild just before the destruction caused by the guardians going out of control and the great Calamity. However, this can potentially take place in other Zelda timelines like Ocarina of Time and so on. The games im most Familiar with are Ocarina of time, Breath of the Wild and Majora's Mask (which could combo with Ocarina of Time). With that being said, we could also make this versionof Hyrule in our own image, making it our own, only with specific landmarks \n\nI am looking to play a Shiekah myself with the other person potentially playing a Rito or a Zora to play around with the race specific abilities so our characters are diverse and can compliment eachother.\n\nOur characters would be going through the world, accomplishing some goal that the two of us set up for them, be it the plot line of the games or a plot line exclusive to the RP. Above all, I would like our characters to grow together and create a strong romantic relationship with eachother. Our characters with both be 18+ for reasons you can probably guess and we can modify game stories accordingly.\n\nNow here is the good part, which is what I would like to hear from you:\n\n1. What about the above interests you the most?\n\n2. What do you have in mind for your character? [Age, species, personality, etc.)\n\n3. Which world would you prefer taking place in?\n\n4. Whats your characters clothing/ tunic color? (This is to make sure you are reading my list haha)\n\n5. Opinion on Smut and how you would want it incorperated.\n\n6. Ask me a couple questions you would like answered!\n\nGiven these 6 points are answered, i will get back to you as soon as i can! I hope this prompt caught your attention and thanks for reading!\n\nHope to see some orange envalopes!\n\n- Chris",

Animal Crossing is doing a valiant effort at staving off the boredom, but it's just not enough. So, I'm looking for some more roleplaying buddies! Here is a little info on me, and what I'm looking for:\n\n\\-I am a 26yo female, and would like my roleplaying partners to be at least 21+\n\n\\-I am open for NSFW content, but I prefer it to be more abstract, and only ever when the plot calls for it.\n\n\\-I prefer quality over quantity. Normally I try to write a minimum of 3 lines for a reply, and a maximum of 2 paragraphs. The length varies depending on what is happening in the roleplay. Just PLEASE give me something to reply to.\n\n \\-I love OOC chatter! I don't like to give out too much personal information, but I am happy to get to know the people I roleplay with. \n\nNow, for the genres I'm interested in. Like the title says, I'm looking for anything fantasy. Modern, medieval, different world, whatever you like. I have a bunch of different plots, which I can give a link to in a DM. \n\nI will not do slice of life, and there are very few fandoms that I enjoy doing. \n\nIf you;re interested, send me a DM!",

I'm going to keep this short and sweet; over the next few weeks, I'm planning on creating an Elder Scrolls RP (mostly SFW) based in Skyrim some 25 yrs. after the 2011 game of the same name. The backstory is almost finished, and the mechanics are being worked out. I will need a handful of experienced writers and moderators to RP as some of the primary characters and get the community up and running by the end of the month (if not sooner). Thank you for your time, I look forward to hearing from you. Feel free to comment below, or message privately if you'd prefer.",

As most people are, I'm currently trapped in my home for the foreseeable future and looking for something to stay occupied with during all this newfound downtime.\n\nI'm leaning towards sci-fi lately, but I don't have anything specific in mind (that said, someone said something about mechs last week and it's been stuck on my brain ever since). I'm absolutely awful at keeping interest in a fantasy setting, just as a friendly heads up. As far as genres go, I'm not a picky person. And as far as characters go, women are my comfort zone, but I end up writing a load of NPC's and secondary characters anyway, so that doesn't matter a whole lot. Lol\nNote: I don't know shows and games well enough to write a fan-rp. (Sorry!)\n\nFor the most part I don't have many writing requirements, I only ask that you write in 3rd person and be patient if I space out for a day (occasionally I get super busy, but I'll let you know ahead of time)! I have a habit of being chatty in OoC, but you can always tell me to knock it off if that's not your thing.\n\nSo hey! If you had something in mind you wanted to write, that might be sci-fi (and not fantasy), awesome! Shoot me a DM!\n\n(I hope you're alright and staying safe!)",

You don't have to be quick to reply, as long as when you do reply, there's effort behind it!  First and third person are both okay, though I tend to prefer third.\n\nAs for the potential stories...\n\nOriginal settings could be sci-fi, high fantasy, historical fiction (especially cold war/thriller types!), and they could involve any genres you like!\n\nAs for the fandoms I'd love writing... Fire Emblem, Persona 5, My Hero Academia, Legend of Zelda, Star Wars, Fallout, Mass Effect, Dragon Age, and Game of Thrones!  If romance is a part of the story, I'm okay with OCxOC and/or a great many ships that it'd take way too long to list here.  \n\nI'm over 18 and I would like my partner to be, as well.\n\nIf you're interested, send me a chat message!  It's getting late here, but I'll respond as fast as I can and hopefully we can start planning and writing something awesome!",

            "selftext": "Hello! My name is Leif, and I am looking for a new RP partner!\n\nI\u2019m okay with any genre, but all I ask is that we keep it clean and SFW, since I\u2019ve had some bad experiences with smut in the past. I\u2019m also pretty open when it comes to plot, but that does not mean I will do anything. I do not have many plots, so feel free to bring your own or we can work on making one together. I will NOT do fandoms, so please have an OC when you PM me.\n\nRomance is not necessary but is always welcome. As for pairings, I will do FxM or FxF with me playing a female. I don\u2019t care what gender you are in real life, all I ask is that you play F or M. I will do MxM in certain circumstances, as the only male character I have is a fantasy character.\n\nAs far as literacy levels go, all I\u2019m looking for is readability. If you send me a wall of text with no punctuation, I most likely won\u2019t respond. Also please keep your replies to 1-2 short paragraphs, as I easily get overwhelmed with massive amounts of text.\n\nPlease don\u2019t request that I change things about my character. I really should not have to say this, but I\u2019ve recently had a few run-ins with people who requested that I change MAJOR things about my character (Appearance, personality, etc.) I will make VERY MINOR changes depending on the plot/setting of the RP, but other than that, my OCs will stay the same.\n\nI'm also just looking for someone I can talk to OOC and have a normal conversation with.\n\nPlease don't mistake the tone of this whole post for me being mean or unapproachable, I swear I'm nicer than this.  \nI'd also like to give a warning, I am starting online schooling as of next week, and as such I will not be available until about 4 pm PST.\n\nI RP using discord, so message me for my info :)",

            "selftext": "Hi there. I'm always looking for more RP partners so I figured I'd post here! I only write western/prairie sorts of RPs, and have quite a few different ideas which we can discuss further if you're interested.\n\nLet me be brief in what I'm looking for. I want someone dedicated and active, meaning at least a post per day. Stuff happens, and if it does that's totally fine. Just let me know and communicate with me on absences and the like. I'm only looking to write with people 21+, and there are no exceptions, sorry. I am fine writing adult themes but I do not want them to be the focus of the plot. I only write through email and Google Docs. I like slice of life, romance, character interaction, large casts of characters, and some action and drama sprinkled in sparingly to keep things interesting. I'm also very easy going, and I would prefer to work things out instead of simply ghost. Also, please do not ghost me. Just tell me you're done and there will be no hard feelings. It allows me to find a new partner instead of waiting around for you. If I don't hear from you for two days, I'll assume you've moved on. I write a lot and consider myself advanced and I hope you are, too. Please do not contact me unless you're prepared to write novella style. I'm tired of getting my hopes up and then being disappointed when I send my sample. I'll provide a sample and I would like one from you, too. \n\nSend me a PM if you're interested! I'd love to hear from you!",
