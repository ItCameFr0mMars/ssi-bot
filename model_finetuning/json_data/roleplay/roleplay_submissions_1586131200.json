            "selftext": "I've had my fair share of roleplays. Fantasy, sci-fi, mundane, supernatural.\n\nBut the one roleplay I haven't done, one I've been *really* craving recently, is an extremely slow-burning roleplay. And I'm talking it starting with our two characters **hating each other's guts.** I want that friction, that intense fire between them. That battle of power that sometimes results in the two grabbing collars and slamming the other against a wall. (*What may ensue after that is down for discussion. I am open to a sort of 'FWB-but-it's-only-to-exert-the-rage-that's-been-building-up kind of relationship.)*\n\nPerhaps the two are fighting for hierarchy within one of the most powerful gangs. Maybe one works at a coffee shop, and for some reason just ***loathes*** the customer that never fails to come in every morning.\n\nI play any gender, in any pairing, be it FxM, MxM or FxF.\n\nOf course, eventually, I would like for the two to kind of hit that wall; that moment of realisation that they do have feelings for the other. I would prefer to have one realising before the other just to add to that tension. Maybe one confesses and the other flips, telling them to leave either because they can't handle that, or because their own feelings have been scaring them to the point of anger.\n\nI don't want to make this post too long, so if you're interested in an angst-filled, slow-burning roleplay, then shoot me a DM. I'm open to ideas, and in my eyes, the darker the better. I have very few limits.\n\nThank you for reading!\n\n\\~revon x",

I love vampires, post-apocalyptic scenarios, rivalries, hatemances, characters with long and complicated pasts who have to learn to overcome their differences. For romance, I prefer LGBT pairings, so preferably our main characters(if there is romance) would be FxF or MxM but I can also be persuaded into MxF. \n\nI'm always trying my best to improve my writing and love partners that I can learn from. I would love someone similarly inclined who is always working to improve their skills. I usually play male characters as mains but that's more of a habit than a preference. Please message me if you're interested. Discord is my preferred roleplay medium.\n\nEdit: I'm 18+, please be 18+ as well, thank you!",

            "selftext": "First of all, a bit about me. I am an experienced, mature RPer who has a number of years of experience in different formats, including face-to-face, email, forums and the like. Primarily, I am interested in character interaction and development, especially through storytelling, conversation and relationship building. I like to see well developed, well thought out and believable characters. I prefer exotic or unusual settings, primarily science fiction, cyberpunk or post-apocalyptic. \u201cReal world/slice of life\u201d scenarios aren\u2019t that interesting to me; if it's something like a military or espionage setting, maybe, but not something 'mundane'. With that being said, I\u2019m open to ideas if they\u2019re original or creative or a little unusual.\n\nI generally like well-written, well thought out posts, and definitely prefer quality over quantity. I don\u2019t want to read a novel with each post, but I don\u2019t want to see one-line-wonders. Similarly, I am a stickler for grammar and spelling and punctuation, although I am prone to the odd bout of ferocious typos myself. However, as long as the intent is there, then I\u2019m happy.\n\nMy interests lie in mutual storytelling and creativity, rather than playing along to somebody else\u2019s story or the like. I control my character, I decide what\u2019s going on with them, I create their background and so on. I ask for my partners to respect that, as I will do the same for them. Likewise, I will never launch a major story element or a plot twist or the like without okaying it with a partner, as I would expect them to do the same for me. If I do something a partner doesn't want, then I'll gladly change it, but I ask that they will do the same for me.\n\nWhat I am looking for at the moment is a Roleplay set in the **Battletech** (or **Mechwarrior** if you prefer) universe. I am fairly open to ideas and settings, although I also have a few of my own. While this is a Tabletop RPG based universe, I'm looking for free-form writing rather than a system-based game.\n\nIf you are interested, please contact me by **PM**. I will **not** reply to messages posted here or chat requests",

People will get to decide to join the Air Force, Infantry, or be in a tank. This will be realistic so charging a machine gun near will not end well for you.

I will be 26 at midnight. :3 I've tried this before and did not quite get what I was looking for, but I did meet some pretty awesome people, which is a silver lining, more frenzy!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnywho, I am into Sci-Fi along the lines of Star Wars. I like the world of the supernatural and paranormal lore loosely off of Buffy, the Vampire Diaries, Supernatural, etc. I also enjoy fantasy worlds like The Witcher, Game of Thrones, and Skyrim. I'm also a bit of a history buff, I guess? Ancient Rome or Greece, medieval England, Colonial America. I am not opposed to modern or apocalyptic settings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs far as specific tropes, I don't have a go-to; I'm pretty going with the flow. Lol. As a platform medium, I prefer Discord. I can generally put out replies between one or three paragraphs, and when inspiration hits, it can get lengthy. ;) I have no triggers that would hinder me from any specific topic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf interested, please DM me your discord tag or server link. I am open to other suggestions.",

I would like to have an underarching romance plot between the main characters. I usually rp MxM so please lmk if you prefer otherwise beforehand. I would also prefer if you had OCs (original characters), i dont rp with copyrighted characters as i often draw ships if i enjoy them. \n\nI have a link of my characters if your interested, i can send through dms. I generally enjoy fantasy worlds; vampires, mermen, werewolves- as well as horror elements. Anything gritty and dark is also right up my alley. I rp in paragrapgh form, but length may vary on the circumstance. Would prefer a experienced roleplayer// but atleast must be 18+\n\nPlease comment or DM if you're interested and we can discuss more // &lt;3",

One bringing out strange behaviors in people around the city  and some cases in different nations. She is bring down the operation and  those responsible to justice.\n\nYour character is a world famous thief... some how caught in all this mess. Somehow...

So keep that in mind!\n\nLook forward to a few replies!\\~\n\nOh!  And one more thing! In case you look at my search history and find it  empty.

I\u2019m someone who has four years of experience and exclusively roleplay on discord. The fantasy genre is a personal favorite and I\u2019d love to create a story for it. \n\nI enjoy playing a mercenary type character. I\u2019ve got lots of ideas of my own we could possibly play relating to that. Maybe you\u2019re a member of my band of mercs. Maybe you\u2019re a bard who won\u2019t leave me alone. Maybe a princess i\u2019m assigned too. Whatever it may be I\u2019m sure we can create something amazing for it! My private messages are open and I\u2019m looking forward to your requests.",

Thank you for taking the time to read this ad. I am currently looking for someone who wants to explore new worlds, go on daring adventures, and fight against foes in epic battles. Sound like your kind of thing? Then read on adventurer.\n\n*As you stand upon the hill, looking around at the vast wooded landscape at your feet, you are struck with the thought that the world is so much bigger than you ever dared to imagine. Full of forests, mountains, oceans, land worth exploring. Everything out there, just within your grasp and yet so far away. Even as you look upon this beautiful landscape, you can feel it. The darkness that slips from the corners of the world to ruin such things. To take away people\u2019s power and freedom. The world needs a hero, now more than ever. Could that be you?*\n\nI am currently looking to run a dungeons and dragons style one on one campaign. I have done plenty of group campaigns in the past, but currently I\u2019m looking to do something a little smaller scale. So this will be a singular, one on one campaign though you will be able to find NPC companions to help you along the way. We will still be using dice and stats in order to add some unpredictability to our story.\n\n* You must be 18+.\n* A good grasp on grammar and storytelling would be a huge plus.\n* Developing characters and the world is going to be essential, you must want to create a deep and complex character that has to face the world I send your way.\n* I am currently looking for someone who is okay writing a hero type, this doesn\u2019t mean classic goody two shoes by any means, it simply means if you just want to kill things and cause trouble in the world then I\u2019m probably not the DM for you.\n* I would like someone who wants to explore the world I have created, helping me flesh it out in detail as we go from place to place.\n* Lastly, and this is important, you must be willing to do more than use brute force to every problem. I want to see some unique solutions, talking to people and developing relationships, and general good story appearing as we go.\n\nIf all of this catches your attention, and I hope it does, I ask for a few things to get sent my way. If these aren\u2019t included I won\u2019t contact you back. So. Send me a message with what you want to be called, your pronouns you prefer, your age (at least roughly), your experience with writing in general, and what interests you about this. Thank you for taking the time to read all of this, I hope to hear from you soon!",

My name is Leif, and I am looking for a new RP partner!\n\nI\u2019m okay with any genre, but all I ask is that we keep it clean and SFW, since I\u2019ve had some bad experiences with smut in the past. I\u2019m also pretty open when it comes to plot, but that does not mean I will do anything. I do not have many plots, so feel free to bring your own or we can work on making one together. I will NOT do fandoms, so please have an OC when you PM me.\n\nRomance is not necessary but is always welcome. As for pairings, I will do FxM or FxF with me playing a female. I don\u2019t care what gender you are in real life, all I ask is that you play F or M. I will do MxM in certain circumstances, as the only male characters I have are for fantasy plots.\n\nAs far as literacy levels go, all I\u2019m looking for is readability. If you send me a wall of text with no punctuation, I most likely won\u2019t respond. Also please keep your replies to 1-2 short paragraphs, as I easily get overwhelmed with massive amounts of text.\n\nPlease don\u2019t request that I change things about my character. I really should not have to say this, but I\u2019ve recently had a few run-ins with people who requested that I change MAJOR things about my character (Appearance, personality, etc.) I will make VERY MINOR changes depending on the plot/setting of the RP, but other than that, my OCs will stay the same.\n\nI'm also just looking for someone I can talk to OOC and have a normal conversation with.  \nPlease don't mistake the tone of this whole post for me being mean or unapproachable, I swear I'm nicer than this lol.\n\nI RP using discord, so message me for my info :)",

I roleplay exclusively on Discord, and I can play more than one character if the plot calls for it. I can also happily play male characters, but for these plots in particular I'm looking to play the female role. \n\nCatholic Sister/Priest - She's the newest teacher at the Catholic Boarding he presides over. She's more modern than some of the older Sisters who prefer tradition. He knows she needs a friend, a mentor. Somewhere along the lines their friendship turns into more and they both have to grapple with the constant reminder of heir vows.\n\nNanny/Widower - He needs a new nanny, and while she didn't come from the agency or come with any references, she charmed her way into the position. The kids adore her, but her methods are unorthodox, and she seems to cross the lines of professionalism from time-to-time.\n\nFBI Agent/Crime Boss - She's trying to advance her career with the FBI by bringing him down, he likes her pretty blonde hair. Who knows where it will go? Will she fall for him, will he find her out?   \n\n\nThese are all just general ideas, I'm willing to change the premises and set ups. Please send me a message if you're interested! I will only write with people 18+, because I am willing to include NSFW elements if it makes sense in the plot.",

Like the rest of the planet, I\u2019m furloughed, quarantined and bored. Writing these intros is so hard, I feel like you\u2019ve read a hundred of these at this point, and they all sounds the same. I\u2019ll keep it short. \n\nI\u2019m looking for a Marvel roleplayer. The universe and its infinite possibilities provide ample escapism. Additionally, I like a big cast. I always double. When the two sides interconnect over the larger plot, or form deeper relationships beyond who they are paired with, it gives me my jollies.  Any combination of OC and canon is welcome, but for pairings I prefer either mxf or fxf. I want to play my OC but I also want to play canons! What a win!  I\u2019m open to other options, but it will have to really catch my fancy.\n\nThe plot can range from one of those horrible world-ending catastrophes to life in the Tower. \n\nMy favorite comic series is Fracton\u2019s Hawkeye and my favorite movie in the MCU is Iron Man. What is yours? Let me know when you contact me for my discord.",

If you don't want to help come up with one though, there are some in my post history that you can find. In retrospect, they're not that interesting. That's why I prefer to work together more, I feel like if we have equal input things will work better.\n\nWhen it comes to the style of roleplay I like, third person / past tense is my jam. I'm not touchy on detail even though I write a lot, so you can write what's comfortable for you (as long as it still pushes the scene forward). In dialog sections for example, posts can be short / dialog only. I have the same approach to grammar, I don't get offended by bad spelling and sentence structure as long as it isn't ruining the story.\n\nI'm open to any setting, genre, time period, etc. I'm used to medieval fantasy, passionate about horror, and I like to try stuff I've never done before. So don't be afraid to bring me out of my comfort zone.\n\nSome information about myself. I'm 21, busy Saturday nights and a bit on Mondays with random bouts during the week. I'm a slow typer so my responses can take a while to write (15 - 30 min.). I respect privacy and personal space, I don't act like a child if I've been ignored, ghosted, etc. I send one message and if I don't get a response after so long, I move on. My time zone is CST.\n\nThat should be it, I'm looking forward to messages. Thanks.",

I'm 22 and I live in Norway, and I only rp on Discord, and as trans male characters. Which is all ya need to know for now tbh \n\nI have been roleplaying for too long(seriously for 8-ish years total), and I really love doing it! The amount I write tends to vary based on what's going on, and I'll write much longer replies for low-action scenes to put in lots of details, while if there's something big happening I prefer keeping replies short to move things along at a quick pace. I can do either first or third person, and past or present depending on what my partner prefers. I do love having romance in my rps, but prefer for it to not be the main focus the whole time, but rather something that devlops at some time.\n\nI prefer discussing plots to make up something everyone involved will enjoy doing, and developing as the rp moves, but the very loose ideas I have are:\n\nSeen Treasure Planet? Yes? No? Great anyways! So, it's pirates, but in space. Are our characters rival captains who have to start working together to escape/overcome a common enemy/obstacle? A new crewmember and the poor soul who has to teach them to not fall overboard? Something Completely Different?\n\nSo, something related to Red Dead Redemption 2, or, gang of outlaws who have to work together to keep alive &amp; evade the government/police, when, where, &amp; what is very much up for discussion though, as I've got too many ideas.\n\nSomething based VERY loosely on/borrowing universes/ideas from: Inkheart, Sons of Anarchy, Starz' Whitechapel or Spartacus, Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings...

I only roleplay here on Reddit, as it's more convenient for me, and I prefer the direct chat.\n\nNow, for my genres of choice! Right now, I'm really craving a romantic slice-of-life with drama involved. I'm also craving some werewolf roles, but those are secondary right now. I'm willing to do other genres such as medieval, fantasy, and things like that. I've never done sci-fi or historical fiction other than medieval, so I'd be interested in trying those out too. I do not do fandom or celebrity roles, as I don't feel comfortable doing those kinds of roles. If you have any ideas, that's great! I'd be happy to hear your ideas! I also have a couple ideas in mind, but they aren't very concrete at the moment. Or we can brainstorm ideas together. Just get in contact with me, and I'd be happy to discuss ideas!",

War Never Changes.\n\nLike in the Old World, organizations come and go - rising to power and eventually being replaced. The war for the Hoover Dam, and the region of the Mojave has come and gone with a new figure at the head.\n\nCourier Six.\n\nThe Courier, who had cheated death once before - had again cheated fate. Taking over New Vegas, and the surrounding communities. With his limitless army of upgraded Sentry Bots, and multiple factions that supported him, he protects New Vegas from further annexation by the NCR and future conquest by the now leaderless Legion.\n\nWith general communities thriving under increased trade protection and the power of the Hoover Dam, the Mojave seemed at it's most prosperous in years. However, there would be some that would see The Courier be removed from power. Operating from the shadows, many isolated groups had come out to oppose his rule, forming terrorist and political groups attempting to supersede him.\n\nYou are new to the Mojave. With little more than the clothes on your back, you've come to New Vegas in search of your own fortune. Whether it be fate or not, it seemed your own path lied beside the one who had walked many...\n\nHello, hope you didn't mind that little intro for this Fallout: New Vegas RP! With this prompt, I'm looking for long term partners who would be up to the task of working on this project of mine.\n\nAnyone is welcome to join, although same sex pairings with The Courier won't be used here. It will be story based, so any lewd/more intimate moments will be built up to over a stretch of time.\n\nIf this interests you, great! feel free to send me your own character bio and any questions you may have in any DM's. The best way to reach me is through my Discord or my Kik, and through PMs on here. Hope to hear from you soon!",

I'm also losing my job in two weeks so then I will have nothing but time so I might as well use it to get back into roleplaying. \n\n\nFor a long time, I've wanted to do a story that takes place in a mental hospital. I want to create multiple characters, who are there for different reasons and suffer from different psychological problems yet somehow find themselves connecting to each other. Maybe it's because inside these walls, they get to not pretend to be normal for once? \n\nI want to make the story and the characters as realistic as possible which means that I don't want to over romanticize these issues nor do I want it to get overly grim and dark despite of the nature of the story. I want to see dark humor and finding the joy in small things. Finding the will to get better. \n\nI do have some ideas in mind when it comes to characters but I'd rather discuss those in private. I use Discord or Skype mainly but can be persuaded into trying other platforms as well. My length varies a lot depending on the scene and my partner but I usually don't write very lengthy responses (800+ words)\n\nWhen it comes to romance, I enjoy mxm the most but I can add fxm and fxf too since we'd have multiple characters. Not everyone has to be gay. \n\nI won't roleplay with anyone under the age of 21. I also won't roleplay with anyone who is stuck in only one role when it comes to romance.

I'm here today to offer up another plot for your consideration! \n\nGetting the basics out of the way: English is my second language, I'm 37, F, and am work one week on/one week off until the end of the current situation. I'll be off next week, so it's a good time to try and find a partner for this.\n\nThe plot: I'm looking to write a servant who becomes a good friend and then a lover for the heir of the family she works for. I'm thinking either he's permanently in isolation for some reason, or temporarily for some illness and she's tasked with taking care of him, and a bond develops slowly. This will be a clean/fade to black story. \n\nInterested? Drop me a PM and let's talk! Please note that I don't roleplay through Discord or Reddit Chat (I don't even use the chat).

The genres I am interested in at the moment are somewhat limited, however, I am not strict on how I am looking to approach them. Some things before we get down to exactly what I am looking for. I will write with males, but will not do mxm romantic pairings. I have no limits, but context is entirely important, and I do avoid the heaviest subjects if at all possible. I will absolutely double and I ask that my partner do the same.   \n\n\nThe most important thing here is that I need someone who is **moderately active.** That means I am looking for someone who can manage at least one reply a day on average. Of course, I am realistic, but I have had enough of people promising replies and not delivering, taking 3+ days to reply without explanation or just flat out blowing me off. When I am writing, I will give 110% and I expect the same. What are we here for, if not to write an excellent story together?   \n\n\nNow for the plots I am interested in. I will put in bold the concepts I am most excited by.   \n**Star Wars**  \nOriginal Sci-Fi  \n**Superhero**  \nWestern/Horror  \nPost Apocalyptic  \nMedieval Fantasy  \nSuspense/Horror  \n\n\nIf you're interested in any of those plots, I hope to hear from you!

            "selftext": "\nHey, M here looking to fill the obscene amount of time I have now that I am quarantined, so hoping for a fairly regular replier but this isn't a must. I'm 21+ and looking for 18+ partners to write with. I'm a big fan of writing angst and spinning out replies that tick both the quality and quantity boxes. So I'm hoping to find someone who doesn't shy away from the heavier scenes. That said, I always listen to triggers \u2014 just tell me them in your opening email! As well as enjoying angst, I'm also open to smut, fluff, comedic scenes... everything really. I write M/M and F/F but I am happy to include F/M as a side ship. Which brings me to another thing. I don't double, but I love writing side characters and giving them the love and attention they deserve. So I'm hoping to find someone who feels the same and is happy to write scenes that aren't just focused around our mains.\n\n\n\nWhich brings me to what I am looking for!\n\n\n\nPrimarily I am after a roleplay concerning La Casa de Papel (Money Heist) and particularly Berlin/Palermo. I wouldn't mind playing either but I am currently leaning towards Palermo (Martin). My ideas for this aren't too put together at the moment, but I would really like to do a rp around Season 1 where Palermo is part of the Mint Heist. All that beautiful tension \u2014 especially after the scenes we saw in S4. I would also be interested in writing something where Berlin returns after robbing the Mint as he makes it out (and his illness isn't as quick to take him over) around the time that Rio is taken to tell Palermo that they need to steal the gold. Once again, all about that gorgeous tension in a high stakes game. \n\n\n\nI'd also be down for writing some Helsinki/Palermo as a side ship for extra tension and writing Tatiana for Berlin too, so as not to just completely forget everything there. She was cool. Also happy to write any original women too. Let's get talking! \n\n\nFurthermore, Nairobi and Tokyo is another ship I would be interested in writing but I don't think it has the depth for a long term roleplay like P/B but if you came to me with a lot of ideas then I would be down. \n\n\nSo yeah, basically that's it. Obviously I'd like someone who has seen all the seasons and understands and cares for the characters and their complexities (and their toxicity) the same as me. I'm an OOC chatter fan, so I would adore finding someone who is down to rant and rave over the latest season. Please get in touch!!!\n\n\nPlease message me here and I\u2019ll tell you my email (preferred) or discord! Then please get in contact there and tell me a bit about yourself/what you're interested in/any ideas you have flowing etc. If you write a proper introduction instead of just a couple sentences I'll adore you... but I promise I'm not a hard taskmaster \u2014 just a believer that if we are here to write, first impressions are great! Hope to hear from someone soon! Stay safe everyone!",

I think the biggest thing for me here is that the two were once connected, and have recently come into contact again.\n\n\n**[ 1 ]:** Two con artists reunite for their biggest heist yet after years spent apart. In this scenario, the conman was the more experienced of the two, taking the other in as an apprentice. Years later, through a mutual contact, we\u2019re reunited for what seems like the biggest break of our careers. You hadn\u2019t expected me to grow as skilled as I did. (based on the movie Focus)\n\n\n**[2]:** I thought that the last time I\u2019d seen you, that you would be gone for good. This is more mafia-centered. Basically, we were two kids that got into this life of crime together. We grew up there, and you became the mafia\u2019s greatest weapon as their leader. One day, you let me know that you would be leaving. I didn\u2019t follow behind like you had wanted. Years later, and the city\u2019s detective force, bent on eliminating organized crime, has their own greatest weapon: **you**.\n\n**[3]**: You\u2019re a police officer in a small town, working on a case that\u2019s rapidly spreading around town. This is the most action you\u2019ve seen in work in years, and you could use the break. The next thing you know, I\u2019m back in town after leaving years before, but not to reunite. I\u2019m here to take over *your* case.\n\n**[4]:** You\u2019re a detective, working undercover to bust a ring of dealers. Naturally, going undercover gives you that bout of anxiety, but it\u2019s nothing you can\u2019t handle. You know that you\u2019ve always tried to be careful. And it\u2019s worked. Until you come upon your mission, and you find yourself falling for the daughter of the lead dealer.  \n\n**I\u2019m looking for someone who can write 3rd person, 18+ willing to write over Discord. Send me a PM if interested!**",

I\u2019m looking for a partner who would be interested in a long term rp of a love story in modern times between a prince falling in love with a common guy. My inspiration came from having recently finished Red White and Royal Blue which had a similar vibe. I don\u2019t have a ton of rules about the rp but my preferences are that it\u2019s written in 3rd person, it\u2019s done on discord and preferably (at least in the beginning stages) is more focused on developing the romance between the characters.\n\nMy idea for the plot would be something along the lines of a prince who is tired of living his royal life so he does little escapes from the palace disguising himself as a \u201cnormal guy\u201d. One of those days he meets a guy and they click pretty well, being pretty friendly and somehow flirty to each other, even exchanging phone numbers. That is until someone recognizes the prince and ruins his disguise. However the guy doesn\u2019t start throwing himself at the prince as he would expect from most people, which intrigued him right away.\n\nThank you for reading through all of this, the plot idea is still a bit rough so I\u2019d definitely welcome any suggestions or ideas that you might have. If you are interested then please PM so we can discuss it and exchange discord usernames.",

Thanks for taking a look at my advertisement!\n\nMy name's Kyle, I'm 20, English and I'm currently looking for some RP partners to write some cool and original stories! Before I say about what I like to roleplay, allow me to introduce myself and my likes.\n\n\u2022 I'm currently 20, so I'm looking for someone 18+. This is mainly due to the fact that my RPs can NSFW in parts and I just wanna make sure no trouble comes of it.\n\n\u2022 I'm currently only looking for FEMALE RP Partners. I do apologize if this offends anyone of the male/trans community. Its just my personal preference. I'd also ask that you're fairly active too. A couple of posts a day at least.\n\n\u2022 I like a partner who's detailed and experienced. Fine, quickfire posts can be shorter, but I like quality in my posts. I'm not asking for half a novel though. There's such a thing as too little and too much detail. Also, I RP in THIRD person only. Again, just my preference, however, I am more than welcome for you to use third/first at your own desire. I also play OC Characters only as well. I don't find it entertaining to play a Canon Character. I don't mind them appearing as side characters but the main story players will be OC x OC.\n\n\u2022 Finally, I like people who are interested in the same things as myself. Please understand what my RP is being based on. I offer a variety so there's plenty to choose from.\n\nRight! Now I have my expectations out of the way, here are the things I'm looking for RP story wise!\n\n* Halo : Halo has always been a number one fandom that I have loved to Rp in the past but have never really found someone perfect for the role. So for this RP, I can do alot of different themes/pairings so long as, said later, that the characters are indeed OC.\n* Destiny : Exactly the same as Halo, I absolutely love this game. To the point where I am a Lore Nerd as well as a Sherpa. I would love to find someone who would want to delve into the stories behind the game and the hundreds of years of lore prior to the first game beginning.\n\nI hope you all enjoyed what I've produced and I hope that I get some responses fairly soon! Thanks again for taking the time to read my post! See you soon!",

The deaths were many,  as the occupants of Mythostraad did their best to push back the occult forces. In this battle, the current ruler of the land, Alatrath was slain by his apprentice, Nonverum. After they came out victorious and the occult forces were defeated, Nonverum took control of the land, leading it to Prosperity and Fortune.

            "selftext": "Aristotle said that the plot of the story is central, while the characters are on the peripheries. The characters are the means to which the end is achieved; they are agents, nodes, drivers of the plot, but the plot is greater than them. To me, characters are like foils - they are what highlight the themes of the story, they are agents of something bigger than them. The story is the overarching structure and the characters are secondary. Story-driven over character-driven is how I write. For this reason, I will be playing both male/female characters.  \n\nCommunication is key, and I reply reasonably often unless something were to come up. I write multi-paragraph responses. I don't expect you to write an essay, but I prefer responses that show effort. Please be literate and 18+. If you feel like you're not interested in the story anymore, please let me know rather than not saying anything and leaving us both in limbo. Let's not waste our time and make the most out of it. \n\nThe kind of story I'd like to create with you is not your ordinary story. It is an *extraordinary* story. It is a philosophical, psychological, spiritual, thrilling story. A story packed with adventure, with glass-breaking action, and murderous mystery. A story that descends into the heart of darkness, a story of death and destruction dealing with the profoundest questions of life.\n\nHere are the plots and characters to choose from:\n\n**Killing Your Love**\n\n&gt; After a tragic mission where she had to kill the love of her life, the FBI's top agent has a new mission. She must kill the presidential candidate before the election. Specifically, on his wedding day, in front of the world. But there's two big problems. The first is that she's his bride. The second is that her ex-lover somehow survived her assassination, and is trying to kill her. There's also an esoteric cult running amuck, whose hedonistic wealthy members frequent a notorious nightclub based off of Dante's Inferno. The CIA want her to kill the presidential candidate, kill her ex-lover (again), and investigate the libertine cult. In her search for answers, she finds herself traveling into a web of deadly secrets. The Truth isn't for everyone. But it'll find her in the end, at the lowest circle of the Inferno.  \n\n&gt; Themes and topics: romance, thriller, mystery, psychology, drama, suspense, action, mind control, spy, religion, politics, conspiracy theories, crime, tragedy\n\n&gt; Characters: You will play our star FBI agent. I will play everyone else.\n\n**The Trillionaire's Top Table** \n\n&gt; The most exclusive club in the world offers the most exclusive pleasure in the world. But membership comes at a price: death. Truly, this is where the highest stakes and the highest pleasures are had. Two Hollywood celebrities want to risk it all to taste that divine ecstasy. They hire a manager to help them out. Their manager is overjoyed because she's a socialite entertainment consultant who thinks she's landed her dream job. Additionally, one of the celebrities happens to be her childhood crush. But when she and her famous clients clash with the club's wealthiest, wisest, and most diabolical members, it becomes her worst nightmare.\n\n&gt; Themes and topics: celebrity, fame, hollywood, suicide, romance, mystery\n\n&gt; Characters: You will play the ambitious smitten manager. I will play everyone else. \n\n**The Plot to Kill God**\n\n&gt; A sickly artist finds herself embroiled in a quest to save the world from ending during an apocalypse. She finds who she really is as she journeys across England confronting the Illuminati and the Catholic Church. The two organizations are involved in a conspiracy to reclaim the Holy Grail, the Ark of the Covenant, and the Spear of Destiny.  This super conspiracy dates back all the way back to Adam and Eve. The artist discovers the bloodlines of the plot linked to the Bible, the Cathars, Knight Templars, Freemasons, Nazis. In discovering all this, the artist finds herself in a plot to bring about the world's final outcome: to bring about the second coming of God. The Illuminati wants to kill God. The Catholic Church wants to save God. She must decide which one to listen to. To decide is to divide. When the fate of the world rests on your hands, the stakes couldn't be higher.\n\n&gt; Themes and topics: conspiracy, history, mystery, thriller, action, adventure, romance, military, religion, politics, apocalypse \n\n&gt; Characters: You will play the destined artist. I will play everyone else. \n\n**Putting People Over Profit**\n\n&gt; Everyone knows the price of everything and the value of nothing. Everyone worships the super rich and the celebrities. Everyone wants to partake in the bling dream of being rich and famous. Money is everything and money is all. Social worth is tied to monetary value. A failed actor is laughed at by society. They've been laughing at her since she was born. The bankers are laughing their way to the bank while she lives with her friends paycheck to paycheck, from gig to gig, in a neverending boat of uncertainty and inconsistency. She wants to make it big someday and become a star like all those on TV. One day, a mysterious organization emerges from the shadows to wage war against the super rich. They call themselves The Nobodies and rally public support in order to end economic inequality. The actor joins the organization after a PR stunt and finds herself as one of their agents of the revolution. Soon, the super rich are ignored and shunned, ridiculed and held in contempt, as their financial value becomes worthless and the ordinary masses have finally turned against them. But when the actor starts questioning who's behind The Nobodies, she finds out the most diabolical plot in history: a plot to let one rich person rule the world. Only one person can stop it, and she's about to meet him and change her life forever.\n\n&gt; Themes and topics: celebrity, hollywood, revolution, politics, thriller, mystery, meritocracy, revolution, new world order, atlas shrugged\n\n&gt; Characters: You will play the unwitting world-historic actor. I will play everyone else. \n\n**The Magical Murder Mystery**\n\n&gt; A miraculous island had emerged from the sea without rhyme or reason. The island was so strange that all the world's governments had announced a unilateral quarantine so that scientists could study this vast island, free of tourist interference. No one was allowed in, and the navy had set up a blockade to keep any sightseers away. The mysterious island spawned more conspiracy theories than anything in the history of civilization. The island was named Lyonesse, after the famous kingdom of King Arthur which was said to have sunk exactly in the same place where this mysterious island appeared. Whatever the truth was, one fact remained certain: it was a home for a mysterious killer who became known as the Mistletoe Madman. It was claimed that the same sacred plant, the mistletoe, was being used by this killer who slayed the government's researchers. With each grotesque murder, a mistletoe sprig was left behind, as a macabre marking of the killer's monstrous modus operandi. The maniac was said to be hiding on the island, harnessing its magical powers to destroy the world. And it's up to a top intel agent and her two pals to led a search and rescue team to stop him.\n\n&gt; Themes and topics: tragedy, mystery, thriller, action, adventure, apocalypse, psychology, philosophy, politics, fantasy, supernatural \n\n&gt; Characters: You will play the top agent. I will play everyone else.\n\nIt's time to begin the show. To raise the curtains and make a performance worth seeing. The spotlight's on you. Are you ready to shine?",

I\u2019m not quite sure of an exact plot, but I\u2019d love to set something in a small American city with either a contemporary timeline or maybe set in the 1980s or 1990s. Most of my RP experience has been with procedural plays, but I\u2019d love start something that\u2019s a very character driven platonic role play, but maybe still has some legal or crime content in it. My comfort level is keeping things at a PG-13 level, and please only 18+ replies.\n\nAs a role player I like to keep my replies concise, and always try to leave actionable responses. I\u2019ve mostly played on SL, but have a bunch of text experience. IRL I\u2019m an American woman in my 30s, and would love to find someone with a similar background.",

It is an old land, a land of much contention, and now, it is fractured.*\n\n*To the north, a widow desperately seeks to keep her kingdom from collapse. Amidst a rather ruinous scandal, sedition, famine, and the end of plague, she cements her power, centralizing and concentrating the rule of the state under her dominion. Armies raise, loyal not to their lord, but their queen. Her dynasty will not be forgotten.*\n\n*To the south, a young bastard, seeking to end the oppression of the people he grew up with, rises to claim what he demands is his birthright. With the backing of an embittered queen, he set forth, conquering and claiming the land, finding many a supporters, those that find the old system too weak. His destiny lies with the throne. And who can stop destiny?*\n\n*Now is a time of darkness. When brothers turn blades against another. When each side spends the land to fight what the other had used. When many mothers outlive their sons, many wives made widows. Scaranza is truly sundered.*\n.....\n\nTales of the Sundered takes place on but one landmass in a larger world. More than just a civil war, it's about the many stories the people there have to offer. Tales of love, hate, loss, greed, and peace. You can be damm near anything, but before you join, there are a couple of low fantasy rules:\n\n*1.* **No fantasy races.** No elves, dwarves, orcs, or anything of such. Humans only.\n\n*2.* **No magic.** No fireballs or wizardry. \"Magic\" in this setting is nothing more than an understanding of chemistry, alchemy, mixed in with astrology and a couple other things. Now, there are *some* supernatural elements, namely in the form of patronage to deities, whether good or evil. That is a pathway to somethings considered... unnatural...\n\nHopefully, some down-to-earth nitty gritty fantasy is your schtick, and I've piqued your interest.\nIf you are interested in joining, pm me for a link to the Discord server.\n\n\"It\u2019s a rebellion on an island, with a wider world to discover. For fans of chivalry and mordhau, who wished for more of a story where before there was none, this is your rp. Be a noble, a commoner, the chivalrous knight, the fearsome bandit king, the most coveted strumpet or the famed bard from three kingdoms over. In a land so sundered, only your legend, your story, will make it whole.\"\n-Willfulmetal. Senior member",

            "selftext": "The heavy antique door clattered behind you, and the sweet musty scent of mouldering furniture seeped through your nostrils. It was uncomfortably welcoming. It felt like a stray childhood memory had somehow floated up to the surface and made everything seem familiar and hospitable. As a matter of fact, it smelled just like grandpa's attic room, where you used to read Robinson Crusoe and watch Super 8 films on his projector.\n\nExcept for the very minor detail which was, you know, that never happened. There was no such memory in your childhood. And if there had been, it certainly did not feature The Banshee.\n\n\"Why hello again, my dear.\"\n\nOddly, you always seemed to forget about The Banshee until you'd crossed over the threshold. But she was just as permeating a presence as the smell of yellowed Robinson Crusoe pages from gramps's attic room. And no matter which direction you faced, her parched, toothless smile perpetually lingered in your peripheral vision.\n\nIn any other circumstances, the creep factor would send you reeling for the door and sprinting as far away from this pawn shop as your legs could hold you. But these weren't ordinary circumstances. Creep factor was exactly what you were after right now.\n\n\"Hello, Ms.,\" you murmured stiffly, barely resisting the temptation to call her 'Banshee'. Her name wasn't on the sign, but you could feel it in your bones. She was _definitely_ The Banshee. For all you knew, it might as well _have been_ her name. \"I'm looking for, uh...\" You began, but the words were surprisingly difficult to fish out.\n\n_What_ were you looking for, exactly? You were pretty sure it was something specific. Something very very important. Something that absolutely needed the creep factor. Something you could only find right here.\n\nThe Banshee said nothing. Her disturbing smile remained unchanged. It was impossibly distracting.\n\nYou capitulated. \"I guess I'll look around.\" You knew you didn't really have to. The objects here had a tendency to find themselves owners, not the other way around. The hag probably knew exactly what you'd find the moment you walked in. That was just the way these things played out. You had a theory that the Banshee herself was simply an Object \u2013 not an actual person and no different than any of the other hoodoo mojo lying about. Maybe the shop was alive and she was just an apparition to give it a human face. Human~ish anyway. Real humans tended to blink once in a while.\n\nIt was of course a ludicrous idea. But then again, so was the Mask of whomstever you acquired from here months ago. A mask that actually made you invisible. Like literally invisible. In fact, it made you so invisible that no one seemed to even remember you ever existed. So invisible that your face vanished from photographs, your name from official records, your apartment door from the building... et cetera. You had become a non-person. Funnily enough, your nonpersonhood persisted after you took the mask off. That was just the way hoodoo magic worked, you supposed.\n\nThe Banshee of course still remembered you. Because of course she would. That was when you got the Mirror of... well, the Mirror, and assumed a new identity. Little did you know at the time that all your new persona's newfound wealth was borrowed Mafia money. Those guys? Not exactly subtle about collecting debts. There was a moral about greed right there if you cared to learn it, but that was the problem with real life morals, they always came post factum. Now you definitely could've used the Mask of whomstever right about then, but strangest thing about it, it just didn't seem to work on Mirror characters. And before you knew it, you were back at the Banshee's.\n\nThere was a Wardrobe there that could take you into the past. You were smart enough to know by then it was not going to be that simple, but, something about drowning men and grasping for alligator tails. You stepped in, and came out, to a time before the Mask and before the Mirror. Yes, it wasn't _exactly_ the same as your real past. Some things had changed. Trump had won, Britain had Brexited, there was some sort of plague roaming about, but you just had to learn to live with it.\n\nThe Banshee was the same though. And so was the shop. Whatever little universe existed there, it was unaffected by any of the hoodoo magic. And although you wanted to think you'd learned your lesson, there were simply problems in this world that needed a little bit of paranatural _oomph_ to solve. Urgently.\n\n\"What is this?\" Your gaze had stopped on an elaborate cherry wood egg timer. The label read \"Hourglass of the Lucky Hour\". Lucky hour? Yes, that sounded about right. You knew you'd find what you were looking for. Or well, what you were looking for would find you, that's usually how those things worked out. But you struggled to imagine what could go so wrong with a little bit of extra luck. Sure, it was going to be very hoodoo luck, but hoodoo or not, luck was luck. There were literally no possible downsides to luck. Go ahead and ask Gladstone Gander.\n\nYour mind was already made up by the time your hand automatically reached for the Hourglass. \"I'll take it,\" you added in what was a bizarre use of the future tense.\n\nAnd then the strangest thing happened. For a split second, you could swear the Banshee's creepy smile flashed into an indiscernible grimace \u2013 surprise, worry, anger, you couldn't tell. Whatever it was, it gave you extremely bad spidey sense tingles. The next moment they were gone. You exhaled.\n\n\"Well, you already took it, so either way, it's yours.\" The Banshee nodded. \"Now please leave.\"\n\nThe Banshee never sold her stuff for money. You supposed she extracted her payment through the Objects somehow. Hoodoo worked in mysterious ways and you could only theorise, but that seemed to be the general business model. However, you don't remember her having ever asked you to leave like that. That was some _bad_ juju. You weren't one to argue with a voodoo witch though.\n\nYou left in silence as the door clattered behind you. Then it locked, and the sign flipped around to 'Closed'. But the further you walked away from that place, the less you cared. Things were just going to be fine somehow. You knew it. You had the Hourglass. You already felt like one lucky son of a gun. And it was time to find out just how lucky that was.\n\n---\n\nHey guys, it's me Amy again, with another of my favourite themes, cursed objects! How cursed? I guess we'll find out, won't we? Without spoiling too much all at once, all I'm going to say is my character is somehow tied to the Hourglass and she's not the Banshee (you can breathe a sigh of relief now).\n\nI've intentionally left a lot of blanks that you can fill yourself so you can make your character yours. What does he need the hoodoo luck for? What is he going to do with it? Totally up to you.\n\nAs always my rules are the same, we can control any number of NPCs we want and we can do whatever we want to them, as long as we leave our own characters' fates up to us. I also tend to take on a bit of a GM role during these stories, I guess it's just the way my partners and I like it, but if you don't like it, please let me know up front.\n\nI use third person and past tense, reddit PM only.",

            "selftext": "Hi there! I'm 18 years old and currently searching for other girls to be roleplay with! I don't have many requirements other than that you be female, are literate, and are capable of a decent amount of detail. I, myself, have been roleplaying since I was fairly young, eight or so years, so I am comfortable adapting to the majority of people's styles/preferences. \n\nI have an idea in mind, that I will go more in depth with if you choose to DM me. That idea will be a mixture of fantasy, drama, romance, and a tinge of slice of life. If that peaks your instrest, please shoot me a DM! It would be helpful if you had a decent amount of knowledge of anime tropes and such as well as it follows a similar style.\n\nThanks for reading!",

Staying home all day gets boring, but I\u2019m looking to alleviate this dull feeling for myself (and one other individual) through the art of roleplay!\n\nThis will be in a fantasy setting: I\u2019m thinking a mystical one where the entire land is covered in woodland, occupied by humans, elves, gnomes, and all sorts of races. The theme will be moderately lighthearted, but there may be mature aspects (violence, etc.), and it\u2019ll be somewhat inspired by European (specifically Norse) mythology.\n\nI have an idea for this plot, however it\u2019s not fully cemented in my head as of yet, and I can\u2019t think of a presentable way to write it down, so I\u2019ll wait until someone messages me to explain it.\n\nWhichever way we go, the roleplay will be an adventure-romance between; my character, a nomadic warrior cursed with ursine traits; and your character, a witch. \n\nI\u2019d quite like the romance to be slow-burn, perhaps the couple even dislike each other at first but are somehow indebted to each other, forcing them to travel together. Concerning mature content, I\u2019d like it to be excluded - or included later on - but this can be further discussed in the PMs.\n\nMy timezone is BST (Britain) so if you abide by a European timezone, that\u2019d be a bonus. A decent amount of free time is appreciated. The post frequency will depend on an agreed post length, but the ideal frequency is daily.\n\nI operate on Discord. If you could first send an introductory message through Reddit PMs it\u2019d be much appreciated. \n\nSee you soon!",

            "selftext": "[GROUP] [DISCORD] The Midnight Cabin Massacre!\n\nHey there, name\u2019s Tier. Recently, I\u2019ve been in the mood for something a bit \u201cslasher-y\u201d, and had an interesting idea for a small roleplay group. Looking for maybe 10 or so people, as well as someone who is good at server creation (I mostly use mobile, so my tools are limited). \n\nOne group of people would play the \u201chunters\u201d, a group of demented psychos who have an insatiable blood lust. This group of hunters would have to match, at least thematically. That\u2019s for the people that want to be the hunters to decide. \n\nThe other group of people would play the \u201csurvivors\u201d, a group of teens who just came to party in the woods, when before they knew it, people were being slain left and right, being slashed, stabbed, and murdered. Now, the small group left alive must fend off the band of blood thirsty killers, looking for a way to survive the night. \n\nA perk and skill system will be implemented as well, to add a bit more strategy and fun to it!\n\nI\u2019d expect at least two paragraphs per response, and for people to be near EST ( a few hours difference doesn\u2019t matter much). \n\n DM me if interested!",

I\u2019m looking for something simple (aka slice of life) but I can totally work with fantasy or anything like that. I role play on discord, and I prefer to role play there, so I apologize if that leads you away from this post. I\u2019m open to SFW or NSFW, and those details can be discussed if ya message me. If you have any ideas, feel free to let me know. Just PM me and we\u2019ll get talking. Hopefully you\u2019re just as much a hopeless romantic as I am. Have a good day and stay safe!",

We start out as friends but over the course of the trip become closer, resulting in a relationship by the end of the trip. \n\n2. Live in the same town and cross paths one day while waiting for a train. We make conversation on the ride and this is what sparks the interest between one another. \n\n3. It\u2019s a school reunion, we start talking again. We had feelings for each other but never said anything about it at the time. The feelings come out when talking at the reunion and we try to date. \n\nIf any of these sound interesting send a pm. More looking for this rp to be clean, open to hearing any ideas you might have as well. Would have to do rp though Reddit though.",

I'm just looking for a group of like minded people that I can create a world and tell a clever story with. Preferably over Discord as that's what I'm used to but I'm cool with branching out into other things. I normally type at least a paragraph (4-5 sentences), but I can easily draw it out depending on the situation or if there is a lot of action. Each paragraph contains imagery, characterization, figurative language, etc. My interests and inspirations are all over the place. Stuff like the Kill Six Billion Demon Comics, Over the Garden Wall, Darksouls, Eldritch/Lovecraft Horror, Kenshi, Bioshock, etc. I'm down for anything as long as it isn't just our characters running around doing mundane things. Maybe we could come up with a good NPC antagonist? I dunno, school is out and I have never been alone with my own thoughts for this long, please HMU.",

            "selftext": "Hey, I\u2019m looking for a long-term partner for a fantasy based roleplay. What I mean by Fire Emblem/Berserk is something sort of similar to those things, not exactly. I\u2019ve been playing Fire Emblem recently and haven\u2019t gotten too far yet but I sincerely love the story in three houses. The way you\u2019re a mercenary and lead noble soldiers to battle. Recruiting different kinds of people. All that good stuff.\n\nI want to play a mercenary character who falls into a similar situation as Byleth. A mercenary with no manners and only fights to survive. Young nobles that lead houses somehow encounter him, and he chooses your house. You would be playing the noble. I want there to be plenty of side characters to play and expand the story so we get the best of everything. This roleplay won\u2019t be for the light-hearted either. Dark tones will be included. Showing the sheltered nobles that there are worse things beyond war and outside their castle walls. Choosing the better of two terrible choices, the thought processes of others, etc.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested DM me. This rp will be through discord. We can talk about it there after you hit me up.\n\nHope to get plenty of replies.",

            "selftext": "Blood, death, romance, drama, guns, multiple races, magic. This story has them all. \n\nA city that is filled with all kinds of races, be it Elves, demons, vampires blah blah Anything! The world has always been like this, now with all these races comes discrimination against mixed breeds, at one point in time there was a mass genocide against these people. A few exist, forever in hiding. To this day, Humans are still the largest race compared to the others, some hide in forests while others dwindle off over time.\n\nBut this story takes place in a large city called Los Gatos. Now Los Gatos has quite a large crime rate, going from petty theft to large Mafia's. That's where the LGSPD comes in, Los Gatos Special Police Department. They are a different branch of Policemen/Women compared to the original LGPD. This special branch deals with magic cases. 10% of the globe can harness magical abilities, no one knows why or how but they just can. Most tend to lead a life of crime with no one able to withstand their powers. That's where the Special division steps in, made of people who wield magic for the greater good.\n\nNow, I'm looking for someone to create a team with me, there will be six members in total, you'll play three and I will do the same. As well as any extras. I'd love for this to be a large expansive city, with lots to explore.\n\nThe two mandatory roles are that you'll be playing a young Female Detective who is the Captain of this team. That role is a must, the other two could be whatever.\n\nThe real story begins here as you ( Captain ) receive a phone call late into the night as you've been called in for an emergency interrogation. A boy had been found in a warehouse by the docks covered in blood with six dead bodies around him yet there's no evidence saying he did anything. Where will this case bring you?\n\nHi there! I've been excited to get this out so here's a few extra things.\n\n\u00b0 I am 18+ and I'd expect the same due to the fact that I'll be talking about mature and dark themes.\n\n\u00b0 I am a descriptive writer so the least you get out of me will be a Paragraph the most could be way past the discord limit. I'd expect almost the same, a well written paragraph or two is good enough!\n\n\u00b0 Please don't be shy in OOC! I'd love to talk about the RP and about anything else really.\n\n\u00b0 I may have come up with the idea but what I really want is someone to help me Build a story. I've created the groundwork now help me create something beautiful!\n\n\u00b0 3rd person Only!\n\n\u00b0 I only use Discord! \n\nI'm sorry if you've messaged me before and I didn't see it, I got like 9 or so messages for this and chose only a couple but they didn't work out ;-;. \n\nOne last thing. Please in you're message tell me why you'd be my roleplay partner? What could you bring to the table to make this the most extravagant roleplay ever! I'm looking forward to those messages.",

            "selftext": "Hello, you can call me Doe! I'm in my 20s, a student, and a proud cat mom. I write multiple paragraphs/novella style (200-500+ words). I love to write detailed descriptions and delve into a character\u2019s head/emotions as well as surroundings. I compare it to writing a novel together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand if the scene doesn\u2019t have alot going on and therefore requires less like rapid fire. I adore having long, thoughtful replies where we truly immerse ourselves in the world. I'm hoping to find a partner whose as enthusiastic and passionate about the plot and writing as I am. When I get invested in a story, it\u2019s 100% dedication. Getting a reply is the highlight of my day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a big fan of romance and using face claims. I\u2019m the type to make pinterest boards, spam you with gifs, headcanons, and send you songs that remind me of our characters and/or ship. I'll get excited if we come up with a great plot idea or if our characters are being cute or going to get into trouble. I live for this kind of stuff honestly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast but not least I only do MxF (with myself in the female role and looking for older male characters). I don\u2019t double, but I\u2019m more than happy to write side characters of either gender to help move the story along. I'd highly prefer female authors writing male characters. **Male authors, please stop contacting me.** I've been burned too many times. If you persist, I'll ignore your message. Sorry!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDesperately Searching For\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- 21+ partners\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- For you to have an excellent grasp of grammar, punctuation, spelling, and capitalization. Both in character and out of character. (Literate to advanced writers only, please. I'm not looking for newbies).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- The more description, the better! I'm looking for someone can write as much as me (2 to 4 paragraphs or more) and really bring the story to life. I lose interest if I'm the only one that's invested/enthusiastic or coming up with plot ideas. Quality writing makes my heart happy, as does world building together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- The use of real life face claims and joining me in the wonderful world of ship/character development isn't a requirement but I'd sure be delighted if we were on the same page in this regard. (I won't use anime faces, only realistic art if you're uncomfortable with real life)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Someone who won't leave without warning or explanation after sending the first post. I'm looking for the long term here, and I have been greatly saddened by how many partners have left me high and dry recently.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you've made it this far, thank you! You won't be disappointed in writing with me. I tend to be online daily and while I'd like it if you were too, I understand that real life things come first. Please let me know if you're going to be inactive, long days/weeks of silence make me nervous.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOriginal Genres:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Mafia/Crime\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Post Apocalyptic/Dystopia\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Supernatural/Modern Fantasy\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Southern/Mid-Western/Urban Gothic\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Modern Mythology/Fairytale Retellings\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Sci-fi\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Superpowers/Gifted\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(As a side note, I *don't* do slice of life plots.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll my characters will be adults and I require my partners to do the same, as there will be adult themes in my writing. **For more plot and genre ideas, message me** \\^\\^  I can write over email or discord, and if we click I'd be happy to give out that info.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease be detailed when you message me, let me know why you chose to contact me.

            "selftext": "Heya! Feeling locked in with a dangerous monster lurkering outside? Me, too! So here's a theme to work with: think Predator meets Pitch Black.\n\nKappa-6 is a colony world by definition alone. In reality, it's a scattering of mining operations with pockets of shabby towns built up around them, grinding up ore to process and stockpile until the next company ship stops by to load it up, hand out some meager paychecks, and buzz off for another few months. Life is simple, straightforward, and a man knows who he is there.\n\nAt least, that's how it was until two weeks ago when the Hunters came.\n\nNo one's sure if they're indigenous to Kappa-6 or another species (well, collective of species) that fell in from off-world, but as soon as the system's harsh sun falls, the hunt is on. The invaders prowl the long shadows at night, stalking any of the workers unfortunate enough to be caught out someplace the Hunters can find them. They're intelligent, they're stronger and faster than the average human, and their motive is entirely unknown. But they seem to enjoy the sport of it. Survival is the name of the game now.\n\nMy character is a contract mechanic who's been on the planet for a few years now. She's been scraping by these two weeks by the skin of her teeth, putting her skills to use in exchange for protection and supplies as she makes her way across the towns of Kappa-6 towards the shipyards before the next off-world ship stops in for a cargo pickup. Your character can be whatever you like: a criminal, a miner, a member of the security force, an admin... Just so long as we're both humans trying to survive!\n\nObviously this is a bit of a horror vibe, and probably has some action. That said, if you would like to add in anything else, I'm totally game to discuss (takes two to tango, after all!) If you're interested, please shoot me a DM! (I don't answer comments here and I don't usually remember to check the chat. Fair warning.)\n\nI hope you're keeping safe indoors! Thanks for reading!",

I use discord only and I\u2019m open to other ideas as well. Just hit me up with a genre and we can talk about it. Below are a few prompts I have. \n\n1930s gangster- Jason Tate has robbed over 12 banks and numerous small shops all over the Chicago area. He uses a disguise as being an heir of a company that he built. He placed his father in charge and uses that as a front. He is one of the most known gangster despite only being 19. He justifies what he does by saying he is only providing his parents with a life that they could never give him. \n\nKnight- Joshua Kane was the greatest knight of the Kings palace. He was the Kings most trusted follower. Then one day the kingdom is sacked and the king has been killed. The knight finds himself outside the kingdom being attended to by your character( low fantasy: a few dragons, demons, and that\u2019s about it) \n\nCollege- Erin Cormac is a freshman in college. A country boy that left his desert home to make his life better. He has no idea what city life is like and sticks out like a sore thumb.",

That's right, if you have an established world or want to start putting serious thought into your world what better way to flesh it out than to place a character that knows almost nothing about your world, into the said world! All worlds are welcome, cyberpunk, sci-fi, fantasy, a mix of different genres, whatever! If it's your creation then don't be afraid to give it a shot with me!\n\nI will be your player character, obviously, though who I am, what I do, what I'm DOING, is completely up to you.

My only real requirement is that you use Discord, are over the age of 18, and are literate enough to write a few paragraphs worth of writing! I dislike one-liners with a heated passion unless necessary for the plot!\n\n1.) Star Wars (Specifically Clone Wars or the Galactic Civil War - I'll be using either an ARC Trooper or a Shadow Trooper!)\n\n2.) Half Life (I love the games. You'll start to see a trend of me wanting to shove in OCs.)\n\n3.) Halo (OCs, naturally but I don't mind if you want to play a canon character!)\n\n4.) Wolfenstein (Mainly OCs)\n\n5.) Doom (I'd say OCs but I'm curious to see if I could play the Doom Slayer)\n\n6.) Or anything action based! It can range from the apocalypse, the Military, something simple and easy to get into! I have OCs for them.\n\nIn terms of pairings, I'd prefer to stay MxF. I know that my last post specific I was able to play female characters buuuuuuut papa's not in the mood for it lately. [Insert shrug here, sorry boys.] I also ask that my partners be able to post at least 1-2 times a day but I understand if life gets to you! OOC contribution is also something I'd like to add in, just to add input to plot or suggestions for things!\n\nSo romance is a thing and I don't expect it to be IMMEDIATE and sudden. But if it is, I don't mind! Just that we throw curves and epic vices to make things cooler!\n\nFor Note: If I don't get to adding you back on Discord immediately, I'll get to you soon! Life is a thing, of course!\n\nPlease PM your Discord and possibly what you're interested in writing! I hope to see you soon!",

            "selftext": "Angela was, what her friends like to call, the belle of the ball. Truly the most frilly and dainty girl in the whole school, dresses, makeup, sucking at sports, the whole nine yards. But people that knew her liked her for her. She had no shortage of friends and interested parties, but she had a well kept secret. She was already in a relationship. \n\nHer girlfriend was a very stark contrast to herself and mildly standoffish to the public, but when it was just the two of them, she gave all of her attention to Angela and acted like an entirely different person. Which Angela thought was adorable. But as much as she wanted everyone to know about them, her girlfriend was much less keen on the idea. Despite her best efforts, Angela couldn't convince her otherwise. But she was happy with her and that was all that mattered. \n\nShe did manage to convince her to meet her parents once, and they welcomed her with open arms. Every so often, Angela would bring her home, make dinner, all that fun stuff. Though she was nervous to take things a little bit too far too soon. She wanted to wait until marriage. She was old fashioned like that. But otherwise, she did her absolute best to keep her girlfriend happy and cared for. \n\n*There's some groundwork, now I'll put a fairly basic starter.*\n\nAngela stood in front of the school with her friends, chatting and occasionally laughing about goings on at the school. Drama with boys, the usual. She felt her phone buzz in her purse and when she looked at it, her smile didn't fade in the slightest. She loved getting even such a simple message. 'Wanna meet at our spot?' She always responded with a heart and kiss emoji. Bidding her friends goodbye, she went back towards the school. \n\nThere was a section that used to house the theater class, until the school was cut funding for it. Now it was just extra storage and tucked away in one of the corners. Their spot was on the far side, where no one would easily see them and she wouldn't ruin her clothes getting to. Once there, she took out a small vial of strawberry lip gloss and applied it, looking at herself in her small mirror. \n\nOnce the object of her affections showed up, she put her purse down on the floor by her feet and let the other take her place against the wall, where Angela leaned in and rested her hands on the other's shoulders. \"You're such a chicken, hun. Nobody's gonna judge us, you know.\" She teased the other's lips with one finger. \n\n*So yeah, there it is. What I want is a secret relationship between these two and how complicated things will eventually get after school is over and whatnot. This isn't meant to be a perfect world, I'd like everything that comes with these sorts of things. Drama, romance, maybe angst. Bonus points if your character has insecurities about anything. Anyway, looking forward to hearing from some of you.*",

I'm hoping someone on reddit will be willing to take the plunge with me.\n\nI would love, love, love to write her against Harry, exploring the way they develop a friendship and then more after the war when Draco comes out and they both grow up and find common ground. I'd also totally write her against Hermione or other canon characters!\n\nAs always, please be over 20 or so if you contact me. I'm in EST, online fairly frequently, though I will take breaks from time to time, and I like to be friends with my rp partners. \n\nIt's also totally fine if you've never written against trans characters before!

I would love to hear any of your ideas for how to spin this, whether it's in an OC world or a fandom of your liking.\n\nI write third person, in the past tense, and in multiple paragraphs at a time. Usually I find it more fun if my partner takes the \"GM\" role but I'll compromise on that, of course. Additionally, Discord is the only medium I'll use for writing.\n\nHope to hear from you soon!",
