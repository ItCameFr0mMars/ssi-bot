I'd like to keep this post short and simple, so let me get straight to the point.\n\n~\nThis world takes place years after a nuclear war. Some small civilizations sprung up here and there, but the world is mostly a barren wasteland. As an extra pain to deal with, some areas are so radiated that creatures and people that lived there turned to hideous and viscous creatures. These harsh conditions caused people to do some shady stuff, such as a well known organization known for taking babies from weaker families and raising them into pawns that work for them mindlessly.\n~\n\nAge, gender, experience, etc doesn't matter. As long as you can type 3+ sentences, have decent grammar, are at least 13 years or older, and don't go crazy with op characters I'll be more than happy to write with you. My PMs are open, but you can always ask for my discord if you prefer that.\n\nI'm also open to do other roleplay ideas, (including fandoms but you'll have to ask) so if you have any ideas send them my way!",

That's right if you have an established world or want to start putting serious thought into your world what better way to flesh it out than to place a character that knows almost nothing about your world, into the said world! All worlds are welcome, cyberpunk, sci-fi, fantasy, a mix of different genres, whatever! If it's your creation then don't be afraid to give it a shot with me!\n\nI will be your player character, obviously, though who I am, what I do, what I'm DOING, is completely up to you.

My job is very demanding, and for the next couple of months my schedule will change every few weeks. I'm also a F, early 30s. Please be 18+.  \n\nAnyway! I've had a major itch to get something going in the fantasy realm. I have one character in particular that I've been dying to write again, and am completely open to any suggestions / ideas / changes. I also love using visuals, gifs, music, etc.. and would *love* to have a slow-burn romance involved, along with some epic battles.  \n\nFor a brief synopsis, she's half-fae, and is the daughter of a lesser ruler in a seaside village. Think Lords or something... Someone far beneath kings and queens. Anyway, the sleepy village is a haven for many, and was quite peaceful until the invasion. It was a reach for power, as well as a slaughtering of elves, many of whom were living within Relitium. M/C's father perished during the ensuing battle, while she risked her life and limb to aid as many elves to escape as possible.      \n\n*Hooves thundered overhead, their huddled forms curled over themselves in fear. Atop them dirt and dust fell, the crumbling wooden bridge above barely a match for the racing stream of soldiers headed for Relitium\u2019s center. Soon they would seek her, and soon they would find her answering to their beck and call, but no sooner than when she was ready.*\n\n*Only once the last horse passed did Moriah dare lift her head. Eyes of burnt orange reminiscent of a deep sunset peered over the terrified crowd. Every one of them, even the children towered over her the moment they rose at her insistence.*\n\n*\u201cTo the hills,\u201d she instructed as they clung to her every word as if it were from a God above, \u201cdo not turn back and do not stop until you have reached the caves. There Bettina will meet you and show you the rest of the way.\u201d*\n\n*Around her a young boy\u2019s arms swung, clenching her tightly to his chest.*\n \n*\u201cThank you,\u201d he murmured, melting her heart and soul.*\n\n*\u201cThank me once you and your mother are safe upon Aspora\u2019s shore.\u201d To his cheek her hand lifted, their passing smiles the last bit of encouragement she could offer.* \n\n*\u201cNow go, and be swift!\u201d* \n\n*Away they pulled, the towering Elves fleeing for their lives. One day they would again find freedom among Sanestris\u2019s soil, but for now, she had the King\u2019s envoy to deal with. Whatever they desired she would provide, but never, would she utter a single word regarding the countless lives she\u2019d fought to save. Always, they would be her secret.*\n\n--- So! I'm totally open to ideas. Want to be a different fantasy race? Cool! Maybe one of the bad guys? One of the elves? Someone from her home? A random traveler? I'm totally open... Please, don't feel like you can't make suggestions because I've got some concrete ideas, because I really don't. Send a message, and we'll see what we can come up with.",

I am craving something a bit dark but wouldnt turn down something fun and fluffy either!! Given that these are romance plots i will not roleplay with anyone under 18 years of age and i would prefer older than 25.\n\nMy ideal partner is Creative and descriptive, i write in 3rd person though on rare occasion i can do 1st. My replies are anywhere between 1 and 3 paragraphs depending on the story needs so please no 1 or 2 liners :) lastly I have been working from home so please be understanding if i can reply right away unfortunately life is still going on\n\nI also like roleplaying on discord but would be willing to use reddit DMs as well\n\nIf you are interested in RP shoot me a DM or chat with a character your interested in play or scene idea and i will get back to you ASAP! And please put a bit of effort into your message. Im not a picky person when it comes to grammer or even spelling ( i get how it goes ) but i dont like lazy. If you send me a message with \"Still interested\" i probably wont reply\n\nThanks again Hope your hear from you soon!!",

This play would encompass the different story arcs in the Legend of Zelda timeline. This way everyone would be able to have the adventure, in the time and place, as well as with whatever characters we so choose.\n\nThis being a new adventure, original characters would be very welcome. Maybe as traveling companions, adversaries, who knows. I'm very open to criticism, and willing to work to build a universe we can both live, and thrive in. I'm looking for a whole lot of adventure, as well as adult content. \n\nI would like to begin inside the OoT timeline, with Link returning the master sword but instead of returning to child Link form he is thrown into a parallel timeline. Why has this happened? All he knows is \"the voice.\" He hears it as he is pulled through time and space. Directing his path as he finds himself on a new quest to uncover the reasons behind this series of events.\n\nHe'd placed the sword into the pedestal so many times, without ever having trouble before. Who is behind this, and what do they want with the Hero of time? With that I would like to have Link forced to find different objects, from different time lines. In each time line he arrives in, he takes the form of the Link from said universe. As for an original character, maybe someone is pulled into this quest with him. Or maybe they run into each other in an alternate timeline and find themselves looking for the same thing. Really hoping to find a female interested in the Legend of Zelda series of games.",

            "selftext": "Hello all! I'm very single roleplay partner-wise, and have been following my RP partner of 6 years ghosting me about a year ago. I am 22 years old, and will only roleplay with someone 18+, due to the fact that I love romance in my roleplays and they sometimes take a NSFW turn.\n\nI have over 200 OCs to roleplay with, all with differing genders, sexualities, personalities, and designs. I do not mind creating more for particular roleplays. I love worldbuilding as well. I'm going to be completely honest here, and confess that I'm the type of person who can get very distracted from roleplaying if it's losing my interest. I would really appreciate a partner who would be understanding of that, and wouldn't mind starting different RPs if I, or we, were to lose interest in one. I think that if we enjoy eachother's writing styles and interacting with one another, it would be a lot of fun to mix and match pairings and scenarios/plots. That's the biggest thing for me, really.\n\nI enjoy all types of fantasy RP, and am okay with basically any type of roleplay as long as there is relationship building. I love romance, as previously mentioned, and that cannot be lacking in the roleplay or I will not be interested. I am cool with slow-burn, as long as the romance is there at least at some point. As far as plots go, I love trying all sorts of things and am pretty good at working with my partner to come up with something we both would enjoy. I also do not shy from darker themes. Basically, I'm very flexible. My roleplaying style is literate/paragraph, and I usually write in the present tense as follows: Looking down, she sighs. \"Okay, I guess. That'll have to do.\" It was hard for her to accept, but she pushes onward despite that. (I don't really care which tense we use, whether it be past or present. Present is just my personal preference.)\n\nIf you're interested by this ad and would like to get to know me and to discuss scenarios/plots, characters, anything, please don't hesitate to give me a holler! I am very active though I never post, and I am always logged into my preferred method of communicating/RPing (Discord). Thank you so much.",

            "selftext": "\\[ This post includes a little trick to make sure people read it properly and don\u2019t end up quitting roleplay early on because they didn\u2019t read it thoroughly ; ) }\n\nMy name is L, I\u2019m almost 22 years old and I\u2019m looking for some new roleplay partners. I\u2019ll most likely come off kinda negative and unfriendly in this post, but I promise I\u2019m not. I\u2019m just kinda over people wasting my time and energy, so I\u2019m going to be very clear as to what I do \\*not\\* want as well as what I\u2019m looking for.\n\nGUIDELINES:\n\n\\- 2 day limit. I\u2019m an active writer. It\u2019s fine if something comes up, just tell me. I will always ask if something is going on, but I\u2019m not about to do it 20 times x) If I can\u2019t make the two day limit, I\u2019ll let you know. If you know you can't manage a 2 day limit at least 97% of the time, I'm not your guy.\n\n\\- At least 10 sentences per reply. The longer the better.\n\n\\- 3rd person. No text talk. Proper English.\n\n\\- MxM pairings only. I don't care about your real-life gender ; )\n\n\\- Genres I write are; romance, slice of life, drama, angst.\n\n\\- You must be 18+ in real life. I include youknowhat content in my roleplays.\n\n\\- I'm strictly interested in manly characters - looks and personality-wise. This doesn't mean that your character can't be unsure or isn't supposed to feel anything, but I'm not into extremely shy, anti-social or feminine characters\n\n\\- Real-life face claims only that match the criteria above.\n\n\\- Characters I play are usually between 23 - 29 age-wise.\n\n\\- I'm the master of plots. Honestly, I can suck them right out of my thumb. However, this usually means I'm coming up with all the ideas and what not; I love it when I'm not the only one thinking about the plots since we're writing it together after all! Don't be shy about your ideas because I'd love to hear about them.\n\n\\- If you're someone who can't be honest when they don't like someone and would rather ghost than talk about it, don't add me. Start the msg you send me with \u2018ice cream\u2019 to prove you\u2019ve read this properly ; )\n\nIt's a plus if you enjoy talking outside of the roleplay as well as constantly coming up with ideas and shipping our characters : )\n\nIf you're interested in writing, please shoot me an introduction here.\n\nHappy writing! : D",

I prefer 20+.\n\n\u00a0\\-I'm a relaxed person, and I won't come for blood if you don't reply immediately. I might pm you to see if you're still interested if it's been a week or two, but I'll more than likely let ya ghost. If you stop replying and want to keep going with the same plot or start something new later on, let me know. No hard feelings.\n\n\\-I prefer to RP over discord or email (slight preference for discord).\u00a0\n\n\\-I write only third person past tense in paragraph format. My average post is probably 2-5 paragraphs or longer if I'm feeling it. I\u2019ll send you samples if you want.\u00a0I\u2019m not too worried about post length as long as there\u2019s enough to keep it rolling.\n\n\\-I'm relaxed about grammar, spelling, and that type of thing. If I know what you're saying, we're good.\n\n**Final Fantasy 7**\n\n\\-Favorite characters to write: Vincent, Zack, Kadaj, and Reno (**Strong**\u00a0preference for Vin and/or Zack at the moment). I'll play just about anyone as a side.\u00a0\n\n\\-AU and canon settings welcome. I typically prefer settings after AC and DoC.\n\n\\-OCs welcome, but I'd prefer you also take on a few canon characters to help move the plot along.\u00a0\n\n\\-I'm perfectly happy planning which characters we each want to write and going into it without specific pairings in mind. But here are a few of my faves.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0**Favorite pairings:**\u00a0\n\nItalics=role \n\n*Vincent*/Cloud\n\n*Vincent*/Cid\n\nVincent/Weiss\n\n*Vincent*/Shalua\n\n*Reno*/Cloud\n\n*Reno*/Rufus\n\n*Reno*/Rude\n\n*Zack*/Cloud\u00a0\n\n**Plots:**\n\n\\-I have a plot idea for a post DoC RP where Vincent loses control of Chaos and some of the dead come back to life. I tried before, and it was going to be like a Zack/Cloud/Vincent with me playing Zack and Vince, but it died off.  (If you do this one with me, I'll love you forever. If you let me have Valenwind in it, I\u2019ll lose it. lol)\u00a0\n\n**If I don't mention an interest in your favorite pairing, or the character you'd want me to play isn't one of my faves, don't be afraid to hit me up anyway.**\n\nIf anything here sounded interesting to you, dm me. Make sure you let me know any pairing or plots you\u2019d want and where you\u2019d like to RP. \u00a0Hope to hear from you! &lt;3",

I've decided that taking up some writing in my abundant spare time would benefit me! I  have been roleplaying for many years and prefer to write literately. This means more than just one sentence. I tend to write at a minimum of two paragraphs, sometimes more if needed. I'd prefer someone closer to my age to write with. I don't do sexual NSFW themes but I am all for gore and violence (A zombie apocalypse is not complete without it...).  \n\n\n  \nAs you can tell from reading the title of this post- I have been itching to dive into a zombie apocalypse rp. As far as what types of zombies we go for, I have no real preference. They can be slow moving or devilishly fast... etc. If you have an idea you want to discuss I am all ears! Otherwise we can just be traditional.   \n\n\nI love having a slow build up for romance. I prefer MxF pairings.   \n\n\nIf this interests you please do shoot me a message! Tell me a little about yourself and if you have any ideas you want to share. Thanks for checking in!   \n\n\nI use discord-!",

I\u2019m looking for anyone wanting to do a fun role play with me! This role play I\u2019m wanting to do is something I\u2019ve been wanting to do for ages! Anyway let\u2019s get into it!\n\nIn this role play, you and I have to decide on a handful of things. First of all, do we want to be Templars attempting to take hold or control a certain place, or just do bad guy stuff. Or do we want to be with the Assassin\u2019s and be a member of the Creed, trying to stop the Templar\u2019s reign of terror and control. Once again, it\u2019s our choice.\n\nNext, where and when? We could be running through the trenches of world war 1, breaking lines of British red coats, even boarding massive pirate ships in the Caribbean. That\u2019s the beauty of the Animus, we can be wherever we want at whatever point of time to discover something for Modern society.\n\nI really hope you find this interesting as I\u2019ve been wanting to do this for ages. I wish you all to be safe and to have a great day or night. And hey, go to bed if it\u2019s too late, I mean it!",

I have multiple prompt ideas that I\u2019d like to play out. I am open to others Ideas as well so if you have any don\u2019t be afraid to tell me. I use Discord mainly though I could be persuaded to use other platforms. I like OOC chats as well if you would like. Now with that out of the way here\u2019s my prompts: \n\nZombie apocalypse- our characters have survived alone for numerous years. Now we have met and are forced to watch each other\u2019s backs because of a new threat that\u2019s arising.( could be a new type of zombie, rival faction, starvation threat, or just brought together by chance. )\n\n1930s gangster- Jason Tate has robbed over 12 banks and numerous small shops all over the Chicago area. He uses a disguise as being an heir of a company that he built. He placed his father in charge and uses that as a front. He is one of the most known gangster despite only being 19. He justifies what he does by saying he is only providing his parents with a life that they could never give him. \n\nKnight- Joshua Kane was the greatest knight of the Kings palace. He was the Kings most trusted follower. Then one day the kingdom is sacked and the king has been killed. The knight finds himself outside the kingdom being attended to by your character( low fantasy: a few dragons, demons, and that\u2019s about it) \n\nI am open to fandom ideas as well. Video games, books, possibly tv series. Just let me know. I am open to NSFW scenes to an extent. If you have any questions or ideas as well please let me know. I can provide a writing sample if you want as well.",

Whether trying to help small farming outposts to survive in this harsh radiated world, or exploring vast underground cities built in subway tunnels to protect the inhabitants from the radiation and monsters that thrive in this new world. I hope we can have fun as friends creating and enjoying this setting together, there are some other roleplays in my post history too. Feel free to ask about those.  \n\n\nI am looking for a female to roleplay with, that is my only real requirement. Everything else we can work out together, so please get in contact and I will give you my discord. I have been roleplaying for a while and I think I can create really interesting and entertaining worlds to explore (with your help).   \n\n\nHope everyone is staying with this virus and staying safe!

            "selftext": "**Synopsis:**  \nGilda is a world composed of many little islands. Each island has its own unique history, culture, and geography. This roleplay focuses on 'Satha', a land which serves as quite a melting pot for all that Gilda has to offer. It is here that one can interact with people from all walks of life. The rich, the poor, the powerful, the fools: you name it! Some have come from far away in search of a new life, others grew up on Satha and know no different. Unfortunately, some of the fantastical races have discovered that they cannot coexist. It has caused awful disputes which are leading to countless battles and bloodshed. The elves and the orcs struggle to get along the most, and everyone is privy to it. Won't anyone find a way to bring about peace? How many more must die until it's realized that life can't go on this way?\n\n**\u272d** We have a wide selection of races to choose from, and we're constantly adding new ones as we discover them IC!  \n**\u272d** This is a very malleable world, meaning everyone's actions can change the course of it no matter how new they are to the group. New lore has been added to accommodate hopeful new cast members in the past!  \n**\u272d** We have existed as a devoted group for nearly three years now.  \n**\u272d** Our core is 7 members and we hope to grow to no larger than 15 active members. We tend to take on three new people at a time so that we can really get to know each individual and help them assimilate into the RP better.  \n**\u272d** This is a **live roleplay** group, not forum or DnD. It means that you can let people know when you're around for rp, and whoever's available can sit down with you and have a session in one sitting. Sessions can last anywhere between 1 and 12 hours depending on how much fun you're having! (We're sleepless individuals haha)\n\n**Send me a message if you're interested and I'll toss you a discord link!**",

Other roles for females are fine, i just prefer the main characters to be males for a romance plot.\nAround a paragraph in length. I tend to lose momentum if given one liners often.. \nLiterate. Spelling mistakes are fine, but no abbreviations or broken english. \nThird Person.\nThis is a preference, but i enjoy if my partner is an artist as well and has their oc drawn. I do like to make art if i enjoy a rp, but faceclaims of someone elses art puts me off//I dont mind if you use them to describe an aspect of your character. \n18+. Just for a general rule in terms of gore/smut and language. \n\nPrompts/Themes.\n\nI generally enjoy dark themes. Gore, Vampires, ghosts or demons, its all up my alley. Im fine to discuss ideas with plots or character dynamics. I enjoy the plot as much as character growth, so i do like to plan this all out first. I dont generally like to use cannon universes, or sci-fi themes. \nI generally enjoy a universe where supernatural beings exist, but unbeknownst to the human kind. \n\nSo if this sounds interesting to you, please message me!

And by preferably I mean I won\u2019t roleplay with anyone over.\n\nI like romance role plays and I also like just friendly/sibling ones. I have a few ideas for both of them. Fantasy is an area of expertise for me, and if we need to roll for battles I can do that! I have an open mind for any kind of role plays, so don\u2019t hesitate to get obscure! I have a soft spot for slice of life, and perhaps some game fandoms\n\nIf you\u2019re interested, send me a pm and we can chat about it!",

            "selftext": "After being stuck in my house for weeks, I've decided that I want to write a grand, romantic adventure. I was thinking of two people dropping everything they know and have in life and they go on a grand roadtrip together. Maybe they don't know each other well: maybe they're old flames from high school that never got together, maybe they have mutual friends but never really hung out together, maybe they're strangers who only knew each other over Reddit posts? Maybe they are both running away from something and it eventually gets revealed? \u00a0\n\nI had the idea that they quit their jobs, take their money out of savings and buy a terrible car and travel together on a roadtrip. They stop at all of the weird roadside attractions, hitchhike on a train when their car breaks down, they meet interesting people along the way, they laugh their way down Route 66, they learn about each other as they go and fall in love; maybe they get married in the middle of a homeless tent camp and they buy the entire community pizzas? I want to write their friendship growing, the romance blossoming and their journey, wherever it takes them. \n\nI have ideas to play the male character, so I'm hoping you could play the girl for me! \n\nIf you are okay fangirling with me and making moodboards, playlists, and squealing about our characters and story, send me a message! \n\nHere's some more about me and my writing:\n- I write in third person, past tense. I'm a literate writer, with multiple paragraphs, leaning toward novella writing. \n- I write exclusively on Discord, we can make a server and write there! \n- I get replies in at least every other day but I tend to lean toward once a day. I can get multiple in if time allows but I am *not* a rapid fire writer. I also will tell you if I'm going to stop replying for a while and I hope you do, too.\n- From some bad experiences before, I now only feel comfortable writing with people who identify as female. I also would prefer to write with someone who's 18+, as I'm 25. Please don\u2019t lie to me about your age or gender identification. \n- I will not write NSFW until I get comfortable with you. Totally willing to write it but we have to have written a bit and be pals first. I do write violence and other themes, so please tell me if anything I'm writing is making your uncomfortable! We can talk about no-nos later. \n- I like to use faceclaims and describe characters, so if you are anti-faceclaim, that\u2019s cool! If you like faceclaims, awesome! Please don\u2019t pick a FC for me and I won\u2019t do that for you. \n- If you send me just \"hey wanna rp\" or just \"hey i saw your post and i'm interested!\" I am not going to reply, I'm sorry. If you post on this ad and say \u201cmessage me!\u201d I am not going to. I\u2019d rather you send me a message with something about you and your writing!",

The mages were just victorious at the Battle of Sodden Hill, a presumptive final stand by the Northern Kingdoms against the Kingdom of Nilfgaard, marking the apparent conclusion of the first Nilfgaard-Nordling war. Though the land is still in political turmoil, the victory has inspired hope in many, but also a fear of what repercussions might come. Geralt is searching for his ward, Cirilla, after the child fled the site of the Cintra massacre. Meanwhile, Yennefer, one of the mages of the battle, has disappeared. Now the world is riddled with foes, man and monster alike, and the heroes of this world must seek a balance to the chaos that prevails. What does destiny have in store for the heroes? Only you can decide.*\n\nThat was a brief story introduction for the server I\u2019m advertising.\n\nI\u2019m a member of a Discord text-based roleplaying server set in the Witcher universe, set roughly during the book/show timeline, with some things moved around here or there for the sake of the rp. Currently we are a canon-character only server, so that we can get the story moving along properly, but once most of the essential canon characters are filled we are open to allowing OC\u2019s. This should not dissuade you from joining, however, as the Witcher universe is vast and filled with a plethora of interesting characters that, while not your own original creations, are still very enjoyable and malleable, as they will be your characters.\n\nThe server is 18+ only, as it has adult content and language, but that is not the primary focus of the server; that is reserved to well-written, articulate and enjoyable posts that allow the authors to really engage themselves with each other and the world that they are writing in. If you are inexperienced in rp (which I assume none of you are, though I could be wrong) or unfamiliar with the world and its lore and would still like to join us, please do not hesitate. Our staff is helpful, friendly, knowledgeable and willing to walk you through everything you would want to know concerning rp\u2019ing and the server.\n\nAnyone and everyone is welcome with us, if we\u2019ve piqued your interest please DM me on here and I can send you our server link or answer any questions you may have. I look forward to writing with all of you soon!",

I'd also like to mention that I'm an adult in my twenties, and I'm not looking to play with anyone under the age of 18. Just a personal comfort thing, sorry if that affects you.\n\nWith that being said, let me outline a bit about myself before delving further into what I'm actually looking for. As said above, I'm a male in my twenties, with a good amount of years under my belt, when it comes to RP. I'm confident in the fact that I'm literate and detailed, usually able to churn out 2-3 paragraphs per post, depending on how inspired I am. On the note of inspiration, ho boy, do I have a lot of creative inspiration built up with the current state of the world. I'm getting a bit stir crazy, and honestly, I'm looking for someone I can also call a friend during these trying times. Writers need each other, you know?\n\nAhem. Anyway, what I'm looking for....isn't anything specific. I love fantasy, and romance is a must for me, so those are always things I use as a foundation for a plot. Everything else is up in the air. Want to play an elf on a grand adventure? Sure, by all means. Perhaps you're looking to just keep it small, between two characters in a large city. That's also cool with me. If you're willing to play a kitsune, however, you'll usually have my attention. Same goes for dragons in disguise, dark elves, and demonic entities, though hopefully not too extreme on that last bit. On another note, I'm a huge fan of Garo (both the anime and love action), and Kamen Rider, if anyone here is into those. Destiny (the game) is also cool, so I could definitely be persuaded to play in that universe, as well.\n\nEugh, this post has been shaky from go, I apologize. I'm a little sleep deprived, so Pardon me if I missed anything important. Please put your favorite color in the title of your message, so I can see that you got this far. I think that's all I have, in all actually, but please, don't just message me with a \"hey, I'm interested\". Nobody likes those kinds of introductions.\n\nRegardless, all of you lovely people stay safe and healthy, while the world is burning down.",

My day job is in the healthcare finance and I am married with a family. I have been RPing in different capacities and on different platforms for well over a decade. I consider myself very competent partner who prefers to give and receive detailed, multi-paragraph replies (probably classified between advanced and novella length).

I don't need you to be extremely knowledgeable about the premise of the show/comic! It's pretty simple to understand- all of the children have their own unique super human power, be it a curse or a blessing. I'm more interested in pinpointing a different characters (original- Not looking for someone to write for an existing canon character.) and asking the questions of what it's like living with super powers in a normal world.   \n\n\nAbout me: My name is Hannah. I'm 19 chilling at home during this whole pandemic. I love creative writing and have been role playing as a hobby for quite a number of years. I prefer literate writing- at least a couple of paragraphs with each entry. One sentence responses will bore me out of my mind. I also love conversing with my partners in OOC chat! I like to share memes and overall discuss the characters and potential plot ideas. I just want to have fun and make some friends on the side!   \n\n\nAs for characters, I'm more than willing to write for either the male or female role. Although I prefer FxM pairings. I don't care what you are irl! I enjoy romance mixed in, but it's not completely necessary. I'm A-okay with gore, but I prefer sexual themes at a low.   \n\n\nIf this interested shoot me a message! I'd love to hear from you and your thoughts!! I use discord for messaging.",

I prefer to play females in MxF pairings; I realize, however, that the majority of this site so far seems to as well.\n\nI'm down for mature themes and NSFW content, although I'm not looking for PwP and would prefer that we detail scenes that are important and make sense, fading to black for all other intimate points in our stories. \n\nThe short of it is, I'm looking for someone over 18 - preferably 21 - who has interesting characters, dialogue that leaves me wanting more, emotions and thoughts and feelings that make me understand why your character does what they do... I want that. As far as writing style, I will admit that I can be particular. In order to combat this, I'd like to offer one of my own writing samples for something you have so that we don't get super invested for things to only sputter and die out. As aforementioned, I am looking for someone to main a male character but I do like to provide supplementary characters that can end up becoming main characters of any gender or orientation.\n\nAs far as genres, I'm happy to report that I can be interested in almost anything with the right plot. However, my butter-and-bread would likely be medieval fantasy and modern gritty slice-of-life. As far as fandoms I am fairly limited, mostly to Dragon Age and Mass Effect. I'll place a word bank below and bold my cravings. I do have some plots but not many... and honestly they're just generic starters. So I'd love to get something together that we're both excited about, invested in, and can gush over.\n\n**love through loss** / **arranged marriage** / **modern** / **slice of life** /  \n**medieval fantasy** / gritty / detective x witness / **World War II**  \n**ancient civilizations discovered** / **enemies to friends** /\n\n**Hurt-comfort** / urban fantasy / **Slow-burn** / **1920's** / apocalyptic / post-apocalyptic  \ndystopian / futuristic fantasy / **\"forbidden\" romance**\n\nI prefer roleplaying over GDocs but can manage the annoying Discord limits.  \nI do have a Discord for OOC chatter, though.\n\nSo if we sound like a good fit, **PM me with a writing sample and a little about yourself, as well as your roleplay style**! Please don't post here as I likely won't see it.",

            "selftext": "*A scream of fright escaped her lips when an arrow flew by her head and lodged into the wooden wall of the hut. She shot up in a state of shock, her heart skipping a beat as she realised what was going on. They were under attack. The brunette frantically rushed out of bed, desperately searching for her shift to place on her naked figure. The cold ground against her bare feet made her shiver as she reached the carved wooden cot- withdrawing her five month old son.* \n\n*Thora ran from the hut, as the wife of a Jarl she lived in his house that had been built on a small hill from which they could overlook the whole village. The woman\u2019s emerald eyes widened in shock at the sight of the huts burning, the fire spreading across the land. She could not spot her husband anywhere but she knew he was there, fighting along with his warriors. The village below was engulfed in flames- the deafening sound of woman screaming forced Thora to choke on her own breath. How could this be?* \n\n*Thora\u2019s gaze was forced upon her son, cooing playfully in his fur blanket. She knew her duty as his mother was to keep him safe, she knew she needed to hide. Thora rushed to where the women were instructed to hide if they were suddenly invaded- an old storage house on the outskirts of the village. The woman handed her son to one of the elders before helping to barricade the wooden- door. First bolting it, then placing wooden crates to make the door harder to open. When they were finished they huddled together, praying to the Gods for their survival. And so they waited, scared, terrified to the bone as the sounds of a fight continued to rage outside of the wooden door.*\n\n*When the dreadful sound of fighting died down- the woman and elders sighed a breath of relief, all the while hoping that their tribe had won. Suddenly, the sound of something kicking against the door made her and all the other women of the tribe freeze - their hearts stilling in anticipation if it was one of their own or the enemy that had won. With one more powerful kick, the heavy door swung open, making her clutch her child closer to her chest, shielding it in case of danger as her emerald eyes went to whomever had just broken the door down.*\n\nHello, I\u2019m Maddie! I am looking for a partner that can either play as Thora\u2019s husband or one of the raiders that have attacked the village, while I\u2019ll be playing as Thora. I\u2019m looking for a literate partner who is 18+, and who can write 1-2, or more paragraphs in third person. I understand that at some point in the Roleplay, the length of responses he slightly shorter due to dialogue. \n\nIf you are interested, message me and we can exchange contact information.",

            "selftext": "## A Fallen Sun\n It's a discord roleplay based on the lore and ideas that made up the Kimetsu no Yaiba (Demon Slayer) world. It does not however, take place directly in the same world. This is because we prefer to take a slight spin on things as well as not have to worry trying to uphold the personalities and styles of many characters. Instead, we take the foundation and place in our own characters and creations in order to fill what\u2019s needed. Therefore, names like Muzan or someone like Tanjiro mean nothing and do not exist. Instead, we have founded our own characters to fill these positions.The general basis remains. For those unfamiliar with it all, no worries! Everything is explained here and you could easily fit in with no knowledge of the manga itself. Our lore however, does take a little twist on things. \n \n##What's the t wist?\n\nNow, for our twist. The demon slayer\u2019s are on the decline. As the years go on, the demon\u2019s have been progressing in their arts. Every new generation seems stronger and stronger. Demon arts have been expanding and becoming more destructive. Due to this, newer slayers have struggled to survive and fewer and fewer swordsmen survive to train new slayers. This is all combined with one terrifying feat. A demon who can cast an eclipse over the sun. Normally, a demon\u2019s art is instantly done away by the sun, but by some terrifying miracle, there\u2019s been a creature born who for a short time, can cast a total eclipse. This has allowed for demon\u2019s to assault at times nobody could ever expect, using surprise and overwhelming force to annihilate the ranks of the corps. Demon\u2019s once never banded together, yet slowly they began to group and attack. Forming entire packs that ripped through the ranks of the Demon Slayers. Now, slayers are not only hunting, but are being hunted.\n\n## Tl;Dr\n\nA Fallen Sun is a roleplay based around the ideas that crafted the demon slayer manga. It goes with a slight twist that the slayer's are slowly falling out, their ranks thinning as demon's numbers are on the rise. Atop of this, there is a demon now known to be able to cast an eclipse, which has lead to many devastating losses for the slayers who are now no longer solely the hunters, but are now being hunted too.\n\nhttps://discord.gg/7eVS5Sf",

I have a few loose ideas that we can work on fleshing out, or we can do something totally original. Welp, here are my rules:\n\n-When doing a Gorillaz RP, I like to play Noodle. Sorry if that\u2019s who you were hoping to play.\n\n-I write a lot; I\u2019m a literate writer who, when I\u2019m really deeply invested, can write about 6\u2019000+ character responses. While I like responses to be meaty, it needs to be filled with good quality things. Not all responses have to be that long, of course, it\u2019s just a good reference for length. Also, literacy does include proper grammar and spelling. Typos are natural, but don\u2019t make me decipher your messages. \n\n- I am completely down for romance and adore working with it. That being said, all characters must be 18+ for it. Don\u2019t try to ship with Phase 1 Noodle or anything. I am fine with most ships, just ask.\n\n-I get that everyone has a life, so I won\u2019t be upset if you get spacey. I try to respond minimum once a day, and I\u2019ll let you know if I\u2019ll be AFK. When we get in a good swing and I\u2019m free, I can respond within an hour or so of your message. \n\n-I try to become friends with my RP partners, so feel free to talk to me and be open. \n\nI think that\u2019s everything; if you are interested just let me know and we can hash things out. Have a great day :)",

            "selftext": "Hey!\n\nI want to keep this short and straight to the point. I'm Clara, 21, GMT+2. I am a literate writer and novella-style RPer (third person, past tense.) Won't go too much into what I look for in a partner, but you know the drill: good grammar, literate, 3-4 paragraph response, OOC-chat.\n\nAnyway, as for the plot I have in mind, I would like to RP something filled with lots of angst and drama. Maybe a failed couple who are always bickering back and forth, forbidden love between two people, etc. I am even willing to do an apocalypse/ post-apocalypse RP where the two characters keep getting into trouble, arguing, or simply not getting along.\n\nOf course, I want this to ease into romance or perhaps friendship, but you know, after a LONG time. So, yes, this will be a long-term RP, so make sure you are dedicated enough to carry that out. I dislike when people leave RP's midway.\n\nWhat I'm looking for: A male/female who has a stubborn/stoic/strict/hard-headed personality (loves arguing, can hold their own, etc). They are dedicated, strong-spoken, and aren't afraid of trivial things.\n\nI roleplay exclusively on Discord!\n\nIf this grabbed your attention, don't hesitate to send me a message and we'll figure the rest out over Discord! Alright, stay safe people! See ya.",

            "selftext": "Ohmygodthepandemicandisolationaredrivingmecrazy\n\nSo to escape all that I was re-watching the Nolan trilogy, which I dearly love, and remembered how much I love Catwoman/Selena Kyle. Specifically, Anne Hathaway's version, BUT out of fascination (and boredom) I've gone and familiarized myself with a lot of her historical lore. I find her fascinating. She does a lot of bad things for good reasons and makes very good points about classicism, and whether people are deserving of their wealth, and why *shouldn't* she have a right to take it? Why should she have to be poor? Why should Bruce Wayne have billions and she have nothing? Surely this one jewelry store won't miss a few necklaces...? They're insured ;) \n\nIt's my general understanding that in multiple plotlines in the comics Batman goes about trying to reform her; sometimes he succeeds, sometimes he doesn't. I think she's ultimately a good person at heart and I think she's more chaotic good than chaotic evil. (I'd call Batman lawful good if he didn't, uh, break the law so much, lol.) \n\nAnd like obviously I want romance. It's Catwoman and Batman. C'mon. \n\nI do not know if I want NSFW; I really want to focus more on the moral entanglement of their romance, the way they're drawn to each other and wanting the other to be on their side. I am of age, so it's possible, but I absolutely do not want a bunch of replies of people just shoving Batman's belt area in my direction. I want PLOT. It's possible DOWN THE LINE. \n\nThis isn't just a case of 'Batman is right and she's wrong'. They are both people, complex and nuanced, and I want to honor that. \n\nI would also not object to Batman capturing her. :3 JUST SAYING.\n\nI generally do 2-3 paragraphs per response and look for similar in my partners. I would like to roleplay over discord or reddit message. \n\nMessage me if you're interested, and it would be really helpful if you could send just a quick writing sample, to give me a sense of you? It can be a roleplay reply from something you've done before or you can do a quick 'here's my batman' paragraph if you want to. It just really helps me get a sense of you as a roleplayer and potential partner, so please include that in your message. Thank you!!!",

Not just a meager paragraph or a few lines with nothing that I can continue off of**\n\nIf for some reason you grow bored or disinterested please do let me know and we can fix it or try something else completely. \n\nI love chatting outside of RP whether it be about our characters, future plot points, coming up with characters in AU\u2019s or just general chat!

(more plot devices and interaction that way) \n\nCharacter interaction, development, and world building is a must!\n\nAlso, I do quite enjoy looking at characters from different angles even if that means switching between character POV in the RP, but if you\u2019re more of a one or two character interaction type of person that\u2019s fine, but I certainly don\u2019t mind playing side characters or extras to bring the world to life.\n\nI am interested in both fandom and original RPs right now so here is fandom first:\n\nI will put asterisks next to ones I am inspired for or that I know the most about.\n\n\n**Detroit: Become Human**  ***\n\n\u2014Characters I can and will play: (I will put asterisks next to who I am most wanting to play). \n\nConnor **\n\nGavin *\n\nRK900 ***\n\nHank, Tina, Chris, Fowler, Markus, Simon, North, Josh, Kara, Alice, Luther, Chloe, Kamski, Ralph, Jerry, OC, etc.\n\n**Pairings:** (I will put asterisks next to what I am most interested in). \n\nConnor x OC *\n\nGavin x RK900 ***\n\nGavin x OC \n\nRK900 x OC ***\n\nMarkus x Simon\n\nMarkus x OC\n\nKara x Luther\n\nKara x Connor\n\nChloe x Kamski\n\nOC X OC *\n\nBesides my m x m pairings, I do have a preference for a female OC if an OC is what you would like to use instead of a canon character. Nothing against anyone, it is just merely a preference. \n\n\nStar Wars *** (All of my knowledge comes from the movies and part of the newest game that I haven\u2019t finished yet and also The Mandalorian. I have not seen the shows.)\n\n**Characters**\n\nRey *\n\nKylo Ren/Ben Solo ***\n\nObi-Wan ***\n\nAnakin **\n\nMando *\n\nPoe, Finn, Padme, Luke, Leia, Han\n\n**Pairings**\n\nRey x OC \n\nRey x Kylo Ren/Ben Solo **\n\nKylo Ren/Ben Solo x OC *\n\nObi-Wan x OC **\n\nMando x OC *\n\nAnakin x Padme\n\n**Other Fandoms:**\n\nFinal Fantasy (4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10-2, 13, 13-2, 13-3, 15 and Kingsglaive, Dissidia, Crisis Core) \n\n\u2014Literally any canon character but I am most familiar with 6, 7 including CC and AC, 8, 9, 10/-2, 13/-2-3, and 15\n\n\u2014Currently would enjoy something revolving around 7 and playing Cloud ***\n\nTales (Berseria, Xillia, and Graces f) \n\nLegend of Zelda (MM, TP, WW, SS, BOTW, Warriors) \n\n\u2014Link x Zelda **\n\nTelltales The Walking Dead \n\n\u2014Clementine x OC *\n\nThe Last of Us (or similar universe)\n\nNier Automata (Or similar universe)\n\nSpider-Man (PS4 2018)\n\nFire Emblem (Fates, Warriors, Awakening and I haven\u2019t finished 3 houses yet)\n\nMarvel **\n\n\u2014most movies including Spiderverse and also Daredevil and The Punisher; not so much comics \n\n\u2014Looking to play Frank Castle, Peter Parker, Karen Page, or Natasha Romanoff as of right now, though I am open to suggestions\n\nPeter x OC **\n\nPeter x MJ\n\nNatasha x Clint **\n\nNatasha x Bucky (past) (Red Room) *\n\nNatasha x Steve **\n\nNatasha x OC **\n\nFrank Castle x Karen Page **\n\nFrank Castle x OC \n\nKaren Page x OC\n\nMatt Murdock x Karen Page \n\nMatt Murdock x OC\n\nFoggy Nelson x Karen Page\n\n**Sherlock**\n\n\u2014John x Sherlock *\n\n**Miraculous LB**\n\n**TWD**\n\nDaryl x OC *\n\nDaryl x Connie\n\n**RWBY**\n\nAU- Future or non-canon events (own story with canon or OC basically)\n\nSword Art Online Arc 1 and 2 (more the universe)\n\nSword Art Online Season 2 (more the universe)\n\n**Stranger Things**\n\nMike x El *\n\nJonathan x Nancy\n\nHopper x Joyce\n\nLucas x Max\n\n**Angel Beats** (Or similar universe) \n\n**IT**\n\nBill x Beverly *\n\n**I Am Not Okay With This (Netflix)**\n\nOCs\n\nStanley x OC\n\nSydney x Dina\n\n**Carnival Row**\n\nOCs\n\n**Hobbs and Shaw**\n\n\u2014Hattie or Deckard as MC/Paired with OC\n\n**Disney**\n\n\u2014Generally Tangled or the Frozen universes\n\n\u2014Perhaps even a darker take?\n\n**Teen Titans (The cartoon)**\n\nOC or Canon\n\nStarfire x Robin\n\nBeast boy x Terra\n\nBeast Boy x Raven\n\n**The Seven Deadly Sins**\n\nMeliodas x OC\n\nMeliodas x Elizabeth\n\nKing x Diane\n\n**John Wick**\n\nJohn x OC\n\n\n**Not a complete list of fandoms**\n\n\nOriginal ideas I enjoy: (Plot and character ideas depend on your preferences) I have prompts, OCs, etc. but it\u2019s more up for discussion. \n\n**Fantasy** (medieval, magical elements, kingdoms, different races and disputes, even adding in tech like airships, modern weapons/magic infused weapons, and exploring more than one and a variety of aspects as well. There\u2019s so much more I could add but it would take forever.)\n\n\u2014war themes, royal themes, different aspects of life themes, pirates, bandits, arranged marriages, bodyguards and mercs, etc etc etc.\n\n\u2014I do often like having a unique twist to these as well that stray away from the normal fantasy setting like adding in modern or advanced tech, give magic a more modernized or manufactured aspect.\n\n\u2014Modern settings and futuristic/sci-fi settings as long as they have some sort of non slice of life or non day to day type aspect. I like action and adventure in these types of settings.\n\n\u2014Modern cities, crime families, vigilantes, dystopian society, unique individuals with secret abilities in the world, secret government/lab conspiracies, people being caught in crossfire, or any sort of other unique twist.\n\n\u2014Supernatural/Fantastical elements\n\n\u2014Post apocalyptic\n\n\u2014Romance (MxF and possibly FxF and I DO NOT RP SMUT. More of a fade to black sort of person) I also thoroughly enjoy building it up over time.\n\n\u2014Action/Adventure\n\n\u2014Angst/Drama\n\nFor original plots I\u2019d love to find someone that can build an interesting cast of characters and an equally interesting world with me. Characters that we can both grow to adore and put as much growth into and build different relationships with different dynamics. Worlds with bustling life and lots of different things going on, and a plot that has many twists and turns as we go along! (: \n\n**I have an original plot listed on my profile from a previous post, but I do have a list of others in various different genres.**\n\nI am sure there are more things I am forgetting. \n\nI would be fine exploring any other sorts of themes/plots genres except Slice of life (normal themes would need some convincing as I find it difficult to keep it going) as I like some sort of magical or fictional aspect to it. I can be persuaded depending on the plot.\n\nIf you have any other suggestions/ideas/plots/settings as to what you would like to do then please shoot me a PM with a bit about you and your interests and we can discuss! Give me a bit about your interests and preferences! I am open to nearly anything! Please do not just message me asking if I\u2019m still looking or if I wanna RP, give me a summary or what you\u2019d like to do! (: \n\nIf you need a sample of my writing, please do not be afraid to ask! \n\nI do have a large list of OCs for original RPs if you would want that.\n\nI do have a list of plots both original and fandom if you would like to see those as well! (With the one on my profile) \n\n**For fandoms I have a plot idea for Stranger Things, D:BH, Star Wars, BOTW, Telltales TWD, and Final Fantasy.**\n\nBy no means are any of said plots set in stone. Please come at me with both original or fandom plots/ideas if you have them. Share characters with me or whatever else you happen to be fancying right now. Or if you\u2019d like to brainstorm one together that is fine as well!\n\nMy platforms are Kik, Discord, Skype, Email, Google Docs and Reddit PM",

            "selftext": "Good day all. Hope we are doing well in these troubling times. I'm hoping to find a partner to create a long term rp with, based in the Star Wars universe. I have a couple of ideas in mind which I will briefly summarise here. I will be playing original characters as I personally don't want to risk getting one wrong and I like the idea of building and sculpting a blank canvas, however I'm happy to have my partner play whoever they would like.\n\n(1) Set between episodes 3-4. After the slaughter of the Jedi created by Order 66, it was believed all the Jedi and their younglings were destroyed. However, one youngling managed to slip away undetected. He grew up isolated on a moon, staying undetected by the Emperor's watchful eye. Perhaps your a bounty hunter, a random stranger who stumbles across me. I'll leave that to you.\n\n(2) This can be set in any time. My character is the average smuggler and trader, getting whatever I can get my hands on for a healthy payout of credits at the end of the day. All I care about is money and I'll stop at nothing to get it. Plenty of options for this one for your character. \n\nAny other ideas are. It's then welcome and I'd love to hear them if you do. I personally prefer to write in the third person as well. I have good grammar and would appreciate the same back, writing at least one full paragraph a time. Thanks for your time and have a nice day.\n\n(3) Space battles are fierce and deadly with losses on both sides. In this scenario, MC is a pilot who's ship takes heavy damage. Through luck, maybe a slight bit of skill he gets caught by the gravitational pull of a nearby planet and crashes on its surface. Your character could be a local who finds him. Any time line would suit this story. Although I like the idea of trying out a clone who has the moral dilemma of either finding a way back to his ranks and brothers or turning his back on the war he was created for.",

            "selftext": "Hello!\n\nThanks for taking time to look at this, and if you couldn't tell, this is a server for roleplay. The plot centers around a \"What-If\" scenario, and the main characters are elementals.\n\n**Here's a summation of the synopsis:**\n\n&gt;It's an anime-vibe role play set in Japan on an alternate time-line Earth. Certain individuals are born with a special gland that is active at birth which allows them to have influence over a certain element. In this world, Elementals are taken from their parents into special \"Caring Facilities\" at birth and raised until they're old enough to become Runt Soldiers in \"Training Camps\", where our story focuses. Elementals are not accepted in mainstream society and are expected to be tools of war. The way elements are manipulated in this story remains rooted in science and the laws of physics, and not quite fantasy/magical elements. Things move, hold momentum, and have the properties they naturally would. \n\nThere's a lot to it, but that's a simple overview! There's much more lore available in the server and moderators and members are usually always around to answer questions.\n\nThere are a multitude of elements to choose from or earn! And many open ranks to pick from as well. Though it doesn't matter what you may possess, anyone will be able to make an impact. Here, you don't automatically have to be strong to be important.\n\nElemental Human Group RP, Military setting &amp; plot, Anime-Oriented, New, 18+, Literate roleplay.\n\n***If you are interested, please DM for the Discord Link!***",

            "selftext": "I'm a trans girl looking to do a lesbian vampire romance story, I have a reasonably fleshed-out plot in mind, and while it doesn't take place in the same kind of setting as many fantasy stories, it still retains many elements themes, such as supernatural characters.\n\nFirst thing's first, the setting- A supernatural high school, as in, the students aren't exactly normal humans. Everything ranges from human based, such as witches, to generally non-malevolent entities such as faeries, to more \"dangerous\" entities such as vampires, to spiritual entities such as ghosts. It takes place in a modern setting.\n\nThe genres- There's a lot here and if any don't look interesting, feel free to say you want to drop that genre, save for the necessary romance and setting-required supernatural. I've been toying around with romance, drama, horror, supernatural, and musical. Note that with musical, I'm not asking you to write your own music. The idea I had is that real songs would be used, only they'd be original to the characters in-universe unless otherwise stated.\n\nMy character- Hinata \"Hana\" Aki, a 16 year old human who's sent to the school by a mistake from her parents. She's a former Final Girl, as in, a few months before transferring, she was the sole survivor of a homicidal maniac's rampage. This leaves her with guilt and depth as she has to learn to overcome her past while dealing with her newfound feelings of love. She also has a major interest in vampires and vampirism. She'll be played in 3rd person.\n\nLiteracy level not needed- I'll like do anything from a single sentence to a full paragraph or two at any given point, so I won't judge how anyone else wants to do it.RP will take place on Discord, PM me if interested.",

A pirate captain coming across an injured person, bringing them on board to nurse them back to health\n2. A ship on a journey through a dangerous cove, full of mermaids and sirens (of varying genders), all seeking out male flesh, save for one who doesn't believe in harming humans\n3. A rival ship attempting to capture the ship to loot and take their treasures once they somehow cross paths\n4. A determined townsperson, wanting to go on a journey with the crew, to prove they have what it takes to be a successful pirate\n\nAll plots are open to characters of all genders and have plenty of room for some form of romance, if that's what you're interested in! I am currently seeking out only female writers.\n\n I ask all partners be over 18, have a Discord to write over, be literate (I shoot for one paragraph per reply), be willing to give equal effort for a plot, and use real person faceclaims. NSFW is a possibility, but it won't be the main focus or driving force of a plot. \n\nIf any of these interest you, shoot me a message or leave a comment and we can flesh things out!",

I\u2019m currently trying to work on my descriptive language so if you\u2019re good with that, even better!\n\nWith plots, I\u2019m super flexible. I\u2019m not great with fandoms (I have limited knowledge of TV shows and stuff) and I work mostly with OCs, but I don\u2019t mind learning if it\u2019s interesting and can provide a good story! We can probably do whatever genre you\u2019d prefer, even multiple. If you have a world or plot of your own, I can jump in on that too. Like, I\u2019m ready to go, okay? All I ask is for effort, and maybe some passion.\n\nAs for myself, I do favor RPs that are NOT totally action-oriented. Describing fight scenes over and over\u2014it gets rough. I want to see our characters tick from the inside. I live for the drama.\nI\u2019m a big fan of fantasy (high or low), historical fiction, sci-fi, and the supernatural.. but like I said I\u2019m down for whatever.\n\nSend me a chat and tell me a bit about yourself and what you\u2019d like from a long term role play partner if you\u2019re interested. :)\n\nThanks!",

            "selftext": "It's been ten years. You start to forget the things you should remember.\nAnd you can't stop remembering the things you should forget.\nWe always had the power to fight. Not anymore.\nAll we have is each other.\n\nAt the first sign of the apocalypse people panicked, within days major cities became warzones or even empty. Many went into shelters and bunkers hoping to wait this all out.\n\nFirst came the bombs, I was 10 when they dropped them on the city above. We all day together huddled as the entire underground shook. Weeks after, things became quiet.\n\nSecond came time, within time one of our old folk had passed away in his sleep. There we found out the virus was in everyone and that when you die, you turn into one of them..\n\nThird came greed, after a third of us had turned from the older folk we had diminishing supplies. People turned into vipers and we turned on each other, soon it was just a few of us.\n\nNow it's just me, I sit here among these bodies. I can't remember their names but I know what they did. My supplies are out, with only two options left I choose the better one. Die in here or out in the world that I left 10 years ago.\n\nWell, I've been wanting to write this for such a long time. An apocalyptic type roleplay! How original! These are kinda overplayed on this subreddit which is why I've left sort of a vague feeling on what exactly happened and what the virus actually is.\n\nWhat I can offer is a detailed writer who excel's in meaningful storytelling and creative scenes. I marked this as NSFW because this Roleplay will be extremely dark at times and I need you to be okay with that.\n\nWhat I'm looking for in a partner is someone who is also very detailed and able to play a plethora of characters. I'm looking for someone who is a friend in OOC and isn't afraid to throw ideas to change the story or scenes. Someone who is able to world build with me would also be a treat.\n\nI only use Discord and will roleplay on nothing else, if you read all the way down here please put I want a Banana In Canada in your subject tag or your first message somewhere!",

( Before I go any further, I would like to clarify I AM a minor, for those who are uncomfortable RPing with minors )\n\nI\u2019d like to find someone to do a romance in the supernatural genre, but honestly I\u2019m pretty flexible, so I\u2019m good with about any genre! I\u2019m hoping that I can do a MxM pairing with the person I RP with, but I\u2019m okay with any pairing! Although I do have kind of an idea for something supernatural, so that might be a bonus. I\u2019m a big fan of drama and angst, even if it\u2019s cliche. And personally, I love to get to know my RP partner! Partially because I think roleplay is more fun if I know the person, and partially, it\u2019s easier for me to get comfortable around you if I know you! \n\nI can play both male and female characters, and multiple characters. I don\u2019t care about your irl gender, so don\u2019t worry about that! I RP in third-person and I can usually do about 1 ~ 3 paragraphs, based on what I\u2019m given, not including starters. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in RPing with me, don\u2019t be afraid to DM me, I don\u2019t bite!",

            "selftext": "It was perhaps one of Earth\u2019s greatest achievements ever: Prehistoric Park. A gigantic Island filled with hundreds of extinct species, ranging from Mammoths to Velociraptors. But as is somehow a trend with these Parks, on one fatal day, things go wrong and the animals usually kept in their beautiful exhibits run loose on the island. And of course, that just happens to be the day you are there...\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nHey guys! I\u2019m Rebecca, 25, looking for someone to join me in Prehistoric Park, ready to survive threats from all over Earth\u2019s long history. I will be playing as GM, so the world around you, while you would be playing as the star of the show, so to speak. Some pointers as to what to expect and what I\u2019m looking for:\n\n- Because of some bad experiences in the past, I\u2019m only looking to play with fellow women. I recognize not every guy is the same, but I\u2019ve been burnt once too much. I hope you understand and respect my decision.\n\n- I use (real life) reference pics for both characters and the animals you encounter. This means I also expect one for your character.\n\n- You don\u2019t have to be knowledgable on prehistoric animals whatsoever, neither am I. An interest in it is though of course, else I doubt you would really enjoy this RP.\n\n- I\u2019m only looking to RP on Kik or Discord, with the latter preferred. I\u2019m fairly active myself, especially in current times, so I\u2019m hoping to find someone is a similar situation.\n\nHope to hear from you soon!",

I'm looking for a literate roleplay set in the prequel era of star wars, but not like so heavy on accuracy and lore that it becomes unnecessarily stressful. You get what I mean? I want something laid back, I don't want to get yelled at for not being 100% canon (o;T\u03c9T)o \n\nSo, characters. I'm looking for...a hero! Someone with enough compassion to be able to bend the rules for the sake of what he thinks is right. (Psst; a little on the sensitive side wouldn't be too bad either (\u3003\uffe3\u03c9\uffe3\u3003\u309e) To be compleeetely honest, I really want to do this with my partner playing Qui-Gon, but I won't be picky. \n\nRequirements are simple. 3 paragraph minimum per response and...understanding if my ADHD brain shifts to another topic immediately. This is something I'm trying to work on. Just please don't hold it against me if I get distracted, I'm tryin' my best. \n\nPlatform would ideally be discord but I've also got google hangouts and gmail. I think that's it.

            "selftext": "Umbrella Academy inspired RP\n\n On one day in 1989, 43 infants are inexplicably born to random, unconnected women who showed no signs of pregnancy the day before. Seven are adopted by billionaire industrialist Sir Reginald Hargreeves . But what about the other 36?  \n\n\nI'm a pretty big fan of the Netflix show, Umbrella Academy, and thought it would be fun to dive back into that universe. Plot lines are very flexible. I don't need you to be extremely knowledgeable about the premise of the show/comic! It's pretty simple to understand- all of the children have their own unique super human power, be it a curse or a blessing. I'm more interested in pinpointing a different characters (original- Not looking for someone to write for an existing canon character.) and asking the questions of what it's like living with super powers in a normal world.   \n\n\nAbout me: My name is Hannah. I'm 19 chilling at home during this whole pandemic. I love creative writing and have been role playing as a hobby for quite a number of years. I prefer literate writing- at least a couple of paragraphs with each entry. One sentence responses will bore me out of my mind. I also love conversing with my partners in OOC chat! I like to share memes and overall discuss the characters and potential plot ideas. I just want to have fun and make some friends on the side!   \n\n\nAs for characters, I'm more than willing to write for either the male or female role. Although I prefer FxM pairings. I don't care what you are irl! I enjoy romance mixed in, but it's not completely necessary. I'm A-okay with gore, but I prefer sexual themes at a low.   \n\n\nIf this interested shoot me a message! I'd love to hear from you and your thoughts!! I use discord for messaging.",

I tend to stick with fantasy or historical settings and plots. \n\nBefore you message me, please;\n1. Be over 18. I\u2019m 20, so the reasoning should be self-explanatory. \n\n2. Don\u2019t be in it only for smut. \n\n3. Write in the 3rd person, and have responses between 2-5 paragraphs. (I\u2019m totally fine with shorter posts when there\u2019s little detail, as long as every post isn\u2019t like 2 sentences, y\u2019know?)\n\n4. Be able to RP on Discord. I use Reddit DM\u2019s to get details sorted, but I only do actual RP\u2019s over there. \n\n5. Be able to respond to any RP more than once a day. People get busy and that\u2019s totally fine if a break is needed, but the 1-post-every-day RP\u2019s tend to get tedious IMO. \n\nAaaaand that\u2019s about it.

A gigantic Island filled with hundreds of extinct species, ranging from Mammoths to Velociraptors. But as is somehow a trend with these Parks, on one fatal day, things go wrong and the animals usually kept in their beautiful exhibits run loose on the island. And of course, that just happens to be the day you are there...\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nHey guys! I\u2019m Rebecca, 25, looking for someone to join me in Prehistoric Park, ready to survive threats from all over Earth\u2019s long history. I will be playing as GM, so the world around you, while you would be playing as the star of the show, so to speak. Some pointers as to what to expect and what I\u2019m looking for:\n\n- Because of some bad experiences in the past, I\u2019m only looking to play with fellow women. I recognize not every guy is the same, but I\u2019ve been burnt once too much. I hope you understand and respect my decision.\n\n- I use (real life) reference pics for both characters and the animals you encounter. This means I also expect one for your character.\n\n- You don\u2019t have to be knowledgable on prehistoric animals whatsoever, neither am I. An interest in it is though of course, else I doubt you would really enjoy this RP.\n\n- I\u2019m only looking to RP on Kik or Discord, with the latter preferred. I\u2019m fairly active myself, especially in current times, so I\u2019m hoping to find someone is a similar situation.\n\nHope to hear from you soon!",

However, don't let the huge cast size scare you off! Given the roles these characters fulfill (villains, teachers, students of different classes, etc.), you will rarely be expected to play more than a few at once, as many characters will not receive the same level of \"screentime\" as others, and most of them will be introduced slowly enough. If the large pool of characters has not scared you off, then great! I think we will get along wonderfully!\n\nAs the title says, I am looking for a female roleplaying partner for a massive, long-term My Hero Academia RP set in an alternate universe of sorts where none of the canon characters ever existed. No Deku, no All Might, no All For One, no canon characters. The plot would mostly be a loose following of the canon storyline, or at least its events would serve as a sort of foundation upon which we can write our own plot.\n\nRegarding post size, I'm looking for a semi-literate or literate partner, but I don't need massive posts. A couple of sentences at minimum. Write whatever you're comfortable with! I am fine with the occasional one-liner, since I know sometimes there just isn't much happening, so long as it does not become the norm.\n\nIf anyone would be interested in undertaking such a big RP with me, please send me a PM! My timezone is EST, so if possible, I'd like to find someone within a few hours of my timezone, but this is not a requirement!",

            "selftext": "I've been cooped up for the better part of a month now, and you can only play so many games and watch so much Netflix before it feels like your brain is about to spill out through your ears. To that end, I'd like to stretch my writing muscles again doing some fan fiction type of roleplay, leaning more towards the AU side of things. Let me know if any of the following interest you, and we can go back and forth on a few ideas.\n\n* Resident Evil - Primarily the remakes of 2 and 3 as those are the freshest in my memory. Looking to do Ada x Leon, Claire x Leon, and Jill x Carlos in either Canon situations or more AU type of fluff. \n\n* Star Wars - I have some ideas for the cast of Jedi Fallen Order revolving around a modified ending of the game, since I think Trilla deserved a bit more redemption. The Mandalorian could be neat too.\n\n* Fallout - Looking to play a male OC opposite a female Sole Survivor/Brotherhood Knight in the FO4 Commonwealth. Also down for Canon/OC roleplay in New Vegas as it is my favorite in the series.\n\n* Divinity Original Sin - The Red Prince is my favorite character in OS 2 and while I enjoy the dynamic he has with Sebille the most, I won't say no to OCs accompanying the adventure on Fort Joy. \n\n* Skyrim - I have a female werewolf OC who I'd like to play as a loner in search of a \"pack\", so I don't mind doubling up on roles if you do to make it more of a party.\n\nOthers - Neon Genesis Evangelion, Nier Automata, Kill la Kill\n\nAbout Me:\n\n* I'm over 18, and hopefully you are too\n\n* I only play on Discord \n\n* I don't impose a hard limit on post length, but I'd rather not waste each other's time with one liners and ghosting\n\n* I have experience with long term RPs, and understand that real life comes first, which goes both ways\n\n* I prefer MxF pairings, and am comfortable writing either role\n\n* I like to engage in world building/ooc chat if we're taking things seriously, but also to get to know each other's preferences\n\n* I generally prefer playing canon characters to OCs, with exceptions \n\nStill reading?

            "selftext": "Hi, this is my first post here and also my first time creating a server in discord.\n\nSome little facts about me: I quit roleplaying a few years back and am starting to get back into it since the last few months. I have joined some other roleplaying groups (I prefer groups rather than 1x1) with some lasting for a month or so (either due to delayed replies or occasional motivation) but most not even lasting a month due to a multitude of factors (Admins mostly not enforcing the rules they made). So I tried making a server of my own, but the idea of starting a server was from a friend but he's not part of the server making process (He's helped in writing rules tho). Now I just need some members and a few other people to help write the other sections.\nI am 19 yrs old with a little over 6 years roleplaying experience, I mainly used roleplaying to learn English as I was terrible at it but I wanted to improve.\n\nA bit of lore about the world I'm building:\n\nIt has been a few milenia since a dragon has destroyed the world, it's attack on civilization has caused the continent to split in three, with other pieces lingering off. Only a few races have survived the extinction, only to die out as generations passed. All of the races except one, and that one race also has one survivor. He sits on a lonely island, ruling that isle for all eternity as he remembers everything he's lost while preparing for the return of that dragon. But unknown to him is that life has began to sprout from other lands, giving life to the world once more.\n\nThe three continents are populated by different races from different kingdoms, tribes, cities, villages, jungles, etc. And nearly all segments are ruled by a deity (Not the holy almighty god kind of deity but more of a living creature worshipped as a deity) and the climate and landscape is shaped based on those said deities. \n\nThe server is still far from complete, but I think it's filled enough for it to be played on.\nI also require other people to suggest different villages, cities, lore, monsters, etc. For the growth of the world.\n\nMy goal for now is to at least make a literate server of tolerating individuals that don't necessarily have to be active 24/7 but active enough to participate.\n\nI am fine with some spelling, and grammar errors with an emphasis on \"some\".\n\nPreferably write in paragraphs but I can understand some short responses, especially when there's not much to say, do, or interact with.\n\nLastly, please give me feedback when reviewing some rules and if ever I may be or other members are crossing some lines.\n\nComment below or message me if interested, but my replies might be delayed as the time I'm writing this and by the time I've finished and submitted it is 4 am and I'm about to sleep soon.\n\nAnyways, thanks for reading!",

            "selftext": "Good day all. Hope we are doing well in these troubling times. I'm hoping to find a partner to create a long term rp with, based in the Star Wars universe. I have a couple of ideas in mind which I will briefly summarise here. I will be playing original characters as I personally don't want to risk getting one wrong and I like the idea of building and sculpting a blank canvas, however I'm happy to have my partner play whoever they would like.\n\n(1) Set between episodes 3-4. After the slaughter of the Jedi created by Order 66, it was believed all the Jedi and their younglings were destroyed. However, one youngling managed to slip away undetected. He grew up isolated on a moon, staying undetected by the Emperor's watchful eye. Perhaps your a bounty hunter, a random stranger who stumbles across me. I'll leave that to you.\n\n(2) This can be set in any time. My character is the average smuggler and trader, getting whatever I can get my hands on for a healthy payout of credits at the end of the day. All I care about is money and I'll stop at nothing to get it. Plenty of options for this one for your character. \n\nAny other ideas are. It's then welcome and I'd love to hear them if you do. I personally prefer to write in the third person as well. I have good grammar and would appreciate the same back, writing at least one full paragraph a time. Thanks for your time and have a nice day.",

            "selftext": "Hello, you can call me Doe! I'm in my 20s, a student, and a proud cat mom. I write multiple paragraphs/novella style (200-500+ words). I love to write detailed descriptions and delve into a character\u2019s head/emotions as well as surroundings. I compare it to writing a novel together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand if the scene doesn\u2019t have alot going on and therefore requires less like rapid fire. I adore having long, thoughtful replies where we truly immerse ourselves in the world. I'm hoping to find a partner whose as enthusiastic and passionate about the plot and writing as I am. When I get invested in a story, it\u2019s 100% dedication. Getting a reply is the highlight of my day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a big fan of romance and using face claims. I\u2019m the type to make pinterest boards, spam you with gifs, headcanons, and send you songs that remind me of our characters and/or ship. I'll get excited if we come up with a great plot idea or if our characters are being cute or going to get into trouble. I live for this kind of stuff honestly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast but not least I only do MxF (with myself in the female role and looking for older male characters). I don\u2019t double, but I\u2019m more than happy to write side characters of either gender to help move the story along. I'd highly prefer female authors writing male characters. **Male authors, please stop contacting me.** I've been burned too many times. If you persist, I'll ignore your message. Sorry!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDesperately Searching For\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- 21+ partners\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- For you to have an excellent grasp of grammar, punctuation, spelling, and capitalization. Both in character and out of character. (Literate to advanced writers only, please. I'm not looking for newbies).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- The more description, the better! I'm looking for someone can write as much as me (2 to 4 paragraphs or more) and really bring the story to life. I lose interest if I'm the only one that's invested/enthusiastic or coming up with plot ideas. Quality writing makes my heart happy, as does world building together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- The use of real life face claims and joining me in the wonderful world of ship/character development isn't a requirement but I'd sure be delighted if we were on the same page in this regard. (I won't use anime faces, only realistic art if you're uncomfortable with real life)\n\n\nIf you've made it this far, thank you! You won't be disappointed in writing with me. I tend to be online daily and while I'd like it if you were too, I understand that real life things comes first. Please let me know if you're going to be inactive, I'm in this for the long term. If you suddenly stop replying ic and ooc, I'll drop the story after 2 weeks to a month.\n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOriginal Genres:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Mafia/Crime\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Post Apocalyptic/Dystopia\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Supernatural/Modern Fantasy\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Southern/Mid-Western/Urban Gothic\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Modern Mythology/Fairytale Retellings\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Sci-fi\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Superpowers/Gifted\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(As a side note, I *don't* do slice of life plots.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll my characters will be adults and I require my partners to do the same, as there will be adult themes in my writing. **For more plot and genre ideas, message me** ^^  I can write over email or discord, and if we click I'd be happy to give out that info.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease be detailed when you message me, let me know why you chose to contact me. Seeing only \"hey do you wanna rp?\" is a guaranteed way to turn me off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLook forward to hearing from you!",

Why not RP to pass the time, y\u2019know?\n\nI have a few ideas I\u2019d like to try, but I\u2019d be more than willing to hear any ideas you might have. I\u2019m also totally down to come up with something together, and be ~creative~. \nI tend to stick with fantasy or historical settings and plots, just because that\u2019s what I know the best.\n\nBefore you message me, please;\n1. Be over 18. I\u2019m 20, so the reasoning should be self-explanatory. \n\n2. Don\u2019t be in it only for smut. \n\n3. Write in the 3rd person, and have responses between 2-5 paragraphs. (I\u2019m fine with shorter posts when there\u2019s little detail, like a back-and-forth, but regular posts should be at least 2 paragraphs.)\n\n4. Be able to RP on Discord. I use Reddit DM\u2019s to get details sorted, but I only do actual RP\u2019s over there. \n\n5. Be able to respond to any RP more than once a day. People get busy and that\u2019s totally fine if a break is needed, but the 1-post-every-day RP\u2019s tend to get tedious IMO. \n\nAaaaand that\u2019s about it. DM me and I\u2019ll tell you the ideas I had in mind (or vice versa) and we can go from there.",

Getting the boring stuff out of the way: I'm F, 30s, English is my second language and I'm looking for a partner on Reddit PMs. \n\nThe plot: She had the voice. She had the guitar. What she *didn't* have was the luck. Sure, she could get gigs. Sure, people liked hearing her sing and play. They didn't like paying her, though. Playing for room and board was fun at first, but it got old fast.\n\nSo, she decided she had nothing to lose. Why not try a deal with the Prince of Darkness himself? She wasn't really sure it would work, but she tried. Midnight, crossroads. And the offer of her soul.\n\nAnd he did show up. But he didn't want a soul. He wanted a *heart*. Hers. In exchange for everything she had always wanted - fame, fortune, adoration.\n\nOOC notes: Alright, this is just a starter. I'm interested in writing a romance story between an aspiring singer and the Devil himself. I write clean/fade to lack, and I am looking to write the singer and for my partner to pick up the Devil. We can talk about the details, just drop me a PM!",

If you do send me a Chat Request &gt; PM, replies can be scarce and even not existent. So again, please PM. c:**\n\nHi there! Thanks for taking a look at my advertisement!\n\nMy name's Kyle, I'm 20, English and I'm currently looking for some RP partners to write some cool and original stories! Before I say about what I like to roleplay, allow me to introduce myself and my likes.\n\n\u2022 I'm currently 20, so I'm looking for someone 18+. This is mainly due to the fact that my RPs can NSFW in parts and I just wanna make sure no trouble comes of it.\n\n\u2022 I'm currently only looking for FEMALE RP Partners. I do apologize if this offends anyone of the male/trans community. Its just my personal preference. I'd also ask that you're fairly active too. A couple of posts a day at least.\n\n\u2022 I like a partner who's detailed and experienced. Fine, quickfire posts can be shorter, but I like quality in my posts. I'm not asking for half a novel though. There's such a thing as too little and too much detail. Also, I RP in THIRD person only. Again, just my preference, however, I am more than welcome for you to use third/first at your own desire. I also play OC Characters only as well. I don't find it entertaining to play a Canon Character. I don't mind them appearing as side characters but the main story players will be OC x OC.\n\n\u2022 Finally, I like people who are interested in the same things as myself. Please understand what my RP is being based on. I offer a variety so there's plenty to choose from.\n\nRight! Now I have my expectations out of the way, here are the things I'm looking for RP story wise!\n\n* Destiny : I absolutely love this game. To the point where I am a Lore Nerd as well as a Sherpa. I would love to find someone who would want to delve into the stories behind the game and the hundreds of years of lore prior to the first game beginning. I have my own fleshed out OC with his own backstory and cast of supporting characters and would love to tie in our characters into both lore-based scenarios as well as scenes from the game, whilst still having The Guardian be the main hero.\n\nI hope you all enjoyed what I've produced and I hope that I get some responses fairly soon! Thanks again for taking the time to read my post! See you soon!",
