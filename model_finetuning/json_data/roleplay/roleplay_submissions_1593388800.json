I'm brand new to reddit and don't really know what I'm doing but I'm not sure where people find writing buddies these days so...here we are\n\nI think bullet point summaries are nicer to read than walls of text so here's me in a minute:\n\n* I go by Sinny\n* I'm 28 and have been rping for 15+ years\n* my timezone is PDT\n* I work 40 hours M-F but am working about 80% remote right now, so I expect I can be reasonably active\n* I almost exclusively write male characters who are romantically and sexually interested in other dudes\n* my default style is third person past tense para but I'm flexible\n* pretty chill in general and down for most stuff, don't be afraid to ask!\n\nand now another neat list about what I'm looking for!\n\n* someone 18+ who doesn't mind writing mostly dudes\n* discord rp! ideally I'd like to make us a private server\n* someone who doesn't mind a bit of chatting/plotting ooc...pls enthuse over our characters with me,\n* my fave is a combination of slightly smaller para and SMS style threads. I find it easier to keep things moving\n* it'd be super cool if you're down to play a couple characters at once! doesn't need to be a huge cast though -- I can probably only manage like 2 mains myself\n* I'm specifically looking for something involving organized crime, and I already have a developed character that I'd like to play. the plot/setting is super flexible based on what kind of characters you're interested in writing, though\n* I enjoy themes of action, suspense, drama, and romance. I prefer to throw our characters into neat situations and see what develops naturally, though, as opposed to going in with the expectation that they're going to get together (but I am a pretty shameless shipper tbh)\n* 150% down to play with supernatural characters too!!\n\nthe character I'd like to play is japanese, in his early 20s, and a notoriously sadistic debt collector affiliated with the local mob. he's rich, bored, and cruel -- typically more interested in picking fights or intimidating/hurting people than actually getting his money back, though he's fiercely loyal to his boss and protective of his own underlings. he's a bit difficult to approach and about as cuddly as a porcupine, but depending on the characters he interacts with and the circumstances surrounding their interactions, he has the potential to be sweet in his own...questionable way.\n\nanyway, since this is turning into a wall of text after all, feel free to hit me up if you're interested! I'm also happy to answer any questions or throw around possible ideas with you to see if we click",

            "selftext": "Hey there! Are you looking for a fantasy medieval romance that includes near limitless designs? You're in luck! I am seeking a partner that is willing to play an OC against my female OC in a fantasy/medieval realm. This realm is unlimited in regards to its whimsical and fantastical details. All races are welcomed and encouraged! If you're interested in a deeply passionate plot, then this is the story for you. The prompt I'm currently thinking of takes place between two very different characters, possibly even from different kingdoms. You will play an OC that stumbles upon a hidden princess. She is fabled to be dead after a staged funeral over 14 years ago, and now lives under the name of the 'Red Witch'. Through their growing relationship, they will face hardships regarding future revolts against her royal blood and the saving of her people, all while we also explore your character's subplot. I particularly enjoy gritty and realistic themes!\n\nI can write in 3rd &amp; 1st person. I only use Discord. Before we write, I ask that you have a written description of your character so that you're prepared for when we brainstorm other plot ideas.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThank you all!",

            "selftext": "Deep in the ruins of Karusa Valley north of Gerudo City, A figure made his way through the shadows into one of the storage rooms in the Yiga base room, the light of a wall mounted torch illuminated his face. His eyes were red like the Yiga clansmen he was up against, though his hair was a sharp silverish-white, done up in a ponytail using a strong piece of black fabric. His forehead had the symbol of the Sheikah embedded into his skin in red like a tattoo with his mouth being covered by his thin white mask. His blue clothing was thin for mobility, mostly fabric with the expection of some padding in various spots.\n\nHe crept around the corner of one of the wooden crates, catching a guard enthralled by a banana, which gave him enough time to sneak up behind the clansmen and strike him, knocking him to the ground. He quickly made it through the maze of boxes and into a small tunnel, aiming to crawl through it into the next room.\n\nAs he jumped out of the small tunnel, he landed in front of his prize. It was a Royal Family heirloom he was sent to secure for them. He was so close to his prize and as he reached for it, a sword swung at him from behind. The Sheikah had to act fast, dodging it and sliding further away from the heirloom, only to see three of the large yiga clansmen and four smaller ones. \n\n\"There's no escape...\" another clansment muttered behind him as the final Yiga was revealed above all them, the elder Yiga. He was hunched over, using a staff to walk with the head of the staff a wooden carving of the Yiga symbol. \"We have been watching you try to infiltrate our base... impressive. You would be a fine addition to the Yiga clan, and we can ensure the dark lord's return!\" The elder called out, the cornered shiekah staring and saying nothing. \"Fine then. You will loose your life with no final words to utter.\" \n\nThe elder snapped his fingers, two of the larger Yiga pulling out a device that was connected to an ancient Shiekah slate that have recently been surfacing. It was wired up to a metal weapon of some kind that was lighting up brightly. As the sheikah noticed what the device was doing, he awaited until a red beam of energy was shot at him before he pulled out his chain, whipping it across the room at the heirloom and pulling it back to him. \"No! Get the artifact!\" The elder yelled as the beam struck the sheikah, causing him to break apart in reality as he screamed in agony whioe the technology and magic combo tore his body asunder along with the heirloom, both dissapearing into thin air... only to resurface somewhere else in the bountiful land of Hyrule.\n\nXXXXXXXX\n\nHello there!\n\nI hope that the title caught your interest to my Legend of Zelda prompt! \n\nThis prompt has a lot of build up but it deals with my new Sheikah Character I've named Oleander, named after the flower. My goal for the RP is to have Oleander and your character strike up an amazing relationship that turns loving and romantic as they search for the remaining Heirloom parts across hyrule. They will definately have some side quests along the way which will be fun as well!\n\nOleander will essentially get teleported with a fragment of the Royal Heirloom he was sent to acquire, though the teleportation was extremely painful, leaving his armor torn and ripped with cuts on his body. He will land either in front or around your character, of which i want to be another one of the native races, like a Zora or a Rito or a hybrid thats part Hylian. This could allow for some fun combat and story dynamics with their unique abilities! \n\nAs for the timeline of where this will be set, i figure it would be set before the events of Breath of the Wild or after it as it lets us explore a static version of Hyrule that we can change on our own!\n\nOur characters would be going through the world, accomplishing some goal that the two of us set up for them, be it the plot line of the games or a plot line exclusive to the RP. Above all, I would like our characters to grow together and create a strong romantic relationship with eachother.\n\nNow here is the good part for me, which is what I would like to hear from you:\n\n1. What about the prompt or my thoughts interests you the most? What are you most excited about?\n\n2. What do you have in mind for your character? [Name, Age, species, personality, etc.)\n\n3. Whats your characters clothing color and style?\n\n4. Ask me a couple questions you would like answered!\n\nI will definately get back to you as soon as i can! I hope this prompt caught your attention and thanks for reading!\n\n- Chris",

Third person is  a must. No one liners.   \n\n\nWhat will the rp be about?   \nEver heard of DnD? Well this rp will be basically a DnD session. We will use online dice system during battles, persuasion and theft (ect) I will build a world both based on Lord of the rings, dragon age and a little skyrim. I will play different characters both male and female that will accompany you on this journey. The plot will be fairly simple. There is a war in the land and your character will lead a sort of rebellion team that wants to find a compromise to the war so that no more innocent people are hurt. My characters all have depth, personal agendas and opinions, you can get to know them, be their friend, enemy or even lover. They all like and dislike different things and each choice you make can have consequences.   \n\n\nHow will it work?   \n I will make rules for us to follow and we use an online dice system.   \n\n\nWhat are the rules for me?\n\n1. you can play any gender you want! my characters are mixed races and genders. All are open for romance but it can require effort from your part.\n2. 18 plus only\n\nWhat themes and emotions can I expect?   \nexpect drama, love, sadness, violence, heartstrings pulling content, war, battles \n\nWhat I require  \n1. third person writing  \n2. Have discord  \n3. Can reply 5 times a week minimum unless something happens   \n4. No ghosting   \n5. 18 plus   \n\n\nPm me if interested!",

Minimum should be at least a few lines, don't give me like one or two sentences. I'm cool with up to a couple long paragraphs, but nothing crazy please like pages of stuff, it feels like too much happens and there's too little interaction with really long messages. I'd most prefer someone willing to GM at least lightly, taking on more of worldly reactions and characters (not necessarily multiple at once, but various over the course of time, enemies I fight and all). But that's not necessary, and I'm happy to talk more details out!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs my title states, I want a good fantasy and adventure roleplay, with magic, dragons, mythical creatures and fantastical races/monsters, all that jazz. Either romance or staying platonic is fine with me. Ideally, the RP would be neither purely light fluff nor 100% grim seriousness; I like a bit of both.  I have some vague ideas in my head that I couldn't really write out as a whole plot, we'd have to discuss because there's a slew of little ideas I've got that I could jam together as we tweak and see what we'd both like.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLike my title says, I roleplay on Discord, so message me if you're interested, ideally with some info about you/your roleplaying!",

She sat down, leaving a seat as a buffer between the stranger already there and her. \n\nIf the stranger were to look over at the pub\u2019s new patron, they\u2019d see a woman in her mid twenties. Butterscotch locks fell in waves to the midpoint of her back. Blue eyes held specks of green that were dashed and divided like stars in the night sky. They were sharp and unforgiving, even when her face said otherwise. Her cheek bones were high, her jaw bones defined and shaping the area just below full, rose colored lips. The rest of her features were small, afterthoughts to place on a face exquisitely framed. Her nose was small, the tip slightly pointed optimistically upward.\n\n\u201cA gin and tonic, please?\u201d The woman ran her hand through her hair as the bartender began working on the drink in front of her. Her voice was soft, a posh British accent shining through. \n\nAnd yet, it would be her secret to keep that she *wasn\u2019t* at all British. Her secret that she\u2019d been \u201creleased\u201d from a Russian prison two years prior, and her secret that she was a very, very dangerous assassin. \n\nHi, I\u2019m hoping to find someone descriptive and literate to write this RP with me. I usually do 4-6 paragraph length responses and I\u2019m looking for a similar response length from my partner (preferably someone who writes more rather than less). I leave who your character is to your discretion\u2014 I enjoy writing much better when I don\u2019t know what twists or turns my partner may have. Although, I would prefer, as the title suggests, a sort of cat and mouse dynamic between the characters. This can be back and forth, or a \u2018cat and cat\u2019 dynamic perhaps. Obvious suggestions for characters would include an investigator searching for this ghost killer, which turns out to be her, or an assassin for another country with a hit placed on her. \n\nSend me a message if you\u2019re interested!",

I'm Morgan (19) and I have came on here today to look for some long-term partners to spesifically do a roleplay within a couple of fandoms that I enjoy, along with some non-fandom genres I would like to explore if that is not your cup of tea. Though, I will now line out what I require from my partner before I outline what I would like to do;\n\n- Firstly, it's important that you are *atleast* 18+ since I would like to incorperate romance into the story; even if we weren't the condition would still stand. (Not all romance and those themes though I want a story too.) \n- Secondly, I am looking for someone that has experience with roleplaying and writing and someone that can be literate. I don't have a spesific ammount of word-count or length of writing that I prefer just as long as it's well written and my partner has some experience with long-form writing if not roleplaying. \n- Thirdly, I would prefer someone who has time to post around 2-10 times a day I understand if you may have other things going on but I find it hard to keep interest if someone only can post 1-2 times every two days for example. \n\nThese are the Fandoms I would like to explore; \n- Apex Legends/Titanfall (I would love if anyone could play a good Mirage) \n- Overwatch \n- PJO/THOO\n- Marvel/DC (Spider-man would be wanted here too.) \n- Harry Potter \n\nFor these Fandoms I would prefer to be playing a OC but there are a few characters in different Fandoms that I wouldn't mind being if asked or if I am aware of them and that can be discussed once we start talking. \n\nI will also mention something important; PLEASE when you message me put as much information in that message as possible-.. this will be things such as how much experience you have, any ideas you may have for the plot and the characters you would like to play.  (and dont use the chat request system/direct message just send me a traditional message because it will mean I will be able to answer you easier.) Doing this will mean that I will be more likely to answer you.",

Without being too prescriptive, I thought it might be interesting to propose a general outline and further develop it with a writing partner who is open to contributing ideas of their own.\n\nThe basics:\n\n- Takes place in Ancient Rome. Some time between 31 BC \u2014 AD 476.\n- Arranged marriage. Characters must be a minimum of 18 years of age. No exceptions. I have some ideas for background.\n- Historically accurate. Though I\u2019m flexible on the fidelity of accuracy. Historical events will anchor certain aspects.\n- Mature and potentially dark themes may arise.\n- Conflict and contrasting values between characters.\n\nPreferences:\n\n- 3rd person, past tense.\n- Adv. Literate only.\n- Writing sample is not necessary. I can tell after an initial discussion whether or not it will be a good match.\n- 21+ years old minimum. Exceptions are rarely made but not out of the question. Hard \u201cNO\u201d on anyone under the age of 18 (applies to both OOC and IC, no exceptions)\n- Comfortable with story-supporting adult themes. Consent is key for writers, even if it isn\u2019t for our characters.\n- Willingness to learn and dig for information. You need not be a historian.\n- Multi-para to novella (flex, quality &amp;amp;gt; length)\n- Discord or Google Docs.\n- Active, collaborative, communicative, transparent.  \n- Minimum 1 reply a day or every other day. (Life is busy, I\u2019m flexible and willing to work with just about any schedule, so long as we set expectations early)\n- Timezone irrelevant. I am on the West Coast of the US (PDT).\n\nIf you\u2019re interested, send me a chat or direct message. Please write \u201cStardust\u201d in your subject line or somewhere in your message body.

My character would be a 20yo girl, and yours should be at least 30.\n\nMy character is Jessica, a 5'2 ginger girl. Her hair is curly and short, reaching her shoulders. Her skin is pale white, with freckles on her nose and cheeks. Emelie is shy and introspective. Through highschool and most of her life, she distanced herself from possible friendships and even relationships, afraid of letting people hurt her.\n\nJessica is insecure with her looks, and specially her height, but she's trying to get better, visiting s therapist every week and getting hold of her life. She feels the need of proving herself worthy, after growing up in a poor family with four brothers.\n\nShe moved from her parents house and reted an apartment she could barely pay for, with a waitress salary. Wanting to at least save some money for college, she decided to look for a roommate to pay for the second bedroom.\n\nDM me if you're interested :)",

When it comes to writing, I stick to 3rd person and paragraphs. I've been role-playing for about 6 years and I use different platforms but right now I'm looking to write on Discord!  I'm comfortable with mature content and smut, and I expect you to be as well. Please be 18+, I won't write with anyone underage. I'm usually able to reply at least once a day but real life can get busy sometimes.\n\nRight now, I'm looking for a romance-based roleplay. I'm not a fan of writing 'goody two-shoes' male characters or gary stues so my OCs tend to be assholes, cold, or on the 'darker' side lol. But I'll interact with any female characters personality-wise! As for the plot, I usually prefer it when the couple isn't together at the start since I enjoy a build-up, and I love some angst! I can do modern or fantasy, we can discuss plot ideas better later :)\n\nShoot me a message here on Reddit if interested, and thank you for reading this!",

            "selftext": "Welcome to the land of Itri, a massive continent ruled by 1 massive kingdom! Yovana,an overall peaceful kingdom on the surface with a well developed infrastructure. Its society is separated bewteen the upper class, and the working class. In Yovana are a number of guilds.The Armaments guilds spearheads the invention of various forms of weapons,structures and even some forms of transportation. It's Sentinel guild which breeds strong and ruthless warriors. Its Magi Guild which focuses on the many aspects and properties of magic and even alchemy. Yovana has a wide and diverse range of species and races that makes up its population. From orcs,to eleves to even Demi humans,there are many of interesting characters to be met in each kingdom. Some parts of the land are rich and lush with many forests littered throughout while others can be baren and unforgiving depending on where you're going. Many abandoned crypts and caves hold secrets of the land of old. Beasts and creatures alike also roam the lands both friendly and dangerous. In these lands are also different factions and villages. You may find a village of orcs or a cave of cultists worshipping a fallen god who may or may not be sealed away in the land. This story starts off in Yovana. Your character comes into a tavern seeking work and finds that an old man is in need of a pair of adventurers. He starts to explain that his wife has been taken by a cult of necromancers. When he expresses that two people are needed for the mission,a man got up and began to approach you both wanting to join.\n\nThis is a long term RP with action/adventure and slice of life elements. There will also be +18 elements. Romance is dependent on the chemistry between characters. I do plan on having multiple plot points and chapters for the rp to keep it ongoing. \n\nThere are no line requirements but please be creative and descriptive when roleplaying especially when it comes to the action. You may be any species you want for the roleplay and may even create multiple OCs. If your OC is some kind of god or diety then let me know and we will discuss it. All i ask is that you do NOT control my characters or ghost me. If you want leave the roleplay then please let me know and we can end it amicably. Ive been roleplaying for 7 years,write in the 3rd person and I can do 1 paragraph minimum.\n\nIf you're interested then please DM me. Hope to hear from you soon!",

            "selftext": "Greetings. My name is Claire but I prefer to go by Misty online. I am currently **19 years of age** and live in the **US EST time zone.** I have been roleplaying for just over 7 years (almost 8). I prefer to roleplay on **Discord** as it allows me to check in more often and it is easier for me to organize.\n\nI tend to write anywhere from **2-6 paragraphs** but can write more on occasion, though I do tend to stick to that range. Unfortunately, replies could be slow at times due to motivation and scheduling conflicts but I will always try my best to let you know when I will be away. I can make characters specifically for an RP, but more prep time would be needed in advance.\n\nI prefer to write **male characters** as they are easier for me to portray, but do have a couple of female characters I could use. As for ships, I am currently looking for **MXM** and/or **MXF** pairings. I'm currently not interested in FXF pairings. NSFW content ***MUST*** be discussed beforehand as I am still very new to writing it. No matter what happens, I would like the ship (*should there be one*) to be a **slow-burn**.\n\n**Currently I am only looking for FANDOM RPs or particular Original RPs. I don't mind whether this is with Canon characters or OCs.**\n\n**Ground Rules and Expectations**\n\n1. **Be 18+ in age (Characters must also be 18+)**\n2. At least **2 detailed paragraphs** per reply.\n3. Decent grammar is a must. I understand that typos are a thing, but please use proper capitalization and punctuation in your responses.\n4. **3rd Person POV**\n5. Please be open to OOC conversation and chatter.\n6. I am looking for a **long term RP partner**, preferably for **multiple RPs**. They don\u2019t have to be with the same characters or the same world, so long as we are having fun.\n7. I **will not** do plots that are exclusively ERP. I would like to have a story that goes along with any NSFW content and I will not RP just straight up smut.\n8. When contacting me, please state your favorite written work so I know you read through the rules.\n\n**Genres**  \nThe following are a list of genres that I thoroughly enjoy. Those that are bolded are ones I am especially looking for at the current moment. Please note that these favorites can be changed around and just because something isn\u2019t bolded doesn\u2019t mean I am completely against RPing said genre.\n\n* Medieval\n* Fantasy\n* **Angst**\n* Drama\n* **Romance**\n* Slice of Life\n* **Fandom** (see below)\n\n**Fandoms**  \nAt the current time, Fandom RPs are preferred to Original RPs. Below is a list of fandoms I would like to RP, the characters I would like to play, and the ships I prefer for each. Keep in mind that my fandom tastes do shift and may not always be constant. Furthermore, please feel free to come forth with other fandom ideas if you are curious.\n\n**Please note that those with two dots (\u2022\u2022) are fandoms I am especially looking for at the moment and the asterisk (\\*) is by characters I really wish to play.**  \n\n\n* **DC (Animated and Cinematic Universe) \u2022\u2022**  \n\n   * Bruce Wayne  (Batman) \\*\n   * Clark Kent (Superman) \\*\n   * Richard Grayson (Nightwing) \\*\n   * Koriand\u2019r (Starfire)\n   * Lois Lane\n   * Steve Trevor\n   * OCs\n      * Ships: **Clark Kent x Lois Lane**, Bruce Wayne x Diana, Bruce Wayne x Catwoman, **Clark Kent x Bruce Wayne**, Diana x Steve Trevor, **Koriand\u2019r x Richard Grayson**, OC x OC  \n\n* **Kingsmen \u2022\u2022**\n   * \u201cEggsy\u201d Gary Unwin (Galahad / Kingsman) \\*\n   * Whiskey  (Statesman)\n   * Tequila (Statesman)\n   * OCs \\*\n      * Ships: Eggsy Unwin x Harry Hart, **OC x OC**  \n\n* **Marvel (Animated and Cinematic Universe)**  \n\n   * Tony Stark (Iron Man) \\*\n   * Clint Barton (Hawkeye) \\*\n   * Steve Rogers (Captain America) \\*\n   * Bucky Barnes (The Winter Soldier / The White Wolf)\n   * Peter Quill (Star-Lord) \\*\n   * Thor (God of Thunder)  \n\n      * Ships: Tony x Pepper, **Tony x Steve**, Steve x Bucky, **Thor x Star-Lord**, **Clint x Natasha**  \n\n* Other **minor plots** (with no specific plans thus far) I am currently interested in outside of fandoms would be the following:\n   * Company CEO / Employee\n   * Gentleman Spies *(Think Kingsmen or Man From Uncle)*\n   * Cop / Crimelord\n\n**Conclusion**  \nSo while this wasn\u2019t a quick rundown of my preferences, I hope you made it to the end. And if you did, congratulations! If you are interested in any of the fandoms or genres listed in my advert, feel free to hit my DMs to see if we click. From there, we can work out what we wish to RP and any other details we might need.\n\n If you would like an RP sample, feel free to ask for one via DMs. Hope to hear from you soon.",

Is it just a vibe? Is it the Illuminati?.. Who knows, that's a mystery to solve.\nAnd the town has a few curious minds who might find out.\n\nthere's Omar , a quick and clever 19 year old who works at his father's car repair shop, one day he finds himself working on a car with very odd dents and some quite discreet traces of blood. \nThen there's Jake, a laid back funny 20 year old working as the shopkeeper for his uncle's bookstore, he spends most of his time drawing and smoking weed, his favorite hobby was smoking on the bookstores roof late at night, that until he witnessed some disturbing event in one of this nights. Finally there's Gabe, an 18 year old boy who dropped out of college after only one semester, too hyperactive to actually focus effectively on anything, his brain if full of unnecessary informations and conspiracy theories. Other than that there's Jessie the missing girl who used to go to high-school with all of them, there's also Mr. Tailor, a high-school teacher with weird vibes and many more. \n\nI play in third person, I have a few ideas of what to include and how to go about the plot but if you're not going to contribute to the story I think it'd be better to\u00a0 skip on this one, mature themes are to be expected, romance but only if it happens organically, same for smut but only if you want (and if you're good at it, if not we could just do fade-to-black).

            "selftext": "\n\n\n\nI am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+\n\nRecently I have been really into watching supernatural beings movie. I've just finished watching Van Helsing and Dracula 2000. I would like to come up with a story together whether it's we hunt immortals, vampire and human, werewolf and human, or even vampire and werewolf. You may suggest any other creatures you'd like to play but that's just an idea.\n\nI don't want this story to be smut focus, this will be story driven and focus on the plot. I am a very detailed person and I at least write a paragraph or longer. Please don't send one liners as it won't be interesting to roleplay. I mainly roleplay in third but if you are first person then we can do first person.\n\nHere is an idea of how I write: (please do not steal!)\n\n\"Trevor?\" A soft voice called, a women with long dark brown hair and bright blue eyes started down the hallway of the Belmont manor. Her worry eyes travels around until she heard voices. Her eyebrows furrowed in confusion as she stopped at a large door to which she recognized leads to the ball room. She pressed her hands to the double doors and opened them as they lightly creaked in need for a bit of oil.\n\n\"Tre-\" she began but stopped as her eyes widens in fright at the horrid scene before her. \n\nHer hands flew to her mouth as an unknown man with jet black, a bit pass the shoulders hair,  had pierced a cross like weapon, with the longer side inside the chest of her husband. Her voice shook out as a hand immediately flew to her six month pregnant belly of her first child. She took small steps back as Trevor turned his head, looking at his wife with blood spilling from his lips.\n\n\"Ru..n..\" he surprisingly spoke out as if it was his last words. \n\nEvelyn took no chance as she sprinted down the hall, almost tripping over her dress. Her eyes held panic in them as they darted around for somewhere to hide, spotting the room her and Trevor spend most of their time in: the family room. She looked around, deciding to hide in the closet, behind a bunch of coats. She sat down and pressed her hands against her lips to keep herself quiet. Distant footsteps began to approach until they became louder and louder towards the room she was in. Her eyes stared through the small cracks of the closet door just as she saw a figure step in causing her to move back a bit more. Her body shook in fear as one arm was around her swollen stomach. The figure stopped in front of the door until the doors slowly opened revealing the person but to Evelyn's surprise. It was the butler of the house hold. \n\nA shaky sigh escapes her lips as she stood and embraced him. \n\n\"Why are you hiding lady Evelyn?\" He asked in confusion.\n\nElise still held onto him as she cried out \"T..there was a man. He killed Trevor\" she hiccup \"we have to leave\" she pleaded. \n\nBut the butler didn't move as he held a firm grip on Evelyn's wrist. This caused her eyebrows to furrowed as she looked at the butler until another set of footsteps appeared at the door.\n\n\"You've found her. Good\" the voice was husky with an ancient accent. \n\nShe looked to see that it was the same man that killed Trevor as she couldn't help but to notice his blood red eyes staring back at her. His red eyes looked at the butler \n\n\"Thank you. You may leave\" he ordered as the butler did what he was told as if he was being compelled.\n\nEvelyn took small steps back just as the man sped in front of her with inhuman speed. Her breath hitched in her throat as her green eyes stared into his. \n\n\"Such beauty\" the man spoke, lifting his hand up to her hair, gently stroking it \"to bad I have to kill you.\"\n\nA gasp of fright escapes Evelyn's lips as she couldn't help but to notice how long and sharp his nails were and as he spoke, his teeth weren't normal. His canines were much longer and sharper than any human. \n\n\"P..please don't hurt me\" she pleaded as a tear slip down her cheek, she held a hand to her stomach. \n\nThe man ignored her pleas as he leaned his head down to her neck, taking a satisfying sniff \"You smell delightful\" he smirked with a chuckle. \n\nBut Elise didn't know what was coming until she felt two sharp pinches on her neck as a painful gasp escapes her lips. Her hands immediately shot to the man's coat, gripping it tightly in her hands. She felt her blood being drained more and more and felt herself getting weak. Her grip slowly began to loosen and her eyes were struggling to stay awake. The man drained her of her blood , dropping her on the ground as a smirk appeared on his bloodied lips. \n\n\"This power. It's so strong\" he whispered feeling so much energy running through his dead veins. \n\nHe looked at the limp women one last time before leaving as his blood red eyes glowed in the darkness of the manor as rain poured down outside. \n\n\"Now I wait until the next doppelg\u00e4nger to be reborn.\" \n\n ~~\n\nThis is a start of a story I am writing and I find it interesting if I could try to make this into a roleplay with someone I can roleplay with long-term, someone that is detailed and doesn\u2019t write just a few sentences and someone who is serious about roleplaying. What I wrote is an idea of how I write. \n\nPlease do not steal. This is my story and for my use only.",

I only rp in 3rd person and play almost exclusively on discord. I have no length requirements and will roughly match you. Life can get busy so I\u2019d prefer to keep a \u2018post whenever\u2019 policy.\n\nMy character will be a young (adult!) idealistic knight in training. Your character can be the typical knight in shining armor eager to share his knowledge, a cynical and jaded knight being forced to take her on by his order, or anything in-between. Be whoever you want. I have no preference!\n\nI\u2019d like to play in your basic generic medieval fantasy world. I\u2019m not all that knowledge with fandoms, but am open to using aspects of them as inspiration for the setting. I\u2019m interested in long term character-driven story with the romance aspect being a slow-burn.\n\nIf interested, send me message or a start a chat so we can talk and possibly exchange discord information. Either works. Thanks for reading!",

I prefer to use Discord over any other platform.\n\nI've lay dormant for a while and I'm finally looking to get back into some RP. Preferably something hot and steamy with a decent bit of romance to go along with it. I have two specific things in mind I'd love to play out, but really I'm up to chat about anything. Regardless! I'll leave my preferences below.\n\nStar Wars: OCxOC roleplay set in the Star Wars universe. I'm not fussy about the time period, or the specific roles. Though I am partial to a story revolving around two Padawans around the end of the Clone Wars. I also enjoy the dynamic between a Jedi on the run up against an ambitious bounty hunter. I enjoy discussing the roles before hand almost as much as I love playing them, so please do reach out!\n\nDemonic Visit: Roleplay involving one party being visited at night by a demon of some kind. I'm leaving this one pretty open as there's a lot of possibilities, all of which are equally exciting.\nPreferences etc can be discussed in DMs, but I try to be as open as possible! Neither of these roles are set in stone, if you have an idea you'd like to bring to me then I'm happy to chat about it. I love fantasy roles and more contemporary settings too, anything goes with me. Hope to hear from someone soon!\n\nHit me up and I'll drop you my discord in DMs.",

A silent war that rumors, secrets, and poisons were the favored weapons.*\n\n*Be it the new monarch's ear or the thorn itself those that vide for power would use whatever means they could to elevate themselves up in higher status.*  \n\\---\n\nHey there! Thank you for checking out this post. So let\u2019s get down to the nitty-gritty! I have the urge for a historical rp. Specifically, I want to do an rp in the 18th century in a setting of the French court. The show Versailles is a large part of why I want to rp this lol. This, however, wouldn\u2019t include real historical people I'd much rather we make up our own characters to fill in that space. I am all for intrigue, drama, action, angst, and romance! This can either be fully set in the real world or could have light fantasy elements but we can discuss that later.\n\nIf that interests you then let me explain what I would like in a partner and how I operate. Firstly I am over 21 so I ask my partner to be as well. Secondly, I am all for doubling playing characters for romance purposes and would like you to be as well that way we both have a romantic interest. I can do both mxm and fxm (sorry I am not very good at fxf)\n\nI role play in the third perspective and can average from one paragraph (mostly if its a heavy dialog piece) to multiple paragraphs. I really try to involve the environment, character\u2019s dialogue, feelings, and inner thoughts in my replies.\n\nIf this seems interesting to you please send me a message and we can talk in more detail.",

English isnt my first language so grammar and spelling mistakes will be made. Even though i try my best to write as polished as possible.  \nSince I am in my early twenties i would prefer a partner who is also 20+ - a 5 year age difference just makes me feel weird.  \nAbout me:\u00a0\n\n*  I love world building and prefer OCs and Own universes we can create together!\u00a0\n* I really like writing dark stories but i dont mind the setup: i can get into anything fantasy, modern, medieval, dystopian scifi, angel/demons etc.\n*  I like writing both male and female characters. Also straight and gay pairings are cool with me.\u00a0\n* I write in third person and would like you to do so too.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n*  I also dont mind NSWF as long as it fits the story and its not too much (If your not into writing that though im totally ok with leaving it out! Also i have trouble with certain themes i dont want to write! We can talk about that in private. Im NOT looking for a rp with only nsfw stuff... character development and story always comes first!)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat i would like from you: \n\n* Creative\n* Likes to also talk about personal stuff/ doesnt mind getting to know each other\n* you write decently long posts (at least two paragraphs) and like to descripe your character in depth\n* you have a divers set of characters who arent all OVP and Mary-sues!\n* your not a creep haha\n* you dont mind (or even better like) writing m/m pairings  \n\n\n  \nSo if your interested please message me. Please write in the message 1. what theme you would be interested in 2. what kind of characters you like and 3. any ideas you have even if vague.   \nIf you dont include at least two of these i will probably not answer you as it is kind of difficult to sort through a lot of messages to pick who to respond too.  \nIm looking forward to hear from you!",

            "selftext": "Hello there! After a bit of a break, I've returned to seek out quality partners that are interested in a long term MHA roleplay that follows the story of Izuku and friends after graduating from U.A. high.\n\nPlease read below carefully as I'll list some key details about what I'm looking for in a partner:\n\n\u2022 18+ in age, please! Dark themes can and will appear in the roleplay.\n\n\u2022If you want to play a canon character you must be caught up to the Manga. If you are not caught up, original characters are more than welcomed to this roleplay! I love original characters and have a few of my own for this RP.\n\n\u2022 Daily/frequent response rate. This is going to be a LONG term roleplay and I'd like my partner and I to be able to progress the story in a meaningful way. Obviously life happens and there are some days responses are impossible. Happens to the best of us.\n\n\u2022 The canon material is very important to me. It's why I'm so passionate about MHA, of course. Because of this, I'd like our roleplay to work off of the canon to create new material for our roleplay! What this means is that there won't be things such as Deku x Bakugo romance included in the story.\n\n\u2022 Due to the above bullet point, spoilers from the manga are bound to happen! I'll try my best not to spoil things left and right and keep spoilers to a minimum.\n\n\u2022 Two paragraph reply, minimum. There'll be some times where there can be an exception to this rule but the standard should be two paragraphs. Want to write more than that? Awesome. I love multiple paragraphs!\n\n\u2022 Passionate. I can't stress this one enough. Even if you don't watch or read My Hero Academia, as long as you're hyped about it and ready to kick some RP butt, we're going to have a great time together.\n\n\u2022 Friendly OOC chatter is always welcomed!\n\n\u2022 This final point is more so me just rambling on about my thoughts with the roleplay. I am very much looking for someone that is extremely dedicated to great story telling for this roleplay. I am extremely passionate about MHA and the universe it takes place in and I absolutely love creating stories within the setting. I just hope that whoever contacts me is pumped to do this roleplay and is in it for a long, fulfilling experience.\n\nI believe that's everything! Shoot me a message and I'll get back to you as soon as possible. Thanks for reading!\n\n((PSA to anyone that used to roleplay with me on Discord: There was a handful of people I roleplayed with that seemingly ghosted me, or I seemingly ghosted them. After some issues with my Discord account that involves buggy servers and messaging, my account's issues have been resolved by Discord staff. Basically, I wasn't receiving messages, and you guys weren't receiving mine. This has happened before but not on such an annoying scale. I'm happy to announce that this has been fixed!))",

If you are under 18 please do not read further.)\n\nGoing back generation my family has been wealthy and only getting wealthier. By the time I was born we had 2 billion, more than anyone should ever have in their lifetime but we had it...completely legitimately of course, not like my family ran a cut throat company that cheated a lot...\n\nWe were so rich my father enjoyed throwing money around whenever he could. Sounds great right? I didn\u2019t even have to ask for what I wanted, I had my own credit card and could just buy it for myself...as long as I was a good heir. Being the only child I was groomed from day 1 to take over the company. I was meek, quiet. I danced to whatever tune was set for me and in return I got love in the form of money and a promise to have it all one day.\n\nMy father wanted me to learn the importance of keeping your connections to a tight, intimate group. A small group of people you could turn to for anything, so all of our house workers were on retainer. They were paid living wages and a little extra for occasionally nice things in order to work for us and only us. \n\nThat included your mom or dad, who used to bring you as a young child to work with them. We used to play until it became inappropriate for me, befriending someone of the working class. Every aspect of my life had to be chosen carefully so no one would look back and find a \u201cfatal\u201d flaw that would ruin my reputation, and you were that flaw. We didn\u2019t see each other for years and though we were young I held the memory deep in my heart because our friendship was real and pure. I only remember vague things about you though, if I ran into you I wouldn\u2019t recognize you. I even forgot that you were the son of my father\u2019s favorite worker.\n\nThen came summertime of 2020. We both graduated high school, but because of recent hard times in your family your graduation was a bit anticlimactic. My father seeing how companies got good PR for helping people in need these days decided to do something nice for your family and invite you all to live with us in our vacation home over the summer. I recommended a college fund but was scolded for questioning his business prowess.\n\nSo, there we were. Living together in a mansion with our families the next few months. My parents decided to further boost their PR they would be seen around the foreign country with yours having fun and left us to \u201cbe boys\u201d and enjoy some autonomy because letting your kids be independent was all the rage these days. Despite coming with both parents we were alone now, two boys from different worlds and classes linked by our parents.\n\nHey there! I\u2019m Veemo and I\u2019m looking for someone to play this out with, ideally a long term partner I can befriend. Nothing more than friendship though.\n\nI left the details of the country and your parents vague because I wanted to allow you to decide which parent works for mine (both can too) and which job they have. I also wanted to collaborate on the country we visit together.\n\nI just have a few simple requirements to make sure both of us can enjoy the role play and I\u2019ll list them now.\n\n1.\tBe able to write at least a paragraph per turn.\n\n2.\tBring a character profile. This includes a short hair, real life face claim, name, age, height, and a bio that\u2019s at least a paragraph long. The profile can of course wait until we\u2019ve settled more details in private.\n\n3.\tIf you don\u2019t like something I\u2019m doing don\u2019t hesitate to tell me. I\u2019d rather have some constructive criticism than have someone ghost me.\n\n4.\tPlease contribute ideas to the plot too, I don\u2019t want to be the only one thinking up ideas.\n\nAnd those are my requirements! That\u2019s all I have to say for now. If you\u2019re interested shoot me a private message and we can move to Discord but I will not play anywhere else, so sorry if that\u2019s a deal breaker for you.",

            "selftext": "Hiya! I am Vi, I am a roleplayer in my early twenties with several years of writing and roleplaying experience. My style is in third person and focuses heavily on detail and immersion. I like keeping things descriptive and flavorful, but do not worry about me adding too much unnecessary fluff. I try to keep my writing clean and clear. I will warn my posts will fluctuate in size based on the situation and characters involved, so I may be breaking the discord character limit in one post describing an area, and in the other having only maybe a paragraph for the purpose of rapid fire dialogue interactions.  This is because I feel better about the quality if I'm not trying to force the size of a posts. I enjoy partners who also work this way, but if you prefer writing minimum a full two paragraphs, I understand and I can work with that! I'm flexible \\^-\\^\n\nSo that's my writing style, as for my genres and characters - I can work with a lot of different things, but if you are looking for *only* romance and/or slice of life/drama roleplays I am sorry but we are not a good match. I enjoy romance, a lot actually, but I hate it to be the focus and I will almost never agree to go into a romance focused roleplay unless the prompt is interesting enough to me. I prefer it to develop between characters naturally if it's going to happen at all. My preferred elements for the world involve things like action - I will gladly write short one-off combat scenes and have a ton of fun -, adventure, mystery, as well as light sci-fi and/or fantasy elements. There will be times I even have light horror themes, emphasis on light though I have a weak stomach and can't do like horror movie graphic gore, and I enjoy keeping my rps out of being oppressively dark. My main rp universe, in which most of my ocs canonically exist together involves both light sci-fi and fantasy elements. I have plenty of different types of characters too, from a science obsessed serial killer to a peppy conspiracy theorist who wants to prove both aliens and supernatural things exist, from a chill alien who is addicted to coffee and just wants to enjoy peace and quiet for once to a very angry demon who is ready to fight e v e r y  t h i n g.\n\nAll I'm really looking for in a roleplay partner is someone who enjoys character driven roleplay and can meld well with what I described above for my style and is willing, as I am, to work things with their partner. I also want them to be 18+ just because I'm more comfortable with that even though I don't often write 18+ stuff unless I am comfortable with my rp partner and everyone's of age of course. So yeah, if you are interested, message me and we can set something up on discord!",

I'll be listing them in order of the ones I want most to least.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Steincraft:\\*\\* I'd be playing Howard and looking for someone to play John. I have a deep theory on what the Howard's ability is, if not a Gift, and maybe in secret Howard revealing, layer by layer, the truth about his identity to John. This pairing is my absolute favourite so please feel free to RP this one with me!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Shin Soukoku\\*\\* (Akutagawa x Atsushi): I'd be willing to play either role in this case. However, as they ARE enemies in canon we're going to have to plan how they meet up without being seen and all that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI might also be open to Soukoku (playing as Dazai) however, I'm not much confident in my ability to play either member.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am also open to AUs with any of the above listed pairings! Just make sure you describe them to me well enough! \n\nMy rules! (Please read, it shows when you don't!)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I ONLY use discord.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Please have at least completed the second season/Guild arc. However I can't promise on being spoiler-free after. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Thus the flair, NSFW is an option but I do NOT want it to be necessarily central to the RP. However, regardless of the content I do not feel comfortable writing with anyone under 18, especially as these are intended to be romantic relationships. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Please don't bug me for replies unless I've been quiet for more than a day. There may also be times where I'm online but just...not in the mood to write. I also have a job. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Three sentences minimum in response, please! But please don't feel you have to match my long responses. Para or multi para is fine!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Don't try to get to know me irl.

Unfortunately, I lost my login for my discord so any partners I previously had, please get in touch and we can resume if you\u2019d like. Aside from that, I have some new ideas to run by anyone interested!\n\nI write detailed posts with several paragraphs (not novel length) and would like an advanced writing partner to role play with. Have a good handle on grammar and spelling as well. Please be on the other side of 20 in age too please. I do not make exceptions to this rule.\n\n**Campaign Crafting -**\nSo, I guess the technical term is GM, but I don\u2019t consider myself experienced enough to do that. This idea came to me a month ago from an RP that I was thoroughly enjoying where I essentially made a \u201ccustom campaign\u201d where my partner\u2019s OC was the main character in a DOOM game and my character was essentially their guide and aid MGS-style. I set the pace in which they gathered equipment and the enemy\u2019s they faced but how they handled a situation was up to them. So a lot like a GM but I have a main character that has a heavy hand in helping them and there\u2019s collaboration on the setting and elements of the story. \n\nThese ideas will be split between established media and more original/generic ideas and settings. Please note, ideas based on fandoms will have my personal spin or adjustments. Especially media with open settings or games that can be heavily modified like XCOM or Fallout.\n\nMedia I\u2019d like to try \u2018crafting\u2019 a campaign from:\nDoki Doki Literature Club\nDOOM\nGirls Frontline\nResident Evil\nSCP\nThe Boys\nXCOM\n\nOther: \nCannon Fodder - \nOur characters are NPCs from different video games and suddenly find themselves thrown through different movies and video games. From trying to survive insane players in multiplayer games to running away from serial killers in famous slasher films, our characters must do everything they can to survive and make it back to their respective worlds. \n\nCyberpunk -\nA mix between Cyberpunk 2077 and Ruiner with some other Cyberpunk settings thrown in. This is open for large adjustments and collaborations.\n\nHorror Setting -\nI have a lot of ideas for a horror setting, a lot of them more supernatural than slasher. Ask about them if you\u2019re interested in that!\n\nMagical Mecha-\nMy M/Cs spirit is magically bound to a mech and is looking to regain her physical human body. Y/C finds her new form and becomes the mech\u2019s new pilot. Very interested in trying this one.",

I'm looking for a sorta dark/supernatural roleplay.  \nWhat I ask of you  \n\u2022At least three paragraphs or more! I write about five each including about eight sentences or more. Add your own creativity to your response! Not just reacting and that\u2019s that.  \n\u2022I prefer dark themes in a way so I would prefer if your character is harsh, cruel. Self-centered and egotistical in a way! But of course plot development and all changes that. I just don\u2019t like flat out fluff and happiness. I just feel like there is no..conflict between the two.  \n\u2022I ask that you have proper grammar.  \n\u2022I write in third person so I would prefer you as well do that!\n\nHere is some idea for my list. I have many plots for most of these pairings and if you are interested in the pairing then hit me up and I\u2019ll tell you! Most of these aren't really romance to be honest. But if you want it we can do that!  \n*Fallen angel x demon*  \n*Human x nonhuman*  \n*Human x blood lust vampire*  \n*Good girl x bad boy*  \n*A high school or college plot where monsters are hiding in secrecy and they catch their attention on a particular female.*  \n*A vampire takes an interest in a female he finds stumbling around in the pouring rain mumbling numbers.*\n\nThat's what I'm into lately, if you have an idea that is sorta along these lines then do tell me! I am willing to listen!  \nSee ya!",

            "selftext": "Hi, fellow writing enthusiasts of [r/roleplay](https://www.reddit.com/r/roleplay/)! I've found a couple of excellent partners for this particular idea, but I've recently found the bandwidth for a couple more, so I figured I'd float this concept back out there to see if I can find another prospective storytelling friend or two!\n\nIf you couldn't tell by the onomatopoeic nature of my username, I'm kind of a sucker for superhero stories. And I'm looking for the right few storytelling partners who might be up for finding the cross-section of the splashy flash of the superheroic and the charming slice-of-life escapades found on a college campus! While maybe seemingly disparate genres, I have an idea for a setting that weaves those elements together in a whimsical, playful manner. I'll detail the basics here, and gladly share more about my character if you find yourself interested in the sandbox scenario I've set up.\n\n&gt;Fletcher Fallon has always been a dork. Growing up, he'd sneak a flashlight under his covers so he could read comic books until the early hours of morning. Of course, Fletcher doesn't (and hasn't ever) exactly fit the mold of a superhero; he's more gawky, athletic but not a jock. And that's without mentioning his lack of powers, which you think might stop him from being super, but doesn't keep him from trying his best to be a hero. What started as a goofy Halloween costume his senior year of high school, with some modifications and fairly low-tech gadgets, turned into a superhero ensemble he brought with him to his college dorm. (Despite his university being a prestigious one, he'd heard stories about crime in his adopted college town.) The first time Fletcher unretires his jet-black superhero ensemble as a freshman (during his first few weeks on campus, no less) is to successfully prevent a break-in at the campus bookstore; reluctantly, his efforts make the front page of the school newspaper, christening the unlikely hero as \"The Shade.\" His newly-earned fame doesn't change anything when he's still in his civilian clothes, trying to make it through his first semester of classes, but unknowingly to him, the press has drawn the attention of at least one supervillainess. Maybe she's a resident of his bustling dorm building; maybe she sits behind him in his philosophy lecture.\n\nIn broad strokes, that's the framework for the story I'm looking to tell! Half-lighthearted adventure romp while Fletcher is wearing his superhero suit, half-slice-of-life goodness while he's his civilian self. (And a romance could certainly bloom between Fletcher and a supervillainess counterpart! It would be fun to explore that shifting dynamic between the two.) Ideally, I'm hoping to find someone willing to play a supervillainess, and if you're feeling particularly verbose, maybe even a few! (Fletcher having to grapple with a small sorority of supervillainesses would be so much fun.) And just because Fletcher fights crime without powers doesn't mean your character/s have to go without special abilities! Imaginative powers are welcome and encouraged.\n\nWhile hand-to-hand combat will no doubt ensue, I'm hoping for a breezy, bloodless story here. (Mischief would mostly be the name of the game in terms of supervillainy. I'm not looking for a villainess who wants to off Fletcher outright, but more of a Saturday morning cartoon vibe where she tries to cutely embarrass poor Fletch at every turn.) While stakes will certainly be high for our characters, I'm not looking for anything where death is part of a villainess' grand plans. I'm in my 20s, and prospective writing partners should be as well (or older). Effort and detail are more important to me than how often you're able to write when it comes to responses, and I'd be happy writing either through Discord or Reddit messages! Please include an idea for your supervillainess' name in the subject line of a PM so I know you've read this far. (Or in a chat request; that works too!) If you can come up with a brief character description like I wrote for Fletcher, along with any specific powers you'd like to imbue your villainess with, that would be amazing. I hope to see some little orange envelopes arrive faster than a speeding bullet!",

            "selftext": "The kind of story I'd like to create with you is not your ordinary story. It is an extraordinary story. It is a philosophical, psychological, spiritual, thrilling story. A story packed with adventure, with diabolical fantasy, with glass-breaking action, and murderous mystery. It is a story that explores Pandemonium, a story that travels through the magical world of King Arthur, a story that descends into the heart of darkness, a story of death and destruction dealing with the profoundest questions of life.\n\nCommunication is key, and I reply reasonably often unless something were to come up. I write multi-paragraph responses that go past Discord's character limit at times. All I ask is that you give things your all and have all the fun you want.\n\nHere is the plot summary of what I have in mind:\n\n&gt; A miraculous island had emerged from the sea without rhyme or reason. The island was so strange that all the world's governments had announced a unilateral quarantine so that scientists could study this vast island, free of tourist interference. No one was allowed in, and the navy had set up a blockade to keep any sightseers away.\n\n&gt; The mysterious island spawned more conspiracy theories than anything in the history of civilization. The most common conspiracy was that the island was where the Illuminati would build their New World Order and take over the world. The New Age industry went into overdrive, saying how that the island was alive, breathing like Gaia, the mother of Earth, and that everyone had a duty to become One with this undefined entity. Among others, rumor had it that the island was the famous kingdom of King Arthur. Some claimed it was Hyperborea, the paradise of the Greek mythos where the sun never set. The island captured the zeitgeist of the times and the name Atlantis stuck, the long-lost island that sunk exactly in the same place where this mysterious island appeared.\n\n&gt; Whatever the truth was, one fact remained certain: it was a home for a mysterious killer who became known as the Mistletoe Madman. It was claimed that the same sacred plant, the mistletoe, was being used by this killer who slayed the government's researchers. With each grotesque murder, a mistletoe sprig was left behind, as a macabre marking of the killer's monstrous modus operandi. The maniac was said to be hiding on the island, harnessing its magical powers to destroy the world. And it's up to a top intel agent and her two pals to lead a search and rescue team to stop him.\n\nIt's time to begin the show. To raise the curtains and make a performance worth seeing. The spotlight's on you. Are you ready to shine?",

Our families got very close and when parents moved away I had established myself here so I stayed.  I\u2019ve got a son that I still bring by to see your parents off and they love babysitting or taking him to lunch.  Your boyfriend thinks that you have a thing for me, and that I want to get into your pants. \n\n*Sports League*\nWe meet playing in a long adult co ed basketball or softball league.  We could be on the same tram or competing teams.  You could be a regular or just filling in for a friend.  And our main initial convos can take place at the game or the bar afterwards where everyone goes.\n\n*The Beach*\nYou\u2019re at the beach with some friends when you see a little boy that looks familiar.  Upon second glance you realize it\u2019s your older sister\u2019s friend\u2019s son.  You decide to come over and say hi to him, and introduce yourself to me. (Also open to playing this out at the mall, bowling, or a carnival/county fair.)\n\n*Football on Sunday*\nI\u2019m at the sports bar with a few friends watching the games.  My 5 year old son is with us and he\u2019s got all his gear on too eating his chicken tenders and fries.  You\u2019re there with some friends? Rooting for the same teams as us or maybe the opposite?\n\n* Alumni*\nMy son\u2019s mother is the alum of the university you go to.  You\u2019re volunteering to work an alumni event or reunion and we meet there when she asks me to come along so as not to look like the \u201csingle mom\u201d that she is in front of her old college classmates.\n\n\n*Pumpkin Picking*\nYou and your college roommate/friend are in full basic white girl mode with your leggings and uggs taking selfies at the pumpkin patch.  Having some fun, I send him over to try and pick up a pumpkin that\u2019s clearly way to heavy for him and watch the humor that ensues.  Me and you (and your friend?) start talking and decide t hang out.\n\n*Daycare/Pre School*\nYou can be a teacher? Another parent? Perhaps an older sister that sometimes picks up and/or drops off?\n\n\nMessage me on here and we can chat about some plot points before moving to discord!",

            "selftext": "Hello all, I'm relatively new to the role-playing. Growing up I was fascinated by Lord of the Rings and other olden time RPG type stories and I was hoping to re-create something like that as far as the world goes. The plots can be ranging from romance, to action, to mystery, or any mix of what we can come up with. NSFW aspects are welcome, but I\u2019m trying not to focus on that. I would like it to be for a longer RP so story lines can develop, and characters can grow so the action might not come right away. I\u2019m not a stickler about where we go with the story and I won\u2019t get all bent out of shape like some people do when you don\u2019t adhere to their exact style or the direction they want to go in. Just a chill laid back RP that we both can enjoy and be proud of.\n\nAs for the writing style I usually write anywhere between 200-500 words at a time in the 3rd person, but you can write in whatever style you\u2019d prefer. I\u2019m not going to say I\u2019m the greatest when it comes to grammar, formatting, or even writing, but I try my best, so please try too. We don\u2019t have to be too frequent, maybe once or twice a week or more if we\u2019re really into it. OOC conversations are very much welcome as we can brainstorm ideas to develop characters and bounce ideas off each other. Below are some of the titles of example prompts.\n\nElven Emissary\n\nKnight x Princess\n\nPrincess Captured by Rebels\n\nPrincess running away from arranged marriage\n\nSeeking Necromancer\n\nFeel free to Message if you're interested.

I\u2019m looking for action! Romance! And of course, adventure! I have a few prompts in mind but if you have anything you\u2019d like to try, please free to share. Some ideas I had in mind were as follows, a group of women from different walks of life all band together and become a notorious group of outlaws. A hunter seeks a long-lost treasure located somewhere in this area and he\u2019ll do anything to find it. A man goes on the run after being wrongfully accused of a crime he didn\u2019t commit. Obviously, there is more to it than that, but this is just a basic summary.    \n\nI am an experienced role player with almost fifteen years\u2019 experience under my belt so you can count on me to post detailed responses. My posts typically vary between 4-8 paragraphs depending on the scenario. You don\u2019t need a character\u2019s backstory every time they speak after all.

Each of them also share some basic magic as well, such as shapeshifting (often into human form, though i like to keep some hint to their true nature, like eye color, iris shape, etc.) as well as Telepathy.\n\nThere are various Dragons, Drakes and other draconic wyrms and monsters, then there are the Elemental Dragons, there are not many of each element, lore reason why but we can get to that later, there are far more abundant the other monsters such just classical dragons and drakes which are far, far weaker but also much greater in number.\n\nMaybe you're a knight or a dragonslayer or even just a hapless individual thinking that bringing down a great dragon will earn you title and land, the respect of your peers or others. Maybe you're just a farmer and are pissed that a dragon keeps eating your cattle. Maybe it's a case of humans over-working the land, cutting down the forests and cleaning out the pastures so there is not a hunting spot for the dragons for hundreds of kilometers so they are left with no choice in the matter. I am sure we can figure something out.\n\nSend me a PM if any of this interests you and you'd like to flesh this out further.",

This is Beatrice. \nI'm here because i'm looking for someone very literate and detailed, and by that i mean someone that writes at least two or three paragraph per post. I always want to keep up the flake inside the plot, so you have to be detailed. I do write in third person, past tense and also i play both genders. Another thing i love is people who do play multiple characters, that makes the plot even more intresting. \n\nWhat I'm looking for in a plot is for something that has do with slice of life/drama or romantic roleplays with different stories. I also do enjoy family roleplays (nothing sexual) but it could be driven into different directions. \n\nSome of my plots are:\n\n1. Young Parents \n2. Interracial Couple (fight against their families disappointments)\n3. Age Gap Couple (old man vs a young women)\n4. Highschool Lovers \n5. Married Couple facing difficults to have a baby very soon. \n6. Mafia Boyfriend",

            "selftext": "Hello, you can call me Doe! I'm in my 20s, a small business owner, and a proud cat mom. I write multiple paragraphs/novella style (200-500+ words). I love to write detailed descriptions and delve into a character\u2019s head/emotions as well as surroundings. I compare  it to writing a novel together.\n\nI understand if the scene doesn\u2019t have alot going on and therefore requires less like rapid fire. I adore having long, thoughtful replies where we truly immerse  ourselves in the world. I'm hoping to find a partner whose as  enthusiastic and passionate about the  plot and writing as I am. When I get invested in a story, it\u2019s 100% dedication. Getting a reply is the highlight of my day.\n\nI'm a big fan of romance and using face claims. I\u2019m the type to make pinterest  boards, spam you with gifs, headcanons, and send you songs that remind  me of our characters and/or ship. I'll get  excited if  we come up with future plot ideas or if our characters are being  cute or angsty.\n\nLast but not least I only do MxF (with *myself*  in the female role and I'm looking for older male characters). I don\u2019t double, but I\u2019m more than happy to  write side characters of either gender to help move the story along. I'd highly  prefer female authors writing male characters. **Male authors, please stop contacting me.** I've been burned too many times. If you persist, I'll ignore your message. Sorry!\n\nDesperately Searching For\n\n\\- 21+ partners\n\n\\- For you to have an excellent grasp of grammar, punctuation, spelling, and capitalization. Both in character and out of character. (Literate  to advanced writers only, please. I'm not looking for newbies).\n\n\\- The more description, the better! I'm looking for someone can  write as much as me (2 to 4 paragraphs or more) and really bring the story to life. I lose interest if I'm the only one that's invested/enthusiastic or coming up with plot ideas. Quality writing makes my heart happy, as does world building together.\n\n\\-The use of real life face claims and joining me in the wonderful world of ship/character development isn't a requirement but I'd sure be delighted if we were on the same page in this regard. (I won't  use anime faces, only realistic art if you're uncomfortable with real life)\n\nIf you've made it this far, thank you! You won't be disappointed in  writing with me. I tend to be online daily and while I'd  like it if you were too, I understand that real life things comes first. Please let me know if you're  going to be inactive, I'm in this for the long term. If you suddenly stop replying ic and ooc, I'll drop the story after 2  weeks to a month.\n\nOriginal Genres:\n\n\\- Mafia/Crime\n\n\\- Post Apocalyptic/Dystopia\n\n\\- Supernatural/Modern Fantasy\n\n\\- Southern/Mid-Western/Urban Gothic\n\n\\- Sci-fi\n\n\\- Superpowers/Gifted\n\nFandoms: (I don't write canons)\n\n**Star Wars**, X Files, Haven, Fringe, Stranger Things, Heroes, The Wolf Among Us, **Mercy Thompson Series**, True Blood, Marvel, The OA, Disney (personified), His Dark Materials, Beastars, Horizon Zero Dawn, The Last of Us\n\n(As a side note, I *don't* do slice of life plots.)\n\nAll my characters will be adults and I require my partners to do the same, as there will be adult themes in my writing. **For more plot and genre ideas, message me** \\^\\^  I can write over email or discord, and if we click I'd be happy to give out that info.\n\nPlease be detailed when you message me, let me know why you chose to contact  me. Seeing only \"hey do you wanna rp?\" is a guaranteed way to turn me  off.\n\nLook forward to hearing from you!",

            "selftext": "Hi there. I'm Emily.   \nMy goal in life is to be a writer, ideally a novelist, and it has been for a long time. I've chosen to pursue it as a career path. I roleplay because it's fun, obviously, but more than that, I do it to keep my creative skills sharp and to see just how far I can push them. Consequently, I've done a little bit of just about everything: slice of life, medieval, fantasy, horror, science fiction. I generally don't have much interest in playing canon characters from established series. Rather, if I want to use a fandom as material, I prefer to take the world/story and create original characters within it. For instance, rather than playing Daenerys, from Game of Thrones, I might play an original character that would find herself in the same position as Dany, or simply use the universe and make up a new storyline. I don't have a problem with playing established characters as side characters, but for mains, I like to go original.   \nObviously, roleplays can have completely original storylines as well. \n\nI'm into video games and horror, and I see a lot of movies in general, so chances are good we'll be able to find something in which we share an interest. For those who might be interested, here are some fandoms, in no particular order, that I have enough knowledge about to sustain a roleplay of some sort: Dragon Age, Mass Effect, The Last of Us, Red Dead, Bioshock, Fallout (you get it, I like gaming), Harry Potter, Outlander, The Walking Dead, Game of Thrones, Disney, Gravity Falls, Steven Universe...probably a lot of other things that aren't springing to mind right now. I also read books. There's too many things to list. \n\nSex and romance are a part of life, and I like them to be a part of my roleplays. I don't really want to fade to black or cut those elements out, and in that interest, I'd like my prospective partners to be 21+, 25+ is even better. (It's closer to my age.) Please don't message me if you're under 18. \n\nMy ideal is to find a compatible, long-term writing partner. That can mean doing one story for an extended period of time, and it can also mean doing a lot of different stories, throwing out whatever ideas come to mind and seeing if they come to fruition. If you've read this far and are still interested, great! Drop me a message rather than commenting on the post, if you would. I tend to roleplay on Discord, and I have a lot of free time right now thanks to the national crisis, so I can be available for a lot of writing. Hope to hear from you!",

            "selftext": " Without getting wrapped up in endless extrapolation which will invite further need to contextualize what I mean and so forth until this submission ends up being tens of thousands of words long, I'm mostly here today to find a partner who's interested in compelling leading characters with grand ambitions and the intelligence and thoughtfulness to make them a reality.\n\nI'm a novella writer who enjoys emotionally powerful writing and diving into the wants and needs of individuals and how that inspires them to great acts whether they be a bumpkin peasant, a lowly baron, an influential duke or duchess or those of more swaggering authority and stature in the forms of emperors. I hold a fixated, fairly inflexible preference for original medieval settings, am largely looking for someone who's intrigued by the thought of GMing/DMing, and is enraptured by pointedly niche elements related to worldbuilding ranging from the nuances behind the inflation of goods and land to designing famous poetry and the artists behind them.\n\nBehind me is a number of colorful characters I can make use of, as well as a happy interest in creating new OCs altogether to better fit the world they find themselves born into. I'm a fan of using Discord as a means to communicate whilst the writing takes place on another platform which isn't hamstrung by a text limit.\n\nI'd appreciate writing samples from interested parties, and will likely request them if a post history isn't present for me to take a gander over.",

The boarding was annoying, food was okay but not good and the in flight entertainment consisted of semi recent animated movies for all ages.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCaptain John Marshall chuckled at the sight of his co-pilot furiously staring down at the display of his smartphone. Usually he would have said something, but it was the birthday of Pauls nephew and John was the last person to get between the old man and his family. With the experience of a pilot who had done 467 flights John looked at the information presented to him by the board electronics. Everything seemed alright, ETA was in time, weather clear with no expected turbulence. They were flying a slightly altered route today to avoid some kind of military training and he had worried that it would affect the time schedule, but everything turned out to be okay.  \n\"What on earth is an animal crossing?\" Paul muttered, looking somewhat confused at John who laughed out loud.  \n\"Paul you really need to -\" He began and suddenly froze mit sentence when a whole array of warn lights lit up in front of him.  \n\"What the...\" He hard Paul gasp, just a moment before the plane started falling apart...\n\n\\---\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd with that a new RP begins.\n\nYou were a passenger on the plane and wake up on a beach a few hours later.\n\nWhat happened? Why did it happen? And most important: How to escape?\n\nThe RP will be a wild mix between finding answers to these questions, surviving the island and escaping.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs this influenced by lost? Somewhat but I haven't seen much of lost since I disliked their attitude of never answering any question.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInformation:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlatform: Discord\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAge Requirement: 18+ for player and character\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy timezone: GMT+2 (This is just an information, you don't have to match it)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYour character is completely up to you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will play as the GM, meaning while you control your character I will act as the world and the other people and creatures in it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHey I noticed that all the numbers are primes!: Good job!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope you have an awesome time and stay healthy.",

The character is heavily inspired from [**this**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xye-NhQc6PI) song (the video is so bad so just read the lyrics in the description if you want to hear it. it's also on spotify). I\u2019m hoping to base a roleplay around the general vibe of the song/lyrics.  \n\n\nIn other words, an ancient femme fatale vampiress with an unyielding thirst for blood and mischief. The setting I have in mind for this is a sort of dark urban fantasy (neon retro vibes, maybe?) where monsters and humans mingle without the latter necessarily knowing (but monster hunters, anyone?). I'm hoping to immerse myself with a partner in a gritty world where crimes and horrors aren't an uncommon occurrence.  \n\n\n**2**. I am looking to pair this character with another Type-A personality. A man (mortal or otherwise) with a backbone and an ability to command a room with his presence. I am open to discussing scenes, pairings, histories, and eny element that makes for a collaborative, unique roleplay.  \n\n\n**3.** I enjoy detail and descriptions in my roleplays. Anything more than two paragraphs tends to be my bare minimum, with some of my posts reaching well over the 1000 words. \u2018Course, this is all dependent on what\u2019s going on in the scene, but less than two paragraphs is usually not enough to keep my interest. I understand if that turns some people away. Hopefully there are no hard feelings.  \n\n**4.** My character, depending on the media you prefer to use for character appearances, will look like [**this**](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5a07e93adda50491fd59f9e7b2fd1aa5/tumblr_ozatx6IVKf1ryxgdpo1_1280.jpg) or [**this**](https://cdn-img-o.facciabuco.com/267/8lr5nar71w-notte-vaccata_a.jpg).  \n\n\n**5.** I typically reply a few times a week depending on the length of the replies.  \n\n\n**6.** This can be extremely dark or extremely light-hearted. I swing both ways.  \n\n\n**7.** Also open to being GM'ed in a world and getting up to no good.  \n\n**8.** I need my partner to be at least 18 years old. I'm 23 if that's important for some people. \n\n\n\\- - - -  \n\n\n**Potential Pairings** \n\n. Vampiress x Monster Hunter (mortal or otherwise)  \n. Vampiress x Werewolf  \n. Vampiress x Demon  \n. Vampiress x Shapeshifter  \n. Vampiress x Warlock  \n. Vampiress x Djinn  \n. Vampiress x Newly turned vampire  \n^(( . Anything but a regular human with no knowledge of the supernatural, really ))  \n\n\n**Potential Themes**\n\n. Past lovers  \n. Ancient enemies  \n. Violence/Gore  \n. Grudges  \n. Seduction  \n. Soulmates  \n. Reincarnation  \n. Summonings  \n. One night stands  \n. Cults  \n.

As the title says I'm looking for a long-term roleplay partner for a fantasy, sci-fi, or most anything else story.\n\n* I'd like that you can write more than 4-5 sentences at a time with good spelling.\n* Let me know if you'll be disappearing for a long time.\n* Open in communication so we are having as much fun as possible.\n* Not afraid of adult content, and am open to it being a secondary focus.\n\nMy preferred platform is Discord, though I'd be open to others if you ask first. With all that business out of the way, here's a little about me. I'm an advanced roleplayer who loves fantasy and sci-fi. When I say fantasy, I usually mean your mediaeval fair with more complicated settings instead of typical kingdoms and such. On the other hand, when I say sci-fi I mean far future/space-age type settings the modern era just gets overdone. Though if you do want something a bit more standard, I'm open to ideas. I'm also a big fan of adult content in my stories, but I don't want it to be the sole focus of the roleplay.\n\nIf you want to do something ero, just let me know. I'm open to those kinds of roleplays as well!\n\nIf you have any more questions for me, don't be afraid to ask. My DMs are always open and I'll make sure to answer within a day. To make sure you read this far, tell me your favourite book/movie. I can't wait for your response! Oh, and please send an actual PM instead of Reddit Chat.",
