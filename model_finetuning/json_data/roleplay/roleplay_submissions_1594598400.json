Some prodigies grow up and use their power to help (Heroes), while others use it to harm (Villains). Some of them, though, just want to live their lives as normal citizens.\n\nYou were born of prodigy descent, meaning both your mother and father possessed some sort of ability. Your mother was a hero who fell in love with a villain, resulting in the birth of you. Before you were born, your father was locked away for his crimes and your mother fell out of her profession to raise you.\n\nEvery year in the middle of July, the council of your state holds the trials, in which the state\u2019s prodigies may enter in hopes of landing a job as a professional hero. Each year you dreamed of going, but this year it finally becomes a reality. Now 18, you\u2019re allowed to participate in the trials and hopefully earn a spot in the job your mother once proudly withheld.\n\nI hope you liked my prompt! I can play as male or female, and I\u2019ll gladly roleplay with anyone who messages me regardless of what gender you are or what gender you\u2019re playing as.

This will be an RP with a heavy emphasis on character relations and world-building with a somewhat hard technological system. The following is a very watered-down basic premise: \n\nThe Milky Way galaxy has been colonized. Interplanetary trade is now the centerpiece of civilization. Various planets, inhabited for their resources, export the resources they have in order to import the resources they don't. The Mazona Trade Company, is, therefore, the centerpiece of civilization- as the company with the best ships, they conduct trade across the galaxy more efficiently then anyone else. Competition is often... discouraged, through more unsavory methods.   \n\n\nPirates, those with unlicensed ships, roam the galaxy as secondary couriers of goods and services. The Mazona trade company makes use of mercenaries, temporary hired soldiers, in order to handle these pirates and eliminate the threat to interstellar stability.   \n\n\nThese mercenaries are you. \n\nIf you're interested in such a premise, send me a PM with your Discord ID!  I'll shoot you a message and we can chat.",

The second is my character has a bounty on them as they live in a spot where some Nobel (or just a rich jerk) wants the land and you decide to take it thinking this creature is truly a threat. Or finally you simply just find the monster interesting and decide to stick around and befriend them. \n\nIf you have any ideas of your own I encourage telling me as I'm always looking for new plots to keep it interesting. And if romance is your thing then 18+ and it has to have a good amount of build-up. I also prefer a good amount of detail so a minimum of 2-3 lines depending on what's happening. Gay or straight romance is welcomed and if you really want I'm willing to play female if that's what you prefer and the plot is good. \n\nFeel free to send me a message or comment!",

            "selftext": "Hello Reddit! \n\nI\u2019ve needed a distraction lately with everything going on and this is a plot I\u2019ve wanted to do for a long long time! \n\nFirst off, I am a 23 year old female in the US. I would like to play a female opposite of a male but your real gender doesn\u2019t matter to me. I am also up for doubling. I typically write 3-5 paragraphs per post and would ask for an experienced partner who does the same. \n\nAs for the plot: I would play a young but powerful witch, still learning how to control her powers. Some form of massive danger is upon the world, whether that be demons or vampires or any sort of scary villain. \n\nYour character would be her familiar (Who in this world are pretty strong protectors of witches). He\u2019s come to her for the first time to protect her and help save the world (Quite dramatic I know.) Of course, romantic relationships between witches and familiars are forbidden and who doesn\u2019t love a forbidden romance? \n\nAlso, I am not stuck on you playing a familiar. If you have another character in mind please let me know and we can talk about it!\n\nI prefer messages over chat requests, it works better on my phone! I usually use Discord but can do other platforms as well. Send me a message if you\u2019re interested!",

I currently  have a lot of time on my hands (as a lot of people do) and I miss putting my entire self into a roleplay. \n\nI want to write a slow burn romance (or medium burn) with someone that captures the subtle elements of love and desire. One that appreciates the awkward beginnings, the emotional ups and downs, and one that we can get in to the heads of each character and make it amazing! If a character has complex feelings I want to get into all of that!!\n\nI\u2019m hoping we can brainstorm together, or if you have any ideas you feel you need to itch that you can pitch those. \n\nI\u2019ve just noticed over the years that if I\u2019m not able to joke, talk, get excited about the roleplay and discuss life with my RP partner it just doesn\u2019t have the longevity that we all are looking for. With that in mind, I\u2019m looking for someone who embraces OOC, and understands that  the relationship is integral to the RP. I would like to first become friends and then start the RP if that\u2019s okay.\n\nA little about me: I\u2019m 27, in Seattle, working as a (mental health) therapist, and have some down time in working from home because of the virus. I\u2019m not a gamer, I\u2019ve been trying to learn the piano, my Fitbit and I have a love hate relationship, I\u2019m watching scrubs for the millionth time and still love it, I love reading (philosophy, psychology, fiction) and I love working out and running. I recently went on a week excursion to just hike and refresh myself with nature. I\u2019d love to fill my time with a sweet rp with with you!\n\nI\u2019m looking for someone who has at least a year of roleplay experience, is preferably 21+, appreciates good OOC and can write 3ish paragraphs in each response depending on the context. \n\nSend me a message with a little about you and your discord if you\u2019re interested!\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you :)",

It's important to keep the demons in line. He'll even visit a  few lucky members of society for the big deals or get his kicks twisting a few favors.\n\nAll in a day's work.\n\nHis most recent trip lands him in modern-day. Despite the vast advancements humans made in such a short time, he considers it business as usual. A chance to realign himself with modern-day sin. However, his stint on earth is disrupted when a human accidentally saves the life of a soul that's meant to be his; denying the Devil his due.\n\nThe situation turns sideways when the human holds their own against Lucifer. They provide a unique idea; use the vast network of the internet to complete contracts in record time.\n\nSell your soul in 280 characters or less. The Devil's entering the information age and the human is helping, whether they want to or not.\n\n**DM or chat for details; Discord preferred.**\n\n**Looking for someone willing to world build, I need a good jolt of inspiration for a project.**\n\n**Looking for a male character in Lucifer but female RPers welcome!**\n\n**Multiple characters are a huge plus. In need of someone advanced that understands narrative flow. Quality over quantity but expecting average posts in the 3 paragraph range at the least.**",

            "selftext": "I never expected to post an ad myself, but first time for everything, right? Anyways, I've noticed the lack of RP ads concerning this plot. I'd be excited to do it and would definitely prefer it to be a group RP. Probably 4 people at the most, but I'm also down to narrow it to just one on one if I'm not lucky enough to draw the interest of a couple people. I will still have fun as I'm used to just one on one, considering the majority of group servers I find have 50 people and.. man.. Dude, that's just too much for me.\n\nAnyways, the plot; Kind of important, right? I'm keeping it simple and I'm pretty sure the title is self explanatory. The future of the RP will be discussed throughout the story and by all of us. We'd be roleplaying as the surviving passengers or staff (If you want your character to have been a crew member on the ship), such as captain, cook, cleaning, etc of a terrible accident. Whether or not someone is injured can be seen once the RP begins. But something went wrong, you see. Everything was fine until it wasn't. Were there technical issues? Rough waves.. an unforgiving storm? Did the captain steer us wrong or was something rather.. Interesting in play? Something we couldn't quite explain? Regardless of the how.. We're stuck and as far as we know, we're alone.\n\nPretty straight forward, yeah?\n\nRegarding the kind of partners I'm looking for, again, I'll try to be brief and not so.. Interview like. Honestly, I just want good writers, as we all do. I have nothing against smut, dark content, rough language, or things such as alcohol and smoking. As long as we're having fun and everyone's getting along outside of RP. Speaking of which, we can be buds outside of RP. We can just talk to talk, our interactions don't have to be limited to:\n\n\"Hey. How're you? Good. Down to RP?\"\n\nThey can be if that's what you want, but you know, I'm just tossing that out there. If you're interested, feel free to message me in dms or just comment and I'll reach out to you.\n\n I prefer to RP on Discord and hopefully we can round up a few people!  I'm impressed if you've read this far and applaud your commitment. Also, one last random thing.. I don't know if this matters at all, but I'm a girl. (People ask or think I'm a dude sometimes, so I may as well just put it out there. Doesn't hurt.)",

            "selftext": "Hello, hello!\n\nI am returning to writing after a hiatus brought on by some mental health issues. I'll say right now if you are reading this and you got caught up in that I am sincerely sorry. I am feeling much better now and I am looking for someone to write with. First and foremost I am looking for a skilled and dedicated partner to write with. I love all sorts of characters, especially those that are complicated and flawed. Nobody is perfect, and neither should they be written as so! Besides, imperfections bring about some fun drama.\n\nSo, I will level with you outright- My biggest weakness is coming up with plots. However, that is balanced out by my world-building ability. I love to create a vibrant world that is immersive and real. I've been known to come up with cultures, religions, maps, and all sorts of things. The more real the setting is the more invested I will be!\n\nSo, a bit of info about me:\n\n\u00b7 I'm female, and I prefer to play the female role for my main character. Also, I only do MxF pairings\\~\n\n\u00b7 I am totally okay with a female writing a male partner (and sometimes even prefer it)\n\n\u00b7 I am thirty and would prefer to write with someone closer to my age and experience (I\u2019ve been roleplaying 17 years!)\n\n\u00b7 I live on the East Coast. I tend to be up pretty late. I work full-time and will have some difficulty being around between 8am and 6pm EST, but I'll do my best!\n\n\u00b7 Here is the thing: Quality over quantity, always. That being said, I want to know what your character is thinking, how they are feeling, and how they perceive the world around them. Without details, I will very, very likely lose interest. (sorry, just being honest here)\n\n\u00b7 Short posts are expected during conversation and the like, so don\u2019t sweat the above too much. I don\u2019t really care how long a post is as long as it is immersive.\n\n\u00b7 I prefer GoogleDocs to write posts. I\u2019m good with chatting or OOC in discord or google hangouts. I will not rp on discord. I've tried it and I really just don't enjoy it.\n\nI\u2019ve been desperate for a story that has me engaged and feeling immersed. If you can do that, you\u2019ll have the lion share of all my attention! So I know you read all this ask me how many cats I have when you message me. If you don't, I'll assume you didn't read and I probably won't reply!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSpecific Cravings:\n\nThe Witcher or The Witcher Inspired\n\nComplete original creation world &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3\n\nGame of Thrones INSPIRED (Just don\u2019t want to write during the events of the books/show)\n\nAnything medieval. Worst I can say to your idea is no, which isn\u2019t that bad. So throw your suggestions my way!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I HAVE A PLOT IDEA woooo",

Again, I'll disclose that I'm trans so no one's jimmies will get rustled accidentally.\n\nSo, I have this half-feral vampire oc that I'd like to use in a roleplay, and I recently came up with a plot for it. \nIn it, the vampire (whom I'll give a more detailed description of if you're interested. She'd be a woman around her 20's anyway) would terrorize a small town before getting caught by the government. She'd be placed in a hidden facility to be studied, as vampires aren't much of a thing outside of literature and other media. \n\nThis is where your character would come in. I was thinking they could be a researcher in the facility, tasked to learn as much as they can from the vampire. We can decide the plot onwards from there together. Would they become friends? Maybe your character would try to bust the vampire out of the place? Or perhaps they'd be solely focused on the research? There are a ton of possibilities there, and I'd love to get input from you! Overall though, the rp would be clean. \n\nThe whole thing would be influenced by anime when it comes to its style. Aside from that, I usually write one or two paragraphs per post, and Discord is my preferred platform. Feel free to PM me if you're interested, and put the word 'green' into your post so that I know you read the whole thing. \n\nThank you!",

I get out multiple replies a day, I love OOC chat, and I wanna be friends! I also adore doing art. \n\nMy Fandoms! I don't have too any, but the main fandom I'm looking for as of now is JoJo.

            "selftext": "Hello friends! My name is Sara. I, like many, have way to much time on their hands. So, I'm on the hunt for some new rp partners. A little info about me, I am twenty five years old. I have been role playing for at least half of that time. I love fandoms and slice of life an the ocassional historical fiction and fantasy role plays.\n\nNow when it comes to a partner. I am a little particular. Please be able to write in third person past tense. As well as multi. paragraphs. Now I'm not meaning novel size posts (which I wouldn't mind), but give me something more than just a one liner. I prefer to play female in a Mx F pairing. Having said that, I do not mind doubling so we both get to play both genders. That way we can get the pairing we want and it would be fair. Last thing, please do not god mod and take over playing my character. You play your character and I will play mine.\n\nAnyway! Now that all that negative Nora stuff is out of the way, on to the fun stuff! Like I said, I LOVE Fandoms and slice of Lifes. I also like taking books, shows, movie ideas and just making an AU with all Ocs. Below are some fandoms I like to play. If there is a \\* next to it then I have a plot idea for it. I also put the pairing I am looking for with the character I would love for you to play on bold.\n\n* Teen wolf \\* (**Derek** x OC)\n* Criminal Minds \\* (**Morgan** x OC)\n* Once Upon A Times\\* (**Hook** x OC)\n* Chicago PD / Fire\\* (**Severide** x OC) (**Halstead** x OC)\n* Marvel\\* (**Cap/Steve Rodgers** x OC)\n* Outlander\n* Power Rangers\n\nAs for Slice of life. please have some idea in mind when messaging me. Speaking of which, Any messages that just say \"wanna rp?\" to some degree, will be ignored\n\nAs for my own slice of life idea, my idea is that you would be playing the undercover cop, who is a patron at a bar that is involved in as many illegal things as you can imagine (we can decided specifics later) Your character is to infiltrate and learn as much as possible. My character would be the newest bartender that be friends your character. The two hit it off and what was at first just a fake friendship to get information, turns into something alittle more. \n\nI have more ideas and would love to hash out details if your interested! I am just glossing over it right now. For some more brownie points I would love if you could play a certain face claim for me, maybe build your character around it. However that's not necessary. A girl can dream to rp someone she is fan girling over.",

If none interest you I am more than happy to hear any of your suggestions and do world building with you!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1: The monster under my bed wasn't just a childish imagination. Im an adult now and it finally spoke to me one night. I was frozen and terrified. But it was calm. Weeks passed and I tried to look for it, I only ever caught a glimpse of its eyes as it watched me from the shadows. It grew very protective of me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2.  Everyone in the world has the ability to read minds, except for me. However, I am also the only person who's mind can't be read. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3. Its the 1940s, you're apart of a dangerous Mafia. I am just a bakery owner who has caught your eye. But your fellow Mobs don't want you distracted and are plotting to whack me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4. The sun vanished. There are strange lights in the sky. Almost everyone seems to have vanished. The few people that you run into are different. They are violent and almost puppet like. You think everyone is like that until you run into me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What I'm looking for**\n\n\\-I prefer 21+ but 18+ is alright\n\n\\-Someone who is OK if the stories turn romantic. (BTW this isn't always the case)\n\n\\-Someone who doesn't rush story  \n\n\\-A person who can reply in a timely manner. I understand that life gets in the way but if I don't hear from you within a day or so, I'll consider the RP abandoned\n\n\\-Dm me your favorite color so I know you read through everything\n\n\\-Someone who is creative and wants to build this story. I'm not asking for a novel each reply but I would like more than 3 sentences and a bit of effort to be put into it. I am a person to do 1 liners for dialogue so we aren't having the same conversation for 3 days.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**About me**\n\nI'm 24, Female in the Central time zone. I work 3pm-11pm central almost every single day but I am pretty good about busting out a few paragraphs response on all of my breaks or any chance I can. When at home I typically stay up until 5am and I am able to give my full attention into the current RP.\n\nI have 16 years of roleplay experience, I started very young with D&amp;D I've gone through all forms of roleplay. Text, Voice games (Redm, FiveM, Rust, Ark, Atlas etc) Table tops and even LARPing. Roleplay is a huge passion of mine and Id like to find someone who wants to create fun and engaging stories with me.",

I love slow-burn romance and all the good stuff that goes with it: longing,  pining,  drama,  fluff,  angst,  etc. My posts are generally between 2-6 paragraphs depending on the scene, though I'm not a stickler about length as long as the content is solid and gives me plenty to respond to. I rp in 3ed person past tense, but can be swayed to 1st, and prefer discord for plotting, chatting, and RP. \n\nAs for plots I've had buzzing around my head:\n\nWitch/Demon (Modern)\nViking/Celt Druid (800 AD)\nWarrior/Mage (Fantasy Medieval)\n\nThese are kept vague intentionally,  message me if any of them catch your interest, and if they don't I'd love to hear an idea of yours!",

I typically like to go off of fandoms as that\u2019s easier for me, especially with the maps.\n\nThe plots/settings I am currently interested in are:\n\n* Avatar The Last Airbender (I\u2019m still working on Lok, so I don\u2019t know too much on it so nothing past that show)\n* Skyrim/Medieval fantasy\n* Detroit: Become human\n* Western/RDR\n\nWhat I\u2019m looking for in a partner:\n\n* Please be at least 18.  I\u2019d prefer someone who isn\u2019t too much older than I am.\n* Be able to write at least one good paragraph. You don\u2019t have to write a ton, just one good quality paragraph is fine with me. And have a good grasp with grammar. It doesn\u2019t have to look perfect, but at least know the small stuff like the difference between \u2018your and you\u2019re\u2019. Other than that, small spelling mistakes are okay as I may slip up a few times.\n* Be able to reply at least once a day. Waiting two or more days tends to make interest fade away. I know we all have our own lives, so If you know you\u2019re going to be busy, And I\u2019ll do the same\n* Gender doesn\u2019t matter to me, And your characters could be whatever you want them to be. It doesn\u2019t matter to me.\n* Don\u2019t be in it just for the smut. Don\u2019t make it the main goal, I'm okay with some smut, but there needs to be some chemistry between characters. It can\u2019t just happen without some build up.\n\nA Bit about me:\n\nI am 18, and I live in the EST timezone. I am In between  semi and literate. For my characters, I prefer to play as Oc\u2019s and I am more comfortable with playing females. Although, for brief side characters I can play as male. And for me, a romantic subplot is a must for me. It shouldn\u2019t be the main focus but I definitely still want it in there. As for platforms, I only roleplay on discord. Only because of the servers as it helps me organize things for references and such.\n\nNow, If you read through this, Thank you very much! To make sure you didn\u2019t just skim through, please pm me, starting with your favorite season. Mine is fall. Anyways, Have a good (Day/Morning/Night)!",

Anastasia is en route to meet the man she is due to marry when her ship is attacked. But these pirates seem disinterested in the gold, what are they really after? \n\n- Gold. Robin is a mercenary with nothing to live for when a member of royalty hires her to uncover who is plotting to kill them. But is the threat even real? \n\n- Arranged. As a noble, Bethanys older sibling is engaged to be wed to your character, though our families have never met. When they do meet it becomes very clear to Bethany that they are not a good match. In fact, theres something altogether peculiar about your character...\n\n- Impersonator. The kingdom banished magic folk to the forest for the safety of their people but now magic folk are disappearing. Your royal character awaits the arrival of a visiting wealthy family from far away. When they arrive they don\u2019t behave as you expected. Are they who they say they are? Or is magic infiltrating the castle? \n\nI\u2019d love slow burn romance and plenty of plot, conflict and drama are essential. \n\nCan\u2019t wait to hear from you!",

Of course, it was often cloudy in King\u2019s Landing, but that day it stretched on and blotted out any possible sunlight from seeping through its thick grey coat.*\n\n*The golden-haired girl\u2019s emeralds flew open when a blast shook her awake. She swiped a hand across her forehead. \u2018Nightmare?\u2019 This had to be a nightmare, because the ship\u2019s floorboard groaned, followed by a raucous thud, and a shout. \u201cFire!\u201d A roaring boom shook the galleon. Hurried footsteps clamored overhead. The quartermaster bellowed command, his voice high pitched and quick, like a rooster with its head on the block.*\n\n*The young Lady\u2019s skin prickled, and fear wrapped around her like a dark cape. Faye threw back the bedclothes and raced for her cabin door. She stumbled into the empty corridor. The ship rocked as she staggered toward the main deck, and braced her hands on the wall to keep herself upright. She pushed the outer door, but it held fast. Leaning her shoulder into it, she shoved. A harsh gale caught it and flung the door open, sending her sprawling onto the deck.*\n\n*Blinking, Faye steadied herself on the rail. Raindrops splashed cold on her soft skin, and her white shift clung to her legs like a flapping sail. Shivering, she pushed the golden hair from her face and peered into the darkness. Her eyes widened in horror, and if it was possible, she lost what little amount of color remained in her face as the display unfolded in slow motion. Ominous black flags depicting golden kraken flapped in the wind...*\n\n**Hello fellow Writers,**\n\nMy name is Freya, I'm a girl in my early 20's, and I have been writing and developing stories for a few years. I\u2019m looking for someone who is detailed and descriptive to create a story with me. :) English is not my primary language, but I consider myself literate, however, I feel that word has been overused here.\n\nI have so many ideas floating around, be it an epic, fantasy adventure hanging above our characters' head, or saving the world. I just can\u2019t get enough of it! \n\n**What I\u2019m looking for now:**\n\n* 21+\n* Only Discord.\n* My style of writing is third-person, past-tense.\n* GoT original world, the plot is flexible *(the sample above is just a short introduction).*\n* I\u2019m searching for a strong, confident, charming, maybe a bit ruthless male character.\n* I love to write detailed descriptions, multiple paragraphs, and delve into a character\u2019s head/emotions, so I\u2019m looking for someone detailed and descriptive*,* but quality over quantity!\n* Looking for someone fun and mature, who is willing to breathe life into the world with passion and really bring the story to life with me. :)\n* My plots will always include romance *(can be dark or lighthearted).* I prefer the slow-burn romantic kinds of plots, with character development.\n\n**Please dm me** instead of comments or chat. :) Hope to hear from you soon!",

I want them to be on holiday in a city, maybe Istanbul, Moscow, Florence, Amsterdam, Brussels etc, I am a big fan of European cities. I want them to both speak English, but they can be from different countries, both however will be spending time there for the next month, on breaks from their 9-5 daily jobs that they have for whatever their own reasons are. I\u2019d love for our characters to be thought out, with their quirks and reasons and backstories, but both are there, in the same city. It will be slow, romantic, and will have sexual scenes down the line, but that\u2019s not the main focus. PM me if you\u2019re interested, with the city you\u2019d like it to be in, and then we can discuss starting. I don\u2019t want us to describe anything until we see it, so character descriptions come as our characters come across them.",

Minimum should be at least a few lines, don't give me like one or two sentences. I'm cool with up to a couple long paragraphs, but nothing crazy please like pages of stuff, it feels like too much happens and there's too little interaction with really long messages. As indicated in the title, I'm mainly looking for someone willing to GM at least lightly - playing more of the world and NPCs/characters and such.\n\nI also really want a good fantasy and adventure roleplay, with magic, dragons, mythical creatures and fantastical races/monsters, all that stuff. And anime themes! Namely, I've lately suddenly started to crave the idea of playing someone that gets sent into a fantasy world, is kinda overpowered, that kinda stuff. I'm also interested in letting the possibility of romance arise, and for that I need FxF, not into other pairings.\n\nLike my title says, I roleplay on Discord. Message me if you're interested, ideally with some info about you/your roleplaying!",

I write my rp\u2019s in third person, past tense in the literate style. My range is anywhere from 1-7 paragraphs but I prefer the 3-5 range. As for characters, I play both males and females and enjoy doubling immensely. I\u2019m perfectly fine with all kinds of ships and all ranges of characters. I am LGBTQ+ friendly. I prefer writing over Discord. \n\nAs for what I want to write, I prefer writing fantasy, supernatural and sci-fi. I am also open for period pieces or modern stories with some spice (like gangs/mafia, crime, secret societies etc...). \n\nI will only write with people and characters that are 18+. I do like to have some adult themes in my roleplays but we can discuss that privately. \n\nThings I\u2019m interested in right now: Pirates, Assassins, medieval fantasy, organized crime, arranged marriages, forbidden love, \n\nI do fandoms as well such as: Riverdale, Harry Potter, LOTR, Avatar The Last Airbender, The Last Kingdom, Star Wars and many more. \n\nContact me here and we can discuss more.",

To start off to that end, I wanna say that I RP in third person, at least semi-lit, and want you to do the same. 1 to 2 or maybe sometimes 3 good paragraphs is preferred, but nothing crazy please like pages of stuff, it feels like too much happens and there's too little interaction with really long messages, but there can be exceptions if there's just a lot to describe. As indicated in the title, I'm looking for someone willing to GM - playing more of the world and my companions/NPCs/characters and such.\n\nWhat I'm looking for is a good fantasy and adventure roleplay, with magic, dragons, mythical creatures and fantastical races/monsters, all that stuff. And anime themes! Namely, I've been craving the idea of playing someone that gets sent into a fantasy world, is kinda overpowered, that kinda stuff. I'm also interested in letting the possibility of romance arise, and for that I need FxF, not into other pairings.\n\nLike my title says, I roleplay on Discord. Message me if you're interested, ideally with some info about you/your roleplaying!",

            "selftext": "So, I had this idea while halfway asleep, which I still am. Apologies for any misspellings.\n\nI suppose this is kinda like, a slasher type of plot? Kinda horror. Basically a woman moved into an old barn a mile off town, discovers a scarecrow on the plot. However, the scarecrow has some sorta curse - if the new owner of the barn destroys or gets rid of it, it seeks to kill them. Possibly cursed by a witch that was chased off her own property or something to mess with people? The scarecrow seems to have emotions, too, possibly even having a soul - though, that doesn't stop it from having bloodlust. The scarecrow is surprised, however, when the new woman doesn't get rid of it, instead treating it as if it were some kind of living creature - which, of course, the scarecrow doesn't become until it is gotten rid of, messed with, or during a full moon. Maybe it begins to learn to have an actual life? Or maybe all it cares about is murdering the teens who happen to get lost in the fields and take out their anger on the innocent scarecrow. Maybe the scarecrow becomes more alive the more human emotions it feels, or maybe the curse is different and it can come alive at night? I dunno. I just wanna write something with a killer scarecrow dude. \n\nI'm a third person, literate writer with plenty of experience under my belt and a knack for replying within like, half an hour when I'm motivated. I can probably draw up a design for the scarecrow n stuff. Also, I wanna talk to and get to know ya, so yea! NSFW tag cause like...probably blood, gore, and spooky things. Hit me up with a PM if ya find yourself interested in playing a killer straw man who somehow falls for a random woman who doesn't even know he's alive.",

            "selftext": "Hello! I am looking for a long-term partner in terms of roleplay. I have a scenario set in mind. I'm looking for someone who can match my writing length; typically novella length as I like to write though my post length varies (could be two paragraphs or over 1k words, it's all on context). I am looking someone who is literate to adv. literate. I don't have perfect grammar, but it just needs to be readable. I enjoy descriptive writing, and I prefer to write in past tense, 3rd person lately. I'm not looking for someone who will be on 24/7, but I also don't want to do one message a day. This will deal with some heavy themes, if you are sensitive to certain topics, you'd probably want to steer clear of this. I am in PST and honestly prefer that my partner be no further from me than EST. My main method of roleplay is through discord ONLY as I can be much more organized. I utilize face claims as well as detailed backgrounds. PM me if you're interested and we can see if things will work and I will fill you in on the plot I have in mind. If you've read this far, give me a random fact you love. Thanks!",

Sometimes failing as the violence continues, sure, but hey, trying to enjoy life wherever you are is a great way. With the schools shut due to safety concerns and lack of funding and serious violence picking up, a bunch of teens left in a wartorn city without anything to do is a bad recipe. Some might become rebels, other's might..well, die. But you, my dear friend, want to follow your hobby, no matter what skill. And that's rock music.\n\nWelcome to \"Heavy Rocking In Damascus\"; an RP which, even during times of turmoil, allows kids to enjoy the dream. To have a band. To bad it's struggling and will probably fail, though.\n\n\\---\n\nHi, sorry for the bad introduction. My name's Lingala. Please message me for more info or talk in the comments. Peace.",

Think violent criminal meets sweet, unassuming citizen and falling in love. \n\nYou must be over 18, please, as there is strong potential for NSFW. \n\nI prefer role playing with someone who can do at least two paragraphs per response. I can range from two paragraphs to wordy, lengthy responses oozing with detail. \n\nThe more angst, and love, the better. I\u2019m a sucker for some heart racing scenarios that pull on my strings. \n\nI\u2019m fairly active, so I\u2019d love to jump right in!

            "selftext": "Lately I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about roleplaying an arranged marriage for one of my characters. I\u2019d like romance to be involved and prefer to fade to black. Discord is my preferred method. I write around 1-3 paragraphs in third person and usually respond within a few days. I like my rp to be character focused. Beyond that, I am open to any themes you might want to add. I do not have any requirements on how much or how often you post.\n\nThe setting: A pseudo-medieval world that may or may not contain fantasy elements. If you\u2019ve got a particular world you\u2019d like to play in, I\u2019d be happy to give it a go as well.\n\nMy character: A noble woman kept under her strict family\u2019s thumb. Stoic and polite on the outside, a dreamer on the inside. She has been forced into an arranged marriage against her will and is resigned to her fate. I am also willing to play side characters!\n\nYour character: Anything that sounds fun and fits the theme! Maybe he\u2019s her husband. He could be another noble or a king looking to secure lands or an heir. Maybe another species wanting to ally with Humans. He could be all for the marriage, indifferent to it, or just as against the idea as she is. Perhaps he\u2019s someone else. Maybe he\u2019s related to her husband or is under his employ. Another noble or a commoner? A knight looking for his courtly love? I like when my partners can really get into their character and can work around whatever you choose.\n\nYou can message me directly or through chat. Please include your character and/or any other ideas you have.\n\nThank you for reading!",

We meet and fall in love, but our relationship becomes difficult because of your character being put in the spotlight because of being with me and my character being busy because of having to go on tours, spend days working on songs, albums, music videos, etc. The second plot is similar to the first, except that your character very much dislikes my character to start (for whatever reason you choose) but your friend or best friend is a big fan of mine, so you still tag along when we meet. I\u2019d like both of these plots to be long term so we can start it off at us meeting and we don\u2019t have to rush into getting into the relationship aspect of it. I prefer lengthy responses, at least one paragraph, though more is always welcome. Personally, I roleplay in the first person but I\u2019ll accept any other point of views as well.

            "selftext": "Hey there! I am looking to carry out a Walking Dead inspired roleplay in an AU setting, I am looking to play as Maggie or Andrea or a possible OC but base it at the start of the Apocalypse. We can have both canon and original elements to our roleplay.\n\nI am a 19-year-old female, currently in the CEST/GMT+2 timezone and I am looking to find a long-term roleplay partner for a roleplay in the Walking Dead universe, I have listed the characters I would play below.\n\n**Here is what I am looking for in a partner:**\n\n* Availability - no, I'm not talking 24/7 around the clock availability, just able to make time to roleplay, I understand it's not a priority, and I don't expect it to be.\n* Commitment - please, do not just ghost me if you aren't enjoying it, please, talk it out with me and we can come up with a compromise.\n* Experience/Competency - I would like someone experienced/knowledgeable enough about what they are roleplaying. I would also like around a paragraph or two per response, maybe, of course, less would be acceptable depending on the context of the post/response.\n* Patience - this ties in with the \"availability\" desire, I will be patient with you, as long as you are in return. I get busy sometimes, and I know that you will too.\n\n**I am looking to roleplay one of the two characters below (in order of who I want to play most):**\n\n* Maggie Greene\n* Andrea\n\n\\+ (Potential OC)\n\nYou can play any character you would like from the TWD universe, whether it be from the TV show, the comics or the telltale games. Please make sure they would mesh well with one of those two characters.\n\nIf you are interested and want to discuss further, feel free to shoot me a PM and we will discuss further there/on discord. I have a few ideas regarding an AU - outside of the TV show/comic events.",

            "selftext": "\u201cSshhit.\u201d The sound of a dead engine refusing to start back up again echoed throughout the dense forest. Nina, still in shock, was only focused on turning the key in the ignition. It wasn\u2019t until her dog Bella licked her again that she realized one side of her face was sticky with a warm liquid. She looked into her rearview mirror and saw a cut on her temple, just below her hairline. The woman\u2019s senses began to return to her then, and she put the pieces together to understand what happened.\n\nShe smashed her old truck into a large tree\u2026 how? She couldn\u2019t recall driving off the road, but what she did remember was feeling exhausted, to the point where she could barely keep her eyes open.\n\n\u201cStupid!\u201d Nina scolded herself as she slammed her fists down on the sides of the steering wheel. She shouldn\u2019t have pushed herself, she knew better, but she didn\u2019t want to pull over and sleep in her truck in the middle of nowhere, and she was too far from the last town to turn back around, so pushing forward had felt like the only choice. She nearly made it, too. Last she checked she was no more than six miles away from her destination.\u00a0\n\nNina searched for her phone, almost in a panic. It felt like her last connection to civilization, to safety. Her cut seemed to be the worst of her injuries, and even then it wasn\u2019t so deep that she was gushing blood. Still, it would need to be stitched up, and what really had her worried was getting lost in the vast mountain forest.\u00a0\n\nThe woman sighed in relief when her hand found that cold piece of technology, and she almost dropped it again in her haste to bring it up to check the screen. \u201cYes!\u201d Her face was illuminated by that bright light that let her know her phone was alive and well\u2026 except for the absence of service bars. \u201cDamnit\u2026\u201d Nina\u2019s heart sank. Her phone was almost useless at this point, so she had no choice but to leave her truck and walk.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Nina nodded after a long pause. \u201cWe got this, right Bella?\u201d\u00a0\n\nBella barked and wagged her tail in response, which gave Nina the push she needed to start moving. She grabbed her satchel and threw a few items into it that she thought would be useful without weighing her down too much, then she grabbed a flashlight from a toolbox behind her seat and switched it on. Finally, she carefully made her way out of the truck and did a quick scan of the wreckage. The truck was in pretty bad shape, but it wasn\u2019t completely totaled.\u00a0\n\nShe cautiously made her way to the back of the vehicle, and was relieved to see clear tire tracks. \u201cThese should lead us back to the road,\u201d Nina nodded at Bella, though the words were mostly meant to calm her own nerves.\u00a0\n\nLuckily, the tracks did in fact lead Nina and Bella back to the road, where she would figure out the direction she had been going, held a scarf against her wound, and began walking.\n\n~\n\nHello reddit role-players! I have a scenario I'm looking to play out with someone who finds the concept just as inspiring as I do. You can consider it an outline, and make as many suggestions as you'd like so we can develop something that'll be fun for the both of us.\n\nMy idea is a plot that includes some romance, mystery, danger, drama, mature content, and the supernatural. I would play a female on the run from her ex and his gang. She's currently moving from town to town, taking just about any job she can get to save up enough to keep moving. You would play a werewolf in hiding who resides just outside of the next mountain town she lands in. They meet and come to an agreement that she can stay with your character until she has enough money to move on. While she's staying with your character and working in town, she starts to hear rumors about the mysterious stranger who welcomed her in, though their secret will be more shocking than anything she could've imagined.\u00a0\n\n\nNow that the general idea is taken care of, here's what I'm looking for in an rp partner.\u00a0\n\n&gt;25+ only please. Nothing against younger role-players, but I'm looking for someone closer to my age.\u00a0\n\n&gt;Not too far off from PST.\n\n&gt;Willing to play multiple characters where needed, but we'll each only main one character.\u00a0\n\n&gt;Comfortable with mature content, such as violence, gore, and smut. I'm not looking for anything too wild and graphic, but would like to leave our options open in order to enhance the story.\n\n&gt;I don't expect a certain post length or schedule from you, as my own will fluctuate as we go along. However, I do want someone who is inspired and invested enough that it clearly shows in your writing.\u00a0\n\n&gt;Please be willing to move over to Discord.\n\n\nWow, what a wall of text, sorry to put your eyes through that. But if you've made it this far, I'd love to hear from you! Even if you think we'd be a good match but are looking to play some other scenario, feel free to reach out, I'm always on the lookout for a quality rp partner. Thanks for your time, all!\u00a0",

As such, we favour detail, description and well-fleshed out characters from people who want to experience a pivotal point in the Star Wars universe. Moderated by a growing team of Game Masters, this server hopes to facilitate that experience.\n\nStarting Four Thousand Years before the Battle of Yavin, the story kicks off in the build up to the Great Sith War, with the chaos around the Onderonian Beast Wars, the Mandalorian Crusades, and the growing desire for knowledge and power held by some Jedi. The server hopes to follow the story, and influence it with our own characters. In the spirit of a commitment to the narrative, we hope the story will continue on past this, into the period of relative peace that followed only to be shattered by the Mandalorian Wars and the Jedi Civil War, and beyond.\n\nIf that sounds like it is the atmosphere for you, join the server and say hello! We'll welcome anyone, especially those wanting to dip their toes into a more long form RP.\n```\n\nhttps://discord.gg/VVMzFBg",

An OC masculine vampire trope to play against a human female OC. I write 1x1 with multiple partners at the same time and currently have room/inclination for more. \n\n**Romance angle required** Just so no one misses that detail. \n\n- 3rd Person/Past Tense\n- You play the male OC romantic lead\n- Longterm\n- Multi-para, novella, and beyond. No snippets, one liners, and since when was two paragraphs advanced??? Non. We shall once more into the breach with pens raised and ink wells brimming. Efforts towards proper spelling, grammar, depth of description. I\u2019m greedy. \n- Email, GoogleDocs, Discord are all options. \n- Be 21+ for action, violence, drama, continue ratings description here. Let\u2019s just settle on this isn\u2019t going to be PG. \n- Able to post at least once a day most days. \n- Romance! It\u2019s gotta be there. Set it against a fiery backdrop filled with demons if you like, but make it happen. \n- Partnering is ideal. Equal devotion to planning, plotting, and execution to keep it fiery. Not opposed to working with a GM if that\u2019s your thing, just be clear up front. I am not (however) interested in being the GM for someone else. \n\nMany many possible plots and iterations here. Historical, modern, mish mash. Something more slice of life, or amped up danger and intrigue. Wild West Vampires? Perhaps a\nRoman soldier cut off from his legion? Southern gothic? Or a thoroughly modern mogul with a dark secret? Soul mates separated by time...the options are fairly endless. \n\nSome disclaimers, caveats, exceptions, whatever you\u2019d like to call them:\n\n- No teenage vampires. Ick. Full men please.\n- Details of vampiredom can be tweaked and discussed so that it suits both of us. \n- Vampires don\u2019t sparkle. Period. End of story. Please include the part where it says \u2018Vampires don\u2019t sparkle\u2019 as part of your message so that I know you read all the way through.\n\nSo (this part is super important), message me with something more than hi. Give me some things you\u2019re into to work with and we\u2019ll see if anything sticks. \n\nTruly, I\u2019m open to more than vampires. Got something -with romance- you\u2019ve been itching to play? Let\u2019s hear it. I\u2019m always open to fancy writing partners.\n\nIf you reached out before and didn\u2019t get an answer, feel free to try again. These searches tend to get a little swamped.",

Ideally you would be playing a male character, but I\u2019m not firm on it. I do not want this to be sexual in any way whatsoever. This is non-negotiable. I will not do NSFW of any sort. I\u2019m just looking for someone in my age range (I\u2019m 20) to ensure that it\u2019s a bit more comfortable. I\u2019m in EST, so ideally I\u2019m looking for someone who can roleplay with me between 10am-1am EST. I won\u2019t be awake any earlier/later than that.\n\nI\u2019m semi-literate to literate, and tend to match my replies based on the scene at the time. I just ask that it isn\u2019t exclusively a couple sentences always. I get that things are hectic with COVID, but I am looking for someone who would be active a decent portion of the time. I use Discord, just for the ease of servers. \n\nCurrently, I\u2019m looking for someone willing to roleplay either Doctor Who (a sci-fi show) or something similar to the movie Palm Springs (a time loop movie). However, I\u2019m open to other plot lines! Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Dystopian, Medieval/Renaissance, Horror\u2014 I\u2019m open to just about anything as long as it\u2019s good! \n\nI\u2019d like to be friends outside of the roleplay, too!

I'll save the introductions for your message and let's get straight to the point--\n\nI want a Persona 5 RP where the overall idea is somewhat inspired by the Persona game what with the Metaverse and Palaces.\n\nI really just want a Persona style RP where I am not a GM and can play a part much like Joker's, the Main Character in a world of people to interact with or things to do. How in depth things are is up to you, as the GM!\n\nAs for what I 'require,' it's not much. I wont say you need to go for 10 lines every reply because to me that sounds crazy (what do you even say to expand all those lines? Just makes things confusing.) and as long as you are a friendly person and type enough to help the story along, thats great! Ill use 1st person myself and I am a straight guy. (Don't be afraid to put male characters as other Persona Users and Arcanas!)\n\nIm not really sure what more to add! Im looking forward to your messages! I hope to meet some great friends so lets hope we can be!",

            "selftext": "Ivory had always been a mild mannered boy. His friends joked that if he was mugged he'd ask how the mugger was doing, how his family was and how his day could be improved. Little did he know a spiked drink was about to change his whole life. \n\nHe always went to a small coffee shop early in the morning before his first college classes started. He knew one of the baristas there, Vivian. They'd been friends since they were kids, she normally hated men to the core due to some childhood trauma that he'd been through with her. Vivian didn't hate him, due to that, she was far more lenient with him than any other man. Of course, this didn't stop the comments \"I hate when you men do that.\", \"You men\u2026\" seemed to be one of her go tos. It bothered Ivory, but he valued their friendship so he never said much. \n\nOne day Vivien made a comment that threw him off. \"Y'know. I've always thought you'd be so much better if you were just a girl.\" He gave her a look that said, 'what do you mean?' as he took a sip of the coffee she'd made him. She preferred when he didn't talk so he eventually learned to speak in facial expressions. \"You're calm and you listen, most of the time, but you're no pushover either. I remember the time you stood up to my father for what he did\u2026\" She said looking down, that familiar anger filling her face again as she revisited a time in her life that she liked to pretend never happened. \"He...threatened you and...he followed through too...There's a big scar on your back to prove it. Without you that nightmare never would've ended.\" She said softly. She barely ever spoke that way. \n\nIvory chuckled. \"Not true. You're a smart girl. You would've gotten yourself out eventually.\" He said matter-of-factly. Vivien just rolled her eyes \"Maybe so, but you're missing the point. I could have gotten myself out, but at that time in my life you were there for me. Even if I had it would've taken time. The fact is, I know you were scared to do it. It had been going on for so long, I thought no one cared. Even though you always listened, you never did anything, I didn't even think you cared till you...Sorry, I was in a bad place\u2026\" She started to trail off.\n\nIvory just listened as he sipped at his coffee. Once she'd stopped he put the cup down. \"I don't blame you. I knew something had to change. I had told people too. No one believed me either. 'Jeff wouldn't do that. Jeff's a great guy.' No one would listen.\" He parroted what they'd say, she hit the countertop as he did, not angry at him, but at the memories that flooded her mind. \"I know...that's why I...you put yourself in harm's way just to prove to everyone else that Jeff was who we said he was. That's why I said what I did.\" She sighed. Ivory wanted to just say, 'take me as a case study for why not all men are awful human beings. How you're generalizing half the human population to be evil because of a traumatic experience.' but he knew it'd just upset her so he simply shrugged. \"Maybe.\" After that he sipped the last of his brew. Something had tasted off about it, but he couldn't really put his finger on it. He hadn't really been focused on the coffee either with the conversation that had just taken place. \n\nIvory stood up. \"Well, I s'pose that's my coffee for today.\" He said grabbing his bookbag out of the adjacent seat. \"I suppose it is.\" She returned. \"See you tomorrow?\" She asked, which was odd to him; he was here everyday, of course he would be here tomorrow as well. He brushed it off as nothing though. \"Yeah, I gotta get to class. See ya!\" He said before darting out the door of the campus coffee shop and to the science building, trying to make sure he would be there on time.\n\nHe would make it and the rest of his day would be normal for the most part. He would eventually make it back to his single person dorm room, still drained from his workout even after the shower. He slipped into his fluffy, baggy pajamas and let sleep overtake him. Around the middle of the night he woke up and felt strange. His body felt different, lighter? He couldn't quite put a finger on anything. He got up out of bed and stepped in front of the mirror. Immediately he let out a surprised gasp. His body wasn't him anymore it was her. He looked vaguely like himself, but just female. \n\nIvory stared at herself in the mirror, confused. Her hair was longer, her body was slimmer, her hips wider. He let out a small chuckle, looking over her shoulder at her back and thighs. 'I mean...at least I'm attractive?' She thought to herself as thoughts flooded her mind. 'Now all my IDs and documents are incorrect.', 'how will I convince people I'm still me?', 'This has got to be a dream right?' She was still wearing the same pajamas. Maybe she could just go out on a walk, clear her head? That's what she decided to do.\n\nShe, without changing at all, stepped outside her dorm and began walking down the hall to the elevator, riding it up to the ground floor. She walked past the guy working the desk out into the brisk night. She kept walking until she saw something strange. There was a bird, mid-flight, just stuck midair. She walked toward it and stared at it, bewildered. \"This is really lucid for a dream, but there's no way this is real.\" She said, sighing with relief, afterward giggling about how her voice sounded. She had been afraid to talk at first, but knowing it was a dream was like a blanket of comfort wrapped around her. \n\nShe wondered how much she could do in the dream world. She wondered how much power she had here. In theory, she should be able to do anything right? She closed her eyes for a moment and envisioned being a guy again. When she opened her eyes however, nothing had changed. 'Okay, so not absolute power.' She thought to herself. She closed her eyes again, wondering if she could teleport herself somewhere amazing. A mind palace? A mountain range? A mayan ruin? Anywhere cool, but she suddenly felt an intense heat to her right before an intense burning. When she opened her eyes she was midair, but still at campus. \n\nShe looked and saw she was about to hit a building, she immediately tensed up holding up her arms to protect herself. She smashed through one wall and out the other side, landing on the street on the other side. \"W-What the\u2026\" She groaned in pain, slowly pulling herself to her feet on the other side of the building. \"Found you, Anima!\" Yelled out a voice from above, cutting her off. Ivory looked up to see a woman in some fancy clothes standing at the top of a building. She formed a ball of energy at her fingertip and it shot out. Ivory had just enough time to dodge out of the way of this one. It smashed into the ground behind her and released an intense explosion that threw her forward. She managed to catch her footing this time, though. \"What are you doing!?\" Ivory called out. He tried to envision her exploding herself, this was her dream after all, but nothing happened. \n\n\"Don't play dumb, Rubrum Anima!\" She said before ten of those same balls of energy appeared around her. They shot in rapid succession. Ivory dodged as well as she could but they moved too fast, as she tensed up, preparing for the blast, though, it hurt a lot less. She was leaned forward, the blast seemed to flow around her and barely pushed her back at all this time. \"Show me what you've got!\" She yelled, effortlessly shooting more of those tiny explosive balls. When she last tensed up, Ivory noticed that she seemed to have a lot more energy like that. She flexed her leg muscles and felt power growing from within. She tried to aim at the woman, arms in front of her face to protect her from the blasts. Upon release she shot forward like a bullet, leaving the pavement behind her obliterated into a small crater. She barreled through the explosions hitting her, though they did slow her down they didn't feel nearly as painful as before. Her objective was to grab the woman, but she miscalculated her timing, a little too slow she opened her arms up from the guard position as quick as possible in order to grab onto her but instead wound up cutting through the woman's midsection with her bare hands. It was like butter, she didn't intend to. Her eyes went wide as she tried to look behind her. The woman's lower half toppled over, as the top half was flying through the air. She eventually landed on her head and crumpled to the ground lifeless. \n\nIvory stuck her legs out. The lost momentum from the explosions meant she could possibly land on the roof. She just barely managed to stay on the edge, waving her arms comically in an attempt not to fall. She was able to gain her bearings and turn around. She put her hand over her mouth as she looked at the corpse, blood spilling out still. She fell to her knees, heaving a few times before last night's dinner spewed out all over the roof. The woman had changed, after she died she turned into someone Ivory had seen before. No one she knew well, but she'd seen her around campus. She'd always wished she'd had the balls to ask her out somewhere but that seemed pretty mute now as her intestines were spilled out. She chastised herself immediately. \"Her guts are spilling out and the first thing you think of is that you'd like to have dated her!? Idiot!\" She struck the roof below her and her hand sunk right through. That's when she remembered. \"Oh thank god...It's of no consequence...it's all a dream.\" She stood up and jumped down from the roof, landing like Iron Man before standing up and jogging back to the room. The only way she could think to wake up was to go back to sleep. So she did.\n\nIvory awoke to birds chirping. Saturday. There weren't any classes today. He jumped up and went straight to the mirror, breathing a sigh of relief. \"Oh thank god\u2026\" He said softly. \"All just a bad dream.\" He said before getting some clothes on and going out for a walk. He looked around when he got outside. There seemed to be a lot of cops around. He went to his regular coffee shop. Vivien greeted him warmly. \"Ivory! I thought you weren't coming. I was worried for a moment, since you're so late.\" She chuckled. \"Typical man. Don't make me worry so much!\" She sounded mad, but she was smiling. \"What's got you so happy, you're not usually like this when you're mad at me?\" He asked with a degree of confusion. She laughed. \"No reason.\" Ivory rolled his eyes. She then leaned in close. \"Did you hear about the murder?\" Ivory looked up, raising an eyebrow. \"They found a student on top of the Reed dorm building, ripped in half no less! The police are confounded. They've no idea how it could've happened. They've found some DNA evidence at the scene though, some barf.\" She said seriously. Ivory's eyes went wide, and he turned around. \"Something wrong, Ivory?\" She asked. \"I-I'm not thirsty\u2026\" He mumbled before leaving the shop. \n\n//*\n\nHeyyo! I'm your friendly neighborhood RP Boi. I'm twenty, bored, and looking for friends with which to story write in a manner that is collaborative. I've had a semester of English Major experience before my crappy semester of Computer Science took my college funding. Now I work at Papa Johns taking people pizza in hopes that they sign my paycheck. Basically what I'm saying is I'm writing Jesus. In all seriousness, I've been collaboratively story writing since I was thirteen and I have at least a little skill. At least I'd like to think so. I'm most likely around literate. Nowhere near advanced lit. I do prefer not to have to do multiple paragraph responses, but I am open to it, and I know I can. I'm always open to constructive criticism as well, so feel free to help me improve.\n\nAs for what I expect: It's gonna be that we use the same format, that you can spell, and that you can use correct grammar and punctuation. I can let post length go, especially since I can't go very long myself. I would prefer if you are able to respond multiple times a day. I have a job as well though, so I definitely understand the limiting factors, just make sure to keep me posted whenever you need to bounce.\n\nWe can discuss all the story details in PMs or on Discord. I would like to mention that your character is going to be a girl, though. I'll answer every message I get regarding this post, but please DM me or send me a thingy, because I'm not gonna mess around with people asking in the comments. Also please fit \"Fiddlesticks, that really ruffles my feathers\" in your message somewhere creatively, both for my amusement and so I know you made it all the way through. Thanks :3",

I would love to do something long-term and usually prefer to play over Reddit PM's but I could be convinced to play on Discord. A few other small things to note before I present my ideas.\n\nI live on the west coast and am on Pacific time. I do work as well various times throughout the day but I will always try my best to respond. I can play Male or Female, and open to MxM, FxF, FxM pairings. \n\nPlease do not message me in chat if you are interested I always forget to check it.\n\nNow onto Fandoms, I'm interested in I have OC's in mind for most of these and would love to share them upon request.\n\nRWBY: I would love to play this starting around season 3 or even at the beginning along with the show, we can go along with the story while making our own changes.\n\nDigimon: For this, I was thinking along the lines of something similar to Adventure 1, or Adventure 2. I could be convinced to do something similar to Tamers but the first two seasons of Digimon are my favorite.\n\nPercy Jackson and the Olympians: I thought this could be set during Heroes of Olympus, or afterward. We could have OC's join the 7 of prophecy or even replace some.\n\nHarry Potter: This could be played in the era of the Golden Trio, or the next generation I'm open to either one I'm not super in love with playing in the Era of the Mauraders, but I could be convinced with a good idea.\n\nDanganronpa: I loved this series and this could go about a few different ways we could make up an original group of students, or borrow some from the previous games. I was really hoping to play through one of the killing games I have tons of ideas for characters.\n\nATLA, or LoK: I love Avatar the Last Airbender, but most of my ideas for this which aren't a whole lot, are set in a world post-Avatar Korra. We could search for the new avatar, fight off all kinds of evil characters and interact with characters from the past.\n\nKingdom hearts: Finally I would love to do this in a world post KH3 where we play new wielders under the training of one of the many keyblade wielders now in the world. We would travel from world to world stopping the heartless in and even the darkness in our own hearts.\n\n-Persona 5: I've been super into P5 and am currently playing P5 Royal. (No spoilers) I have a few ideas involving a group of phantom thieves that become based in America around the same time as the events of the game. I think it could be a lot of fun with the right partner.",

Each character whether they be side are not are completely unique with their own personalities, and backgrounds. How you interact with each of these character determines how much you'll find out about the past of Wonderland, and how secretly twisted land of wonder really is. It also contains really heavy themes, so please be okay with that. \n\nPatty is a 5,10 ft tall, Wonderland freak show that is covered in weirdness from the tip of his top hat down to his rabbit-like Thumper feet! \n\nThis Roleplay will be a Fantasy, and I'd really perfer for your character not to be 2-D and really have some hidden depths to them. I love a good roleplay with tons of amount of character development, plot twists, and overall just a really fun roleplay! \n\nI am very flexible and I am open to all sorts of ideas, Want to add a love triangle into the story? Go for it! Want to have your character be very complicated and a true puzzle piece? I am all for it! I would perfer this roleplay to be over Discord.\n\nPlease PM me if you are interested, I would like my rp buddy to at least be 18+. I'm comfortable with NFSW moments in roleplay just not when the roleplay becomes orriented around NFSW. I'm what some would call literate I guess, my resonses range from 2 paragraphs to maybe 7-8. You don't always have to match me, just give me something to work with. (No one liners, at least a solid paragraph). I'm looking forward to seeing your character(s)!\n\n{SIDE NOTE: I love to share songs that remind me of your or my character! I'd also perfer that you'd be able to describe your outfits or send pictures of them, Thank you! }",

With life and the world as it is I\u2019m looking for more Roleplays so I can have a bit of escape. I live in est time but keep odd hours and my sleep schedule often varies. I can often reply at least once a day though, usually more if our schedules line up and life\u2019s not too busy. \n\nAnyways for my idea. Magic is kind of it\u2019s own underground, functioning just under the surface of society. You would be a kingpin, yourself and your coven a mafia. What exactly your coven had ties in and business dealings with would be up to you. Enter my character, a human witch. Maybe my character can brew a potion that would allow you to walk in the daylight. Maybe I burned a rival and I as for your protection in exchange for my services, etc. \n\nAnyways, if this sounds interesting at all just let me know and send a message. I can\u2019t wait!",

            "selftext": "Hello, hello!\n\nI am returning to writing after a hiatus brought on by some mental health issues. I'll say right now if you are reading this and you got caught up in that I am sincerely sorry. I am feeling much better now and I am looking for someone to write with. First and foremost I am looking for a skilled and dedicated partner. I love all sorts of characters, especially those that are complicated and flawed. Nobody is perfect, and neither should they be written as so! Besides, imperfections bring about some fun drama.\n\nSo, I will level with you outright- My biggest weakness is coming up with plots. However, that is balanced out by my world-building ability. I love to create a vibrant world that is immersive and real. I've been known to come up with cultures, religions, maps, and all sorts of things. The more real the setting is the more invested I will be!\n\nSo, a bit of info about me:\n\n\u00b7 I'm female, and I prefer to play the female role for my main character. Also, I only do MxF pairings\\~\n\n\u00b7 I am totally okay with a female writing a male partner (and sometimes even prefer it)\n\n\u00b7 I am thirty and would prefer to write with someone closer to my age and experience (I\u2019ve been roleplaying 17 years!)\n\n\u00b7 I live on the East Coast. I tend to be up pretty late. I work full-time and will have some difficulty being around between 8am and 6pm EST, but I'll do my best!\n\n\u00b7 Here is the thing: Quality over quantity, always. That being said, I want to know what your character is thinking, how they are feeling, and how they perceive the world around them. Without details, I will very, very likely to lose interest. (sorry, just being honest here)\n\n\u00b7 Short posts are expected during conversation and the like, so don\u2019t sweat the above too much. I don\u2019t really care how long a post is as long as it is immersive.\n\n\u00b7 I prefer GoogleDocs to write posts. I\u2019m good with chatting or OOC in discord or google hangouts. I will not rp on discord. I've tried it and I really just don't enjoy it.\n\nI\u2019ve been desperate for a story that has me engaged and feeling immersed. If you can do that, you\u2019ll have the lion share of all my attention! So I know you read all this ask me how many cats I have when you message me. If you don't, I'll assume you didn't read and I probably won't reply!\n\nSpecific Cravings:\n\nThe Witcher or The Witcher Inspired:\n\nDeadmen: This is an original idea of mine. Years after the Witcher books/show/game, Witchers are no more. They have faded from existence. Now there are Deadmen, so named because their profession usually ends in an early death. They do not have the mutations of Witchers, as such knowledge has been lost, but they fight monsters for bounties and live as Witchers did. After many years the Wild Hunt has returned, looking for a descendant of the Lady of Time and Space. What they want with her, no one is sure. But she is on the run and in hiding. Will this Deadman be able to help save her?\n\nComplete original creation world &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3- I love original plots above all else.\n\nReunited- A couple are betrothed but are torn apart by years of war. When he returns they are both different, changed by years of conflict. Will they learn to love each other? And what will happen when the conflict comes back to their doorstep?\n\nGame of Thrones INSPIRED (Just don\u2019t want to write during the events of the books/show)- \n\nI like coming up with new houses and the like. I also really love doing an arranged marriage. I have a loose plot idea set long before the books, when dragons still exist, for an arranged marriage between a Northerner and a Southron girl. \n\nAnything medieval. Worst I can say to your idea is no, which isn\u2019t that bad. So throw your suggestions my way!",

I'm also interested in letting the possibility of romance arise, and for that I need FxF, not into other pairings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLike my title says, I roleplay on Discord.

            "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nHope you\u2019re having a good day. I\u2019m 24 year old guy, who has spend several years roleplay, looking for a longterm roleplay partner. While I usually do ERP, I really like word building and character development, so I want to focus on these aspects in this roleplay.\n\nIdea for roleplay:You\u2019re holy warrior, a beacon of light and justice, a holy Paladin, who serves her faith with all of her might. A new kingdom has accepted your true faith, at least the nobility, as for the rest of the kingdom, they still believe in there false gods and live their lives according  to the false teaching by their evil and corrupted sorcerers. You are sent to both teach people about the true faith and to deal with any and all evil being you come across. To do this task you have been assigned a priest who has lived in that kingdom for some time now, he will be both your guide and aid in trouble, as he while not being a capable fighter possess strong faith and thus can call for power of true god.\n\nI\u2019m keeping this idea quite open as I\u2019m open to modify it and expend, so I\u2019m open to suggestion and new ideas.\n\nIdea itself could be best described as Medieval Fantasy, with heavy focus on religion, different cultures and good vs evil.\n\nSomething to know about how I roleplay:\n\n* I want both of us to control background characters and do world building/push story forward. While I\u2019m happy doing most of both roleplaying different characters and building the world around I would love if you helped me out and gave your ideas and input into maters.\n* I usually respond 1-3 times a day with a response of 1-3 paragraphs and I aspect similar output out of my character. There is always RealLife things and that is understandable, but with good communication everything can resolved \ud83d\ude0a\n* I\u2019m from Europe, +2 time zone, so have that in mind if you have problem with that.\n* I tend to enjoy creating dark stories, so it\u2019s definitely +18.\n* I can use both reddit messages or discord.\n\nHope to hear from some of you \ud83d\ude0a",

I'm a 23 y/o F in MST+ looking for a long term partner that's not going to waste my time or ghost me when they feel like the role play isn't going in the direction they will it to. I need someone who is willing to communicate OOC and not be afraid to come out and say they are no longer interested or are looking for something different. I get way too many dm's from people who don't take what I offer to the table seriously or too many people who can't communicate their desires or concerns for the narrative that we are writing **TOGETHER**. It's a team effort, come on now. Anyways, if you can do all that, and are 18+, then let's chat.\n\nCurrently I'm on a huge binge of supernatural entities. Like vampires, lycans, ghouls, ghosts, etc. I've been replaying Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines so my inspiration is spilling roughly from that. However, I'm really just craving a narrative, so let's discuss the thousands upon thousands of plots that we can muster up *together.* See how I keep doing that? That's because role plays are meant to be discussed together, not fully written up by one side. I will ignore all dm's that simply say \"Wanna rp?\". I'm really looking for someone with at least a couple years of experience as well, I don't have the patience to walk someone through the basics of role play, I'm sorry :/ I'm also not open to any fandoms at the moment, so for all you Fandom rp'ers out there, sorry! So I know you read this: when dm'ing me, tell me your favorite color (: I hope to hear back from everyone!\n\n\\- Always, Shy",

            "selftext": " (Not sure why this was deemed as \u201cNSFW predominant\u201d when I clearly typed below that I don\u2019t want it to be just smut. But I\u2019ll change some phrasing anyway.)\n\n\\~For the past 127 years, there's been a long running gameshow. Set in the future where almost anything is possible, which means entertainment has gotten pretty extreme and ruthless. The game show is treated like Hunger Games, except more than one person can win. They just have to come of age. Once a month, they draw names from anyone ranging from 13 years old, to 18. They only pick the \"Vagabonds\" though. The ones that really have no purpose in life. It's always even, however. 50 males, and females to create an even 100. So depending on how many males or females die, the following month, names will be drawn from each gender to replace the fallen. Each month, they're thrown into a huge city to play the game. The catch? There's no laws. Any drugs, alcohol, underage drinking and even murder... anything is allowed in the game. Throughout the game show, the viewers can donate players coins when you complete a request sent in... often a request like murder, arson, anything the viewers might enjoy. The game is long running for a reason... the only way to make it out is to live to be 30, in which you can leave the city with a hefty 10 million dollars. No one has ever been able to do it yet.\n\nHe's the fan favorite, the one who has never backed down from a viewer's request. He was 15 when he was selected for the game. ((Characters current age is up to roleplay partner.)) He is rich, sitting on about a quarter million coins. She's the new girl who was just thrown into the game, an 18 year old. Before she can even make it into an apartment/house, she's robbed of her starter coins. As soon as she reaches an apartment, she receives a viewer request on her watch. The viewers are requesting her to go find the fan favorite and rob him of at least 1,000 coins. Her reward? 9,000 coins. However, he finds her trying to steal his coins and quickly captures her. To the viewers surprise, he keeps her around and they begin to develop a friendship, eventually developing into something more as they try to survive the harsh world of The Gameshow.\n\nHi there! I'm an 18-year-old female looking for someone detailed, experienced and literate to play out a long-term, sexual romance storyline with, so please be 18+, not looking for anyone over 24 (Please respect this wish.) I am looking for a consistently responsive partner (Unless busy, of course) to play this through. Please keep it to about a paragraph or possibly more. I wrote the overall summary down in a way that it has heavy plot, so don't rush into any smut, I prefer buildup. Buildup is fun and allows for better character development when the smut does begin. Also please keep in mind that this is a fairly dark and possibly sadistic plot. If you aren't comfortable with any of that, I don't suggest messaging me. I am willing to playthrough the story line either here on Reddit or Discord, which ever one you are comfortable with, please pm me and let me know so we can either stay or move over to discuss character descriptions and more.\n\nAll I ask is that if you don't like something about the plot, please let me know and I will gladly talk with you to see if theres something else we can tweak about the storyline. All I ask, is that if you get bored during the playthrough, please let me know. Do not ghost me. If you decide you want to try something else, stop me and let me know. I will do the same thing as well.\n\n(Only marked as NSFW because of the nature of the plot. Just a reminder however, that the storyline I wrote out is very plot dependent, and isn't smut packed.)",

I imagine a partner for this will be hard to find, but I am here to give it a shot. :)  \n\nPlease be 21+ as there will be NSFW themes. I don\u2019t fade to black.\n\nI have been craving a character driven World of Warcraft themed roleplay -- specifically between a male human and a female blood elf. I have a general plot idea or two for how they meet and such. The main thing I\u2019m interested in is the relationship between the two and their budding forbidden romance between enemies, but I would like to add action and adventure into the story as well. It is Wow, after all, and I love the game. And if you\u2019d like to build an even bigger plot with me, I\u2019m all for it. Also, if you\u2019d like to play a canon character, I am not opposed, and we can definitely discuss it.\n\nWhat I\u2019m looking for in a partner:\n\n* Literate with a good grasp on grammar. \n* Write in 3rd person/past tense in multi paragraph form. 2-5 paragraphs and up depending on what\u2019s happening in the story.\n* Please be descriptive and willing to help move the plot forward.\n* Please be able to convey emotions, thoughts, and reactions your character has to mine, even if it would be considered meta. I would like to know their inner turmoil and such as it pertains to character growth and bond, and I will give you the same. I want to get immersed in the love story and our characters.\n* People who are able to post multiple times a day will be given precedence. \n\nI hope my wants in a partner aren\u2019t too demanding. I\u2019m really an easy going person. I\u2019m just looking for someone who wants to have fun with this and can help me escape stresses of life. \n\nPlease send me a message in my inbox if you\u2019re interested. I\u2019m even open to your own ideas if you have any, so don\u2019t be shy!",

            "selftext": "\nFirstly, thank you for taking the time to read my post... if you\u2019re a fan of the Witcher, then this Roleplay just might be what you\u2019re looking for. I\u2019m currently looking for my partner to play a female character.\nI must add, this RP is set in the video games, NOT the Netflix series; it will take place after the main story, Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine. \nMy preferred length is adv-lit, though I can mostly definitely elevate to novella if my partner shares the same sentiment. I\u2019ve watched all Witcher media, read the books and absolutely adore the games\u2014 I like to consider myself an expert on the lore, but please do not let that frighten you off if you\u2019re more novice in terms of the story &amp; mythos; I\u2019ll gladly teach. \nI shall of course be playing Geralt of Rivia, I have played him half a dozen times before in certain Roleplays, and my partners have praised my convincing portrayal of him... from his innate abilities, combat prowess, dry humour, and brooding \u2018hmmm\u2019s\u2019. \nI\u2019m actually looking for you to play an OC in this case, if you do not have one, do not fret, as I am very much up to helping you make one. But, if you have cultivated one already, then all the better. I ESPECIALLY have interest in an Elven OC! \nFinally, I must disclose than this RP will have a plethora of mature themes, as per the Witcher universe\u2019s rules. Gore, strong language, romance and of course sex. This is NOT a smut Roleplay; I just believe sex comes naturally along with romance. \nI believe that\u2019s enough information and formalities, so I now shall present my plot:\n\n\nThe White Wolf, or the more elegant \u2018Gwynbleidd\u2019 as his name was known in Elder Speech. A man who seemingly is infamous and simultaneously unknown... peasants simply spy a Wolf medallion, and come running to enlist the singing silver sword of the man\u2014 oblivious to who he is. The taverns of Oxenfurt and roaring hearths of Skellige sing and praise ballads about the Witcher... Geralt of Rivia. The Wild Hunt is long since defeated, The denizens of Toussaint saved from a primordial vampire plot- Geralt\u2019s soul reclaimed. Or so he thought. Gaunter O\u2019Dimm, a being, specimen of immense power. His name fits into no language- simply unpronounceable by mortals. While rumours of Zerrikania and Ofier bounce around the isles and Continent- peasants cannot understand, and nobles dream of breaking into uncharted lands. There\u2019s a veil that one would not dare to touch\u2014 not only between worlds, but reality itself. Gaunter O\u2019Dimm, the Caretaker, the Black Cat &amp; Dog... their very essence has imprinted on the Witcher; unknowingly starting a chain of events which the World is not prepared for... a rift. Demons. Redania and Nilfgaard gear up for a final clash, Radovid advances his witch-hunt- simply the world could never be prepared for this, even if it wasn\u2019t vulnerable like its current state. \nWhat would seem to be a yellowed, crumpled piece of paper on a Novigrad notice board, would be the greatest threat to all worlds... the only person capable of stopping it:\nGwybleidd. But Geralt is not alone in his endeavour- a companion accompanies him, with a power they that both are unaware of. Fate has tied her to Geralt, and in conjunction- there may just be hope.\n\n(Please message me if this interests you. I look forward to hearing from you.)",
