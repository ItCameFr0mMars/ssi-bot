            "selftext": "Hi hi everyone! I hope you're all having a fantastic day!! I'd love to find some new RP partners, since I've recently gotten back into RPing and gained some motivation back for writing. I'm a very open-minded individual, who is polite and kind; I won't hound you for a response! I understand we all have lives. Also, noted that my usual \"text speech\" is lowercase, but don't let that scare you! I'm literate and descriptive when it comes to writing.\n\nI. Please no one liners, no god modding, no controlling my characters -- basic RP rules. I don't tolerate any of this.\n\nII. Discord is the only thing I'm comfortable RPing on. If you're interested, just ask and I'll give it to you. :D\n\nIII. My favorite genres are romance, drama, action, adventure, supernatural ( vampires, werewolves, etc ), fantasy ( medieval ), suspense and sometimes sci-fi, but I need to be in the mood. I love fantasy, romance, supernatural and drama the most out of this list, so if you like that, hmu!\n\nIV. NSFW is totally fine with me. I just ask that you're above the age of 18, our characters have chemistry, and the plot doesn't revolve around it.\n\nV. I can do fandom RPs, or original plots that we discuss together. Keep in mind, I usually play OC's in fandom RPs, BUT if you would like to do doubles, I wouldn't be opposed to that. For a list of my fandoms, please contact me and I'll send you a document.\n\nVI. I can play males or females. MxF, FxF and MxM are all something I can do as well, but I prefer LGBT+ pairings most.\n\nVII. Please don't ghost me. If you don't like how our RP is going, dm me and we can fix it together!\n\nVIII. Be respectful. We both have lives and I cannot RP 24/7. Don't spam my inbox, but if I haven't responded within a week, let me know.\n\nIX. Don't be surprised if I try to befriend you. I love to make friends with my partners, it helps us open up to one another a bit more! :D\n\nX. Lastly, if we don\u2019t click or I don\u2019t feel comfortable with the roleplay, I will decline it. We all have a right to refuse a roleplay; please don\u2019t be offended.\n\nI hope to hear from you soon! Bye bye!",

            "selftext": "The Forgotten Knight Awakens in His Dead Kingdom. Medieval Fantasy Roleplay, looking for a partner.\n\nHello to all who find this little plea for a partner who wants to do a medieval fantasy themed roleplay! Hopefully I catch someone\u2019s eye with this. So a little about me, I am a guy who\u2019s above the age of 20 so nsfw or adult themes are alright with me but I will always make sure my writing partner is above the age of 18 and we both have a chat about it before hand to make sure we are both on the same page about it. \n\nI\u2019ve been a writer since middle school and I really wanna stretch my writing legs with this, get something going that could be long lasting with romance or action or anything really! I have a OC I have made specifically for this and I will tell you about him in a moment.\n\nFor starters, we can world build before starting. And I mean we can get very detailed or be very general and think on the fly, I\u2019m very adaptable. \n\nSecondly, my character I\u2019ll be writing as is Darius Alvetto. The royal protector to a now dead kingdom. He had lain dormant for thousands of years and for some reason the flame of life had reignited within him and he awakens to his home being desolate and forgotten. He ventures out into this new world, looking to find out what happened to his home and what this new world has in store for this Knight. Of course there is more I can reveal about him but this should be enough for now. \n\nAnyway, if this has caught your eye please shoot a response or a pm! I\u2019ll be happy to answer any questions you have, don\u2019t wanna leave any of my writing partners in the dark.",

I don\u2019t really care how much you write, just as long as it\u2019s moving the story forward, but preferably stay away from one liners and super short posts. I know everyone makes mistakes but I would like to be able to understand the basic content of your messages. It\u2019s really just quality over quantity. \n\nIf any of this caught your attention feel free to message me or leave your discord (preferably) and maybe a little bit about yourself if you\u2019re up to it!!",

I\u2019m 23 I\u2019ve been roleplaying for about 5 years to various extents. I predominately rp in the third person and my posts range from just a couple of sentences to paragraphs depending on the situation. I also live in the US Incase you may be curious.\n\nAs for the rp itself I have nothing exact in mind. I firmly believe that role plays must be tailored to the dynamic we wish to share. That being said I do have vague plots we can use to set the foundation of our story but I\u2019d like to see if we can create something for ourselves. I\u2019m willing to play any of the main citadel species so there is that added measure of flexibility. But what species I chose depends on the rp we make.\n\nAs for you I don\u2019t mind what kind of lengths your posts are written in. I only ask that you help drive the rp forward in meaningful ways. Too many times have I had partners that act as mere bystanders to the events that unfold. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested feel free to dm me. We can discuss more there.",

I'm a pretty literate writer, I like to write about a paragraph per response. If you want to write more I encourage it! I try to match length as much as possible. I write in the 3rd person and I can do multiple characters at a time.\n\nWhat I'm looking for is someone who can post more than once a day. Someone who likes to worldbuild and create characters. I love ooc chat and would love if we could gush over our characters and set up pintrest boards or playlists. I'd like to become actual friends with you if that's possible! I find that being friends really helps the roleplay process.\n\nSome genres I like are Sci-fi, Fantasy, Modern Fantasy, and Slice of life. Some tropes I love are enemies to lovers, best friends falling in love. I would like this story to have a good amount of romance and angst in the story and definitely some adventure! I'm okay with NSFW just as long as it makes sense in the story!\n\nIf any of this interests you, please let me know!! (: I prefer PM's by the way!",

Introducing new characters and other elements of the story is what makes a good story to me, so please at least try to give me that in return.\n\n-this is NOT A SMUT OR ROMANTIC RP.\n\n-with that being said, this will be a very graphic and disturbing RP. This is an RP dealing with heroes and the underground crime world, so expect subjects around that.\n\n-please don\u2019t make your character someone who never gets hurt both physically and mentally. Those are very boring characters",

During holidays it'll be quite a lot more - so as you see, it fluctuates. Usually I will be able to get out at least one, probably even more posts out a day. Post lengths do vary, but can easily jump between two paragraphs to a lot more, depending on what's going on. I value detail and descriptions in writing and ask that you try to use proper grammar as well - although I of course won't rip anybody's head off for some mistakes, especially if you're tired or have a lot going on next to writing. It sure happens to me now and then.\n\nThere won't be any smut in my roleplays, except for fade to black, so if that's a deal breaker for you, I wish you all the best and good luck in your further hunt!\n\nI absolutely adore any kind of fantasy, it has been a long time favourite for some years now. It doesn't matter if it's set in modern or medieval times, as long as there's a lot of room to further imagine and add things, characters, countries... and so on!Romance and adventure are cherished, but so are a bit of horror elements. Thinking of it, something in a similar style to the Dresden Files would be great - or even some cliche arranged marriage plot in medieval times. Heck, I could see cliche plots of that kind in modern times as well!\n\nMy main characters are usually female, but there's always more and more other characters joining in, some I've had for a long time and some I've recently thought of that could fit in.\n\nI admit to being chatty and I love to OOC with my partners if we mesh well, be it about the story itself, hashing it out further or even just about the weather, work... whatever. Since I adore it's server system, I currently solely use Discord.\n\nCurrently I don't have anything set in mind but I love to share ideas and set a plot with my partner together.\n\nOh dear, I'm babbling on again, don't I? Sorry about that. Have I sparked your interest? If so, DM me and we can look more into it.\n\nHope to hear from you!\n~Lynne",

I work full time, and sometimes stuff happens and I'll need a few days' respite. You know how it is. I will always let you know if I plan to take some time off.\n- I typically average about 2-3 paragraphs but can easily exceed this if things are flowing.\n- World building. I love it. We'll get on well if you like mapping out the universe behind the story.\n- Expect reference images and occasionally memes. \n\nIdeally, you will fit this criteria:\n\n- Human\n\nI currently have two prompts that I am looking to do:\n\nFall of the CES Malus\n\nIn the near future a huge research ship returning to Earth is stricken with a shipwide virus that rapidly zombifies almost the entire crew. We are two survivors, with a mission to live long enough to get back home.\u00a0Expect monstrous horrors, panic-stricken survivors, and some twists in this one.\n\nPairings: M/F or F/F\n\n\nA Prelude to the End\n\nAn RP focusing on the gradual and inevitable end of the world, by way of a natural disaster or man made/natural virus. I want to follow two people, close friends or colleagues, who realise that in their final hours they have feelings for one another. It would be similar to Season 1 of Fear the Walking Dead showing a gradual breakdown of society, law and order. Depending on how this one goes, this could extend into the post-downfall era with our characters surviving in a new and vicious world. This is my first choice.\n\nPairings: M/F or F/F\n\nIf either of the above interest you, or if you want to bring your own idea to the table, message me! I've done a lot of different genres and always open to trying new ones.\n\nAny pairings welcome. \n\nCheers!",

            "selftext": "Good evening r/Roleplay~\u2661!\n\nI hope all of you are doing well and are staying safe in these uncertain times. This is my first time posting here, so forgive my being overly formal and a bit awkward!\n\nAs the title states I'm looking for a medieval or modern fantasy romance roleplay, preferably long-term! I have a prompt or two in mind if you'd like to hear them, otherwise feel free to give me your own ideas if you have them as well!\n\nI'm 24 years old, I'm a RN who works long shifts so RP is a way for me to unwind and escape from the chaos I deal with daily. Because of my job, I may only be able to reply once or twice a day, just to let you know in advance what you'll get on the days that I work. On the days I have off, I can reply multiple times a day and if I am unable to get you a response I'll let you know in advance. I'd consider myself a literate writer, I average 4 to 5 paragraphs per post (or somewhere between 600 to 1000 words) depending on the scene/situation. I've been actively involved in roleplay for roughly 7 years and have been involved in all types of rp; forum, in-game (mmorpgs), one on one and large skype/discord groups.\n\nI am okay with NSFW themes, smut and or darker themes, I just prefer smut not to be the focus and for characters to have chemistry. I don't like to write instant romance and prefer a slow-burn kind of relationship. I'd appreciate not being ghosted, we're all adults so if you're not interested anymore I don't mind being told that you aren't keen on writing anymore. I prefer being told rather than left in the dark, I can't improve myself as a writer if I'm not told what I've done wrong. But please note there is a difference between giving critique and being hateful, I won't tolerate anyone being outright rude for the sake of it.\n\nNow that all of that serious stuff is out of the way, hopefully I haven't run everyone off! \n\nI am LGBTQ+ friendly, my pairing preferences are FxF or FxM (with preference to playing female). I'll leave list of potential pairings, in italics is the role I'd prefer to play, (\u2606) marks the ones that have ideas. If something doesn't have italics I'm open to either role. Let me know if you're interested in hearing the ideas I have.\n\n\u2022 Orc/Demon Warlord x *Elf/Human/Other* \u2606\n\n\u2022 Fae King/Queen x Human \u2606\n\n\u2022 Witch/Wizard x Familiar\n\n\u2022 Immortal x Non-Immortal\n\n\u2022 Dragon (Shifter) x Dragon Hunter/Sacrificial Offering \u2606\n\nMessage me via DM or chat request. I roleplay on discord and/or email.",

I\u2019m not saying you need to talk to me every hour of your life, but if you\u2019re gonna be gone for a while a heads up would be nice.

Werewolf- I play a wandering monster hunter who is hard by a city lord to hunt a werewolf that has been terrorizing livestock. After tracking it down, I find it\u2019s you, the lord\u2019s son. Rather than killing you, I offer you to come with me to seek your cure while we hunt together as partners...maybe more.\n\n2. Squirrel princess- this one is a bit silly, but fun~ you are an adventurer who, upon waking up in you camp, discovers you\u2019ve been shrunk to the size of a mouse! You run into Someone who has suffered a similar fate. Together you must defeat a mad wizard to change yourselves back!\n\n3. The forest Nymph- this one is a modern fantasy. You play a park ranger who catches the eye of a forest nymph for your kindness towards the forest and animals. More focus on romance that adventure is this one.\n\nFor all, I\u2019d like. Healthy mix of adventure, romance, and smut (to taste). Please DM me for my Kik and what story you want to play. More info available, just ask ~",

The only sounds around her in the deafening silence of the room, is the tick tock of her wall clock and the rain tinging on the window.\u00a0\n\nHer heart is still pounding in her chest. Her lips still tingle from where\u00a0his\u00a0touched, the remnants of his kiss feeling like a bruise upon them now. She still feels like she can\u2019t breath, but every time she is with him somehow she\u00a0forgot\u00a0to breath, so that\u2019s not a new feeling. Though this time, that feeling goes along with his touch, like his finger tips are tattooed upon her skin. The memory and feeling of his hands on her, replaying over and over in her mind. It had felt so natural, so normal,\u00a0so right.\u00a0\n\nHow she could love someone this deeply, this\u00a0intensely, and someone who\u00a0never\u00a0actually belonged to her,\u00a0was crazy.\u00a0\nShe felt like a rag doll, like a puppet, like she was always dancing on his strings. The stings that he controlled fully\u00a0and\u00a0entirely. Not in the sense that he did it on purpose, more in the sense of her own feelings. She\u2019d do anything for him. When he called, she would go running. If he ever needed anything, she was there in a heartbeat, and with a smile on her face.\u00a0\n\nI mean, it wasn\u2019t one sided, he did the same for her. Every time she ever needed him, he was there in minutes. He is\u2014was\u00a0her best friend. Her childhood crush. Her adulthood love. Though he never knew any of this.\u00a0Not till tonight at least.\n\nHe\u2019s getting\u00a0married, and to the love of his life, in a week. Just 7 days until she loses any chance at her one true love. At her happily ever after. At the life she'd always dreamed about, the relationship she'd always craved, and the man she had\u00a0always\u00a0wanted. The one all others are put up against,\u00a0instantly, but never even come close.\u00a0\n\nBut maybe she never actually had a chance to begin with.\u00a0\n\nHey, everyone! \n\nI hope you all are doing fine and keeping well. If you have read the entire thing- thank you, haha! I know its a tad bit long but its an idea I've been dying to roleplay with for the longest time!\n\nI'll cut right to the chase now:\n\nIf you are interested and above 18, then please do PM me. I would love to listen to your feedback and would love to hear what you think!\n\nxx",

While law-abiding citizens look to the Jedi with respect and inspiration, the Galactic Republic\u2019s enemies regard the Jedi with suspicion, fear and anger.\n\nThe success of the Sith Empire's military campaign during the Great War saw the deaths of thousands of Jedi. During the Sacking of Coruscant, six Jedi Masters of the Jedi High Council were killed along with several others, and in the time since, the Sith have started their own recruitment campaign to seek out Force-sensitive children around the galaxy.\n\nThese catastrophes have damaged the Galactic Republic's faith in its legendary protectors, but they are far from defeated. Overwhelmed but fearless, the Jedi remaining have gone into exile or hiding, or they have turned over to the Galactic Empire and joined the Sith and been corrupted. \n\nThe Jedi are being hunted by the Sith and will be killed on the spot if found. The galaxy has lost its faith in the peacekeepers. The few and the brave still hiding or are in exile, it is up to you to save the galaxy before Jedi and republic are just legends in history! \n\nWill you start a rebellion? Will you head the call? The Galaxy needs you now more than ever!\n\u2517\u254b\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u25e5\u25e3\u25c6\u25e2\u25e4 \u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u254b\u251b\nWe are a relatively new server, with a roleplay that takes place in the universe of the popular series; Swtor.

            "selftext": "We live in a world where roughly 6% of the earths population has some sort of ability. Those affected are called prodigies. Some prodigies grow up and use their power to help (Heroes), while others use it to harm (Villains). Some of them, though, just want to live their lives as normal citizens.\n\nYou were born of prodigy descent, meaning both your mother and father possessed some sort of ability. Your mother was a hero who fell in love with a villain, resulting in the birth of you. Before you were born, your father was locked away for his crimes and your mother fell out of her profession to raise you.\n\nEvery year in the middle of July, the council of your state holds the trials, in which the state\u2019s prodigies may enter in hopes of landing a job as a professional hero. Because of your relationship with your mother, you\u2019re one of the people set to oversee the trials. You and almost a dozen others will help determine who should go on further to train, or who should be rejected. My character would be someone attending the trials in hopes to become a hero.\n\nI hope you liked my prompt! I can play as male or female, and I\u2019ll gladly roleplay with anyone who messages me regardless of what gender you are or what gender you\u2019re playing as.

I like creating my own characters and roles, so Fandoms would generally be off the table but that is about it. \n\nI look for roles that don't fizzle away after the initial comeback, get together or climax if it is long term. \n\nMy list can be easily modified to fit your wants.

Depending on what is discussed beforehand the limits and intensity of possible romantic connections will be determined.  \n\n\nI am planing to play as new student in a liberal arts collage out in the middle of the U.S. The idea is that he just finished moving with his family, and due to his Empathetic gift, he struggles to deal with normal day to day life. On his first day of classes he bumps into another student and asks for directions, discovering they are heading to the same class. For some reason or another, they eventual learn about his 'gift' and are able to help him become more stable.  \n\n\nI am willing to RP this idea in a variety of ways, and am in not way stuck to this particular path, but the idea of living as an Empath is one I'd like to flesh out more fully.  \nDM if interested, I'll get in contact soon as possible.",

I\u2019m nearly 30 so I\u2019m looking for partners who are at least 20 (it\u2019s just a comfort thing on my part). I also only rp in 3rd person, and I prefer mxf or fxf for pairings. I also primarily play female characters but will happily play some male side characters when the situation calls for it. As far as length goes I\u2019m not super picky, I just prefer to post match.\n\nOkay, so now that that\u2019s out of the way! I rp a lot of romance, but I also love platonic family plots. I don\u2019t have any one idea but quite a few bouncing around in my head but I would love to hear others as well! As far as genres I rp I\u2019m mostly into some fandom ( Harry Potter, Star Wars Disney/Fairy Tales, and Marvel and DC), historical plots, fantasy and sci-fi, and slice of life, I also like some supernatural plots, as well as a few other things too! I\u2019m up for just about anything right now and I do have a few ideas! I\u2019ve got a sort of slice of life family plot in mind as well that I wouldn\u2019t mind going into with someone and maybe giving it a shot! It could definitely be tweaked for multiple genres though!\n\nTo talk and plot more just message me on here and we can trade discord handles. I\u2019m currently central time but I\u2019m not working for the next few weeks and am up fairly late.",

Or if you prefer to take a more \"Dm role\" that can work too \n\n\nROLES\nPlease note these are vague descriptions.

(This role is one requiring you to be able to play various characters rather than just one main, the story follows a modern day soviet russia, the lives of inhuman people and what happens next)\n\n3. Demon x demon \nA medieval style world, demons lurk in the darkness, one is stuck to earth by a curse has lived secluded for centuries, her personality and  odd presence there causes unwanted attention; demon lords too powerful for earth however notice the rise in power; unaware she is the source but soon enough they begin to fight each other to be the first to claim it. Freind or foe of the woman who possesses it.\n\n4. Apocolyptic \nBased in a war gone hot and leading the world into ruin where survival is dictated by one owns initiative, there are no laws, while many simply want to rebuild a life many still fight amongst themselves over empty wastelands and non-existent power.\n\nDM ME WITH ANY QUESTIONS AND THE ROLE YOU WANT MORE DETAILS ON]\n\n\n\n\n[SERIOUSLY dont comment cause i wont see it]",

We could both write the plot as it develops, or you could take the lead. I never played with a GM before, so that could be interesting, but it's not necessary.\n\nThe main point of the story would be the romance between our two main characters. I like fast paced romance, somethig most people tend to avoid for some reason, but it's not a must for me. You don't need to be the most literate partner in the world, just show some effort and I'll do the same.\n\nMoiraine is a tiefling with bright purple eyes and blue skin, with freckles on her nose and cheeks. Her hair, a darker tone of the same color, falls in curls to her shoulders. Her horns are curved, ironically like those of a goat, growing from her temples. She is as old as twenty-three winters, with a tall built, standing on 6'2.\n\nThe tiefling has a jouful and jovial, who gets at ease with any kind of company. She is used to the discrimination from the common folk towards her species, and pretend that trivial and petty things like those do not  bother her. However, after years living with this burden, her self-confidence was deeply affected. Compensating for her own pride - or the lack of -, she likes to make other people more at ease with their own social issues, trying to make conversation with even the most shy and introspective.\n\nHer humor isn't easily affected, but Moiraine does not take any kind of offense towards her friends, and condemns any kind of animal cruelty. Despite her usual kind and lovely mood, some few situatuons can trigger her 'bad side', of which she isn't proud. Moiraine is a mage scholar, specialized in the history of the continent and the kingdom's politics. She abandoned her studies with her master, Kairon, after some... disagreements between them, and she has been on her own since then. She wears a light dress for traveling, bound by a corset, and a green cape with a cloak. She carries a backpack with some few belongings and food for the road, and her staff always on her right hand.",

Looking to create OC characters from scratch along with an entertaining plotline.\n\n*We can do a long term or short term roleplay. Every story has a beginning and an end! I don't expect things to last forever but I am not opposed to creating multiple rps with the same partner!*\n\n**A little about me as a roleplay partner:**\n\n* I can get super into our roleplay and characters. I'm the type of person who would spam discord/tumblr in the middle of the night because I got a surge of inspiration.\n* I will most likely send you inspiration images, gifs, and songs that make me think of our roleplay and characters.\n* I love to plot connections and I am not opposed to roleplaying multiple muses.\n* Write a novel with me &lt;3 I love long replies, but it doesn't always have to be long! Sometimes the story takes us in different directions and that's totally ok.\n* I like making pinterest and aesthetic boards that depict my characters!\n* I don't want just a writing partner, I will also be your friend &lt;3 we can chat about our lives OOC and form a friendship outside of our muses!\n\n**General Roleplay Preferences:**\n\n* I have a few plot ideas but would love to hear yours as well! We can come up with something together :)\n* I like using faceclaims  *(preferably actors and actresses)* to portray our characters. This is important to me so if you roleplay with realistic faceclaims that would be amazing!\n* We can talk muses! I prefer to play females as main characters - although to be honest I have been playing mainly males in the past. I could definitely play male as secondary!\n* I write in third person POV\n* I prefer more mature muses (20+) and would prefer to roleplay with someone closer to my age group. (I am 27 - willing to roleplay with anyone 20+ bonus points if you're 25+)\n* I can roleplay on Discord or Tumblr\n* I usually roleplay FxF or MxF\n\n**Current Kicks (Plots)**\n\n* Would die to plot with someone who is interested in doing a Witches rp (we can plot together! Thinking of an original plot inspired by Secret Circle and Charmed in a modern setting. Obviously not looking to RP canon characters, I'm all about that OC life!\n* If you're not into the whole witches thing, I would be willing to roleplay something else!\n* **Styles that I am interested in:** Horror, Drama, Supernatural, Crime, Film Noir, any type of City or Town rp with underlying secrets, Romance *(sucker for ships)*\n\nTell me what you're into right now!\n\n**Message me if you're interested! Let's talk!**  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;*Please note that I will try my best to reply to everyone. But for the love of roleplaying, please don't just send me a message saying \"hi\" - or \"I'm interested in roleplaying with you.\"*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Tell me about you, your characters, what you like to roleplay, what specifically you're interested in. You know, make it catchy and worth answering lol I believe in you!*",

I'm looking for someone to write with me through Reddit PMs (if you prefer email, I can do that too, but these are the  only two venues I use at the moment)! I only write clean/fade to black!\n\nThe plot is pretty straightforward: Characters A (yours) and B (mine) have known each other since they were children. They grew up in the same poor part of their city and went to school together. After high school, though, their paths stopped crossing for a while.\n\nUntil they crossed again. Now young adults, A is making his way up the ranks in the Mafia, and B is still living the life or a poor girl with honest values.\n\nI would love for them to reconnect as friends first and then that spark gets it to go deeper than that, with all of the secrets and drama of a life between two vastly different people!\n\nI'm okay with short posts, not a stickler for grammar, and can offer at least one post per day, often more!

            "selftext": "Hey all! Thanks for looking at my post here! I'm on the lookout for a new roleplay partner, specifically, someone who is wanting **to play as a woman while I play as a man.** Big emphasis there. That means I\u2019m primarily looking for other women to rp with. \n\nTo introduce myself, I'm a 25-year-old woman from the eastern time zone. I write in third person past tense, and I only am interested in writing with someone who has a similar style. I don\u2019t roleplay with first person at all, sorry ahead of time. I am looking for someone who is interested in roleplaying a romance story with me-- romance is key in the story to bind our characters together, and it makes writing (in my opinion!) so much more fun. Discord is my favorite platform to use, but I am willing to wrangle with Reddit as well. \n\nI do enjoy Mature scenes in the writing, but if you\u2019re not comfortable with that then that is more than alright, just tell me what your boundaries are and I am happy to respect them.\n\nBelow are some of the genres and fandoms I'm willing to try out. If they are marked with an asterisk then I have special interest in them at the moment:\n\n**Fandoms**:\n\nAvatar the Last Airbender****;\n\nDragon Age;\n\nWitcher;\n\nEragon*;\n\nGame of Thrones*\n\n**Genres**:\n\nFantasy*;\n\nSci-Fi;\n\nDystopian;\n\nHistorical*\n\n**Original Ideas**:\n\n**The Dragon's Prize**\n&gt;For countless eons the dragon has been *there*, living atop the tallest summit in a cave that no human had ever seen and lived to speak of. He is more myth than reality now, a story that is whispered about but no one has verified in centuries. Still, despite the lack of proof to his existence, the numerous small villages nestled within the Barrens-- a massive stretch of tall, jagged peaks-- would often leave sacrifices for their hidden overlord. These sacrifices, considered tithes by those who worshipped the mythical beasts, consisted of gold, food, art, and, in times of great uncertainty, people.\n\n&gt;War is on the horizon, with the small villages of the Barrens caught in between two nations who have been at odds with one another for nigh on a decade. The death of a royal in one nation sparks a fire of violence and hatred, and the armies gather to put an end to the lasting troubles. The villages caught in between, a world away from the violence but locked in the warpath anyways, are desperate for help, and arrange a sacrifice to be sent to the Guardian of the Peaks. \n\n*In this one, I would be playing the dragon and you would be playing, well, whoever you want! The obvious is the sacrifice, but it\u2019s not the only option. How you want to play your character is entirely your call, she can be a damsel, a warrior, a dragon hunter, a bounty hunter, a hero, anything you want. Message me and we can brainstorm!*\n\n**A Queen\u2019s Right**\n\n&gt;Once, the coastal nation of Abarra was known as a small, but wealthy nation reliant on dyes, seafood and pearls to fill their treasury. The nation, too small for a standing army, has kept its power through politics and diplomacy, but it seems as if honeyed words and jingling purses are not always enough. As war looms on the doorstep of the nation, the Queen of Abarra has shuttered its borders, hoping to withstand the assault by way of avoiding notice. Unluckily for her, war is expensive, and the wealthy, helpless nation is far too tempting to pass up. \n\n&gt;War, brought by the Invicte Empire, has left the continent in ruins. The black-clad army has trampled over all opposition, storming cities and raising a black flag with a golden dragon-- the mark of the Empire. Now, the mysterious leader of the army has locked his eyes upon the small, sheltering nation, and he will take it in any way that he can.\n\n*So for this one, it\u2019s going to be a bit more of a political story. I will play the conquering Leader, you will be the Queen. Lots of opportunities for this one!*\n\n**Shapeshifter**\n\n&gt;Her people fought, but her people lost. They are shapeshifters, creatures of magic and mysticism in a world where magic has long since faded from view. When humans stumbled upon them they first tried peace, but humans have no love for peace. Where the shapeshifters had tooth and claw, humans had steel and iron. It was no contest. The men were killed, the women, taken. Trophies. Some were given to the generals, to the commanders, to the king. Others were sold, going for hundreds of thousands of gold coins. A shapeshifter who can become anything, what more could be better?\n\n*You will play the Shapeshifter, I might play as a General, or a buyer, or maybe even a hero who wants to save your character. Tell me what you\u2019re comfortable with and we\u2019ll go from there!*\n\nAnyways, I think that\u2019s more than enough for now! If any of these are of any interest to you, or you think that you have an idea I might like, then please reach out!\n\nThanks all!",

The world in question is a medieval fantasy world that is meant to combined my love of history, science, and fantasy. I want to develop a more realistic take on the fantasy genre. The world is my pride and joy, and I love to talk about it. If you are at all interested in this rp than contact me and I can tell you more about it. Role play, I have found, is a very good way to flesh out the finer details of the world, and you would be doing me a great service by doing it with me.\n\nI'm looking for someone who likes world building, or who is a world builder themselves. I am 17 years old, in the very likely case that you have an 18+ age limit. I role play on discord, and might not be the most consistent with my reply times, just a fair warning. I hope to hear from you soon.",

            "selftext": "Hello friends!\nI\u2019m looking for partners for a few projects I\u2019ve had noodling around in my brain for some period of time. I\u2019ve taken some time off from writing because life but I need the outlet again.\n\nI\u2019m looking for long term partners. The majority of these will have NSFW themes, and we can discuss the comfort level privately. I\u2019m a firm believer in open communication between partners! I\u2019ve usually used email for the role play itself, or Google Docs, and Discord for OOC chatting when we like. I\u2019m open to new platforms but I do have preferences.\n\nI\u2019m also one of those horrible people who loves cannon x OC characters, so strap in! As for the cannon characters, I\u2019m completely fine with my partner taking creative licensing with them. Deviation from the original gives them our own twist, and if you want to play them 100% to character, that\u2019s fine too!\nI\u2019m a woman but I\u2019ll write with anyone, but currently I\u2019m looking for FxM writing!\n\nHere are my ideas so far, please let me know if you\u2019re interested in any!\n\n\u2022Sherlock Holmes x OC - High Conflict Holmes - This idea has them at their pique personalities; Holmes is a misanthropic, workaholic addict and she\u2019s an enabling, misanthropic glutton for punishment. She knew what she was getting into, yet here she is, still stressed, upset, anxious. Initially this focuses on their relationship issues and develops into a fuller story. The dark side of Holmes and the OC are at the forefront of this piece in the beginning. The idea behind this one was a slow burn, rediscovery of each other.\n\n\u2022Sherlock Holmes x OC - Becoming a Man - Holmes is an accomplished detective but the one thing he can\u2019t seem to figure out is what to do with the coroner with whom he\u2019s suddenly found himself singularly enamored. Ignore her? Ask her out? Cast a line and hope she bites? This one begins with exploring all the awkward feels of an inexperienced Holmes trying to connect with a peer and potential love interest.\n\n\u2022Khan x OC - He\u2019s been frozen for however many years, unaware that his bride\u2019s memory has been completely wiped. As far as she\u2019s concerned, she\u2019s a loyal member of Starfleet. They took her in after her accident, fed her, cared for her, nursed her back to health, and now she functions as a young up and coming officer. She has no idea her true capabilities, her past, her skills, or her future. But he does. And when he\u2019s awaken, his first mission is to find her.\n\nI\u2019m also all for slice of life RPs, true crime world building, and anything you may have to throw at me. I\u2019m looking at getting back in to writing. The worst I can say is no! \n\nFeel free to DM me! Let\u2019s talk!",

            "selftext": "I\u2019ve done this a few times now. I\u2019ve gotten pretty decent responses for this roleplay idea, but through the power of trial and error I think I\u2019ve gotten closer to perfecting it. I will have an idea listed below, but this is about; our characters, story development, and potential growth. That means that there are plenty of ideas we can think up Inorder to benefit the story. NOTHING IS SET IN STONE UNTIL WE WORK TOGETHER. \n\nGreet to meet you all. I\u2019m interested in finding someone who wants to play as either The Avatar (Korra or OC) or a canon character. Besides that there are only a couple rules that I have for partners. Hope to hear from you all soon. \n\n**Rules for my partner**\n\n* You must be over 18, I\u2019m just not entirely comfortable roleplaying with someone younger than that \n*You must enjoy creating plot ideas\n*Both protagonists should eventually find themselves in a romantic relationship with one another. \n\nDon\u2019t take the last one incorrectly, I find that worldbuilding and character development is so much more important. As a secondary romance should be involved. \n\nNow that you made it past that, I can tell you a bit about myself.\n\n**About Me**\n\n* On average I write several paragraphs. This will change depending on the scene, but in most cases I will match my partner. \n* I do write in 3rd person, I could be persuaded otherwise though. \n*I use discord as I find it useful when roleplaying, there is a place for everything\u2026 Plus you can pin important things. \n\n\n**One Plot Idea (OC Avatar)**\nThere is no longer peace in Republic City. Avatar Aang would be surely disappointed in what his vision has now become. A war between Spirits, Benders, and Non-benders has picked up. This has become a civil war, an imbalance of power as things come into fruition. \n\nWith technological advancements, Spirits are forced out of their homes in the City. Non-benders create another uprising, taking \u201cpower\u201d back from the benders. A revolution, one that needed the Avatar to help bring balance. \n\n\n\nThat\u2019s about it! If you\u2019re interested please PM me so we can start discussing characters and later plots, themes, and more. Hope to see you soon.",

Most humans come to LA in hopes of pursuing their hopes and dreams to become an actor or actress on the big screen, however in this case, LA provides a spark of hope for...the non humans of this Earth. \n\nIn this AU all characters from Greek Mythology were born on earth, hidden away with human families, human names, and told repeatedly to hide their powers as they could hurt others or get hurt due to them. However when a young man by the name of Zeus himself travel worldwide to attend this academy with hopes that they too can be understood and heard for once in their life. \n\nHowever, this school has one flaw...Humans. Due to the bustling streets of LA, the academy also offers classes for non hiddens, creating a mix between the two species. How will this play out? That my friend, is all up to you.",

            "selftext": "I've had this idea in my mind about a dystopian world with an oppressive, military government and huge gap between the rich and the poor. Ideally this would take place in a fictional world, maybe even a low fantasy setting? I would like us to create several characters of different backgrounds meaning soldiers, rebels, civilians etc. This would take a lot of world building, so I hope you're someone who is into that. The idea is purposely vague as I believe it's easier for my partner to join in to the story building if we start from scratch. \n\n\n\n\n\nI don't have much ideas for the post-apocalyptic one but it's something I've always enjoyed. Zombies? Pandemic? Nuclear catastrophe? I'm in. Or maybe even something like in Death Stranding? I'd love that. \n\n\n\n\n\nHorror and mystery are also close to my heart, so a small town that looks peaceful and idyllic from the outside but is something completely different when the sun goes down? Everyone is hiding something and everyone has a secret? This idea is inspired by the shows like Dark, Stranger things and Twin peaks. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n I am LGBTQ friendly. In fact, they will be included in my roleplays so I expect you to be comfortable writing them as well. I get that's not for everyone but just saying that now so we won't waste each other's time. I won't write with anyone under the age of 21. I also really, really want someone who is open to writing a lot of different kind of characters and relationships because I get bored easily when things stay the same all the time.",

I\u2019d like to write an office romance plot with someone. Now i would prefer if the pair hated each other to begin with yet were forced together through a project between there two departments and over time a certain affection built over the long nights at work. \n\n\nNow of course this is quite a basic plot and can be changed or tweaked however we see fit. We can discuss any NSFW details in private and our characters through PM. After that we can exchange discord and write over there or here on reddit. Due to personal preference will not write with someone under 18 so please be 18+. Also i have other sloce of life plots if you\u2019re interested in me and not the idea per say\n\n\n\nThis can also include some kind of lockdown rules. Co workers stuck lockeddown together and a romance can build from there to. \n\n\nI Hope to hear from you soon",

I'm 22 and female and am not picky as to who decides to be my partner, I just ask that you're above 18 just as a matter of comfort.\n\n\n\nI'd like to write as Aerith Gainsborough for this story. I'm open to ideas as to who you'd like to write as, but I do have some preferences, most desired being first:\n\n\n\nSephiroth\n\nVincent Valentine\n\nTifa Lockhart\n\nTseng\n\nCloud Strife\n\nZack Fair\n\n\nI'd be interested in a romance, especially with Seph, Vincent, or Tifa. But I'm mostly after in-character banter and perhaps an AU/sequel story. Something where the characters are transported to a traditional high fantasy setting would be fun!\n\n\nI usually write anywhere from a decent paragraph to upwards of five paragraphs, depending entirely on the scope and pacing of our story. I'm not worried about matching the wordiness of a partner and I don't want you to be either!\n\n\nI'm open to writing on Discord, email, or Reddit DMs/messenger. Please let me know what works for you. If you're interested, send me a message including your favorite materia from FF7 so I know you read my entire message. :]",

I'm currently going to school for a BFA in animation and I also work as a librarian.\n\nWith the current on going summer and ever changing state of the pandemic, I have lots of free time in my hands that I would like to fill with a new roleplay! I write past tense, multi-para and literate(averaging around 3-7 paragraphs). I love ooc and making friends with my writing partners! I'm all about sending each other songs, making pinterest boards and just over all screaming about our characters interactions. Nsfw is cool, but not the main focus of the plot. I'm looking for all of this in a writing partner with the addition of them being 18+ \n\nWhat I'm interested in writing is an FxF slice of life/adventure with my character Dorian. She's a 6'2\" girl with lime green hair in long pigtails. Her personality can be defined as stoic, head strong and wildly ambitious.\n\nAs a sort of prompt I am thinking:\nIt's a summer between semesters of college in a small town. Your character comes to this town for the summer(living with a distant relative or just to get away from the city, etc., whatever it may be) and meets my character who is from the town. They get roped into the adventures of summer, its mysteries and maybe a brewing romance.\n\nWhen DMing me with interest I would love to be provided with a writing example! And please say more than \"are you still interested\" I got a lot of messages like that the last time I posted and I ignore them instantly. Tell me more! This is your time to pitch to me that you want to write now that my pitch has gained your interest! If you have messaged me before I welcome you to do so again!",

(The least popular of monsters because of their specific need of human blood.) \n\nLike you, many Vampires choose to disguise themselves as humans for better treatment and privileges as they can infact walk under the sun, the only thing that vampires need to do is not to smile too brightly and avoid mirrors.\n\nIn pretending to be a human, you actually find your life to be pretty successful, becoming wealthy and a Lord, though you do tend to be more introverted for extra procaution.\n\n(That's enough of lore now onto the starter)\n\n\nOn a particularly bright morning, you find yourself dragging your body out of bed and towards your window which faced the field you owned and the local town in the distance. You found yourself admiring the field in front of you for quite a while till you decided to turn your attention to something else, but just as you turn your head, in the corner of your eye you notice something strange. There was a person in your private field! Immediately turning your head back at the stranger to get a closer look, you realised that it was a young woman crouching down staring at something, however you couldn't tell what.\n\n\n\n\n-\nThat was a quick starter for you! This is an action/ drama/ romance between you, a Vampire and me a human and how our relationship grows. Depending on when you reveal who you truly are is up to you. \n\nThis won't just be romance, there'll also be action, violence and a bit of gore of course.

So of course I\u2019d love to find an awesome partner to fill my time! \n\nI\u2019m a female, 23, and in the PST zone of the US. I am pretty literate with tons of roleplay experience and love finding partners I can also be friends with outside of the roleplay. \n\nI would like to play at least one female opposite of a male in this world and I would definitely want some romance in there. However, since we\u2019re creating a sprawling world I\u2019d love to play multiple characters who eventually meet up and I am open to doubling as any gender! \n\nThe world I\u2019m picturing would be in the medieval time frame and I\u2019m a fantasy nerd. We can add whatever supernatural creatures we want here (dragons strongly encouraged) and keep it interesting. I want action, adventure, and romance to be large parts of this. I am okay with darker themes and prefer characters with imperfections who develop throughout the roleplay. \n\nI usually use Discord but I\u2019m open to other platforms. Please send me a message if you\u2019re interested!",

An elf about six foot walks through the woods, a sword on his hip, a bow and quiver on his back. I have red hair in a buzz, slightly taned skin and a stunningly blue eyes. I hear a snap as you stumble out of the woods\n\n\nYour a book worm who never gets out. Your reading your a romance novel, a cheesey spy thriller when after a flash of color you wake up in an odd bedroom as I walk in. You recognize me as the protagonist from the book you were just reading.\n\n\nYou are sitting in a coffee shop absent mindedly looking through the help wanted ads when you stumble across a slightly odd one \"wanted: assistant for private detective agency. Must have a deep curiosity of the unknown, able to accept the odd and strange, and be able to aquire concieled carry\u00a0 license\" out of curiosity and desperation for some form of work you apply. That's when the magic begins.\n\n\nThe world contains magical beings most notably the elves. There isn't a great relationship between the human and elf worlds but it's there. Your an elf who's job is to watch the human police department and your partnered with me. It's tense, and that's before the murders start.\n\nDepending on who you ask the United States has either entered a modern golden age or a military dictatorship. For those elites life is easy, mostly free of labor. Those lower on the totem pole are living a hard life with little between them and poverty. But a resistance has been building up over the years, getting to the point where the junta is starting to get concerned. So they send out young idealistic soldiers into the slums to keep a pulse on things. But it's dangerous for these soldiers. If they're found out they will probably be killed. But even if they keep their cover, more insidious things might creep in. Like love. \n\n\nit's the 1920's and prohibition is the law of the land. On a decent sized barrier island on the Atlantic coast, life appears to be peaceful, or so the officer was told. There are rumors of rum runner's calling to disgorge their foods on the beach and their job was to try and stop this. But nobody said anything about the Vampires or Werewolves.\u00a0\n\n( Hi my name is Max (23), and I'm looking for an rp partner. I prefer discord.

I am 17 and I only roleplay here in Reddit so if you feel like things Ive listed are a nono for you please don\u2019t read any further. If not please continue! \n\nI prefer to play as female in a fxm roleplay. I prefer short and quick lines and I will reply quicker to them but I can also do longer lines, then my reply speed will be 1-3 days max with either 1-4 replies a day depending on how quickly my partner writes back. English isn\u2019t my first language so if there is grammar errors don\u2019t get mad, I am trying my best. I repeat, I ONLY roleplay in Reddit so please respect this. More about basic stuff and rules can be talked in private and I am open to ideas if the story I have isn\u2019t your liking. \n\nWe live in a world where vampires and soulmates are real. Vampires are meant to be soulmates with other vampires but every 800 years a vampire and a human are destinated to be together. The 800 years has gone and now it\u2019s time for another vampire and human to be destinated to each other but there is only one problem, the two species no longer live in peace. Most vampires hate human as they don\u2019t have the same features and are weaker. Vampires aren\u2019t much different from humans except they have fangs which they can hide, they need blood to live, they live forever and they move faster and have better hearing. Vampires can eat human food but it won\u2019t fulfill their needs. You can only be born as vampire or turned by your soulmate every 800 years but other wise humans can\u2019t be turned.\n\nMy character works in a late night diner that is trying to from the 50\u2019s where the servers are skating. Her shift wasn\u2019t supposed to be on that evening but her friend had emergency had she offered to take her shift not knowing it will change her life. The diner served mostly scums who didn\u2019t have manners and she was used to hear nasty comments. \n\nYou and your few friends had decided to go grab a late night dinner to the same place my character worked, Sam\u2019s place. Just like my character you didn\u2019t know your life was about to change. \n\nAs you and your friends walked in to the diner and was met by me you could feel the world changing. Suddenly everything was a little better and you realised you were destinated to be the next vampire to fall in love with a human. You had searched your soulmate for hundreds of years and finally found it. \n\nThis would be story and we would write our story based on this. We can discuss more details in private as I said earlier but this is important for you to understand: This story doesn\u2019t have any other species expect humans and vampires and no magic at all. No superpowered vampires like in Twilight etc. Thank you for reading all the way here and I hope you a wondeful day/night. \n\nAnd please also this was written at 2am and I am not able to reply until after 10pm at my local time since I am busy but I wanted to post this now because I had the idea popped in to my mind. Thank you for your understanding &lt;3!",

I hate being the creepy old person. I'm in search of a long-term writing partner who is interested in a m/m romance.\n\nHistorical fiction is my favourite genre but I'll consider fantasy if it draws heavily on historical elements, like Captive Prince and Game of Thrones. I struggle with modern and futuristic settings.\n\nI write in third-person past-tense and prefer to post over e-mail, but I have Discord, LINE and Skype for casual chat.\n\nCharacter flaws are wonderful, and character conflict should carry the roleplay as much as an underlying plot. I like stories and growth, not slice-of-life. \n\nI can't write existing characters from shows, books or games. Sorry! Lots of love for my fandom writers, though. \n\nPlease collaborate with me! Let me know what *you* enjoy and what *you're* looking for. Let's discuss the subtleties of our characters, the direction we're heading in, and if we hit any bumps, how we can work through them. I love talking OOC and getting to know the person I'm writing with.\n\nSend me a PM or post below for contact information.",

            "selftext": "Happy Friday everyone! Hope you're all staying safe and being careful.\u00a0\n\nAs mentioned in the title, I'm currently interested in an rp that takes place in either a cyberpunk or a victorian setting. I don't have a specific scenario in mind, as I prefer we develop one together so that it's something we're both equally passionate about and excited for. I will provide simple lists to give you an idea of what I'm looking for, though.\u00a0\n\n&gt; Cyberpunk : Action, crime, romance, possibly some sci-fi elements. Something gritty set in an unforgiving city where the extremely wealthy quite literally live above the impoverished ground-dwellers. Our characters could be looking to make a change, or using the state of things to their advantage.\u00a0\n\n&gt; Victorian : Mystery, horror, crime, romance, possibly some supernatural elements. Something dark set in a developing city where progress is being made with technologies, health science, and social issues. Could be based around a string of mysterious murders, the answer to which could be a literal monster(vampire/werewolf).\u00a0\n\nNow that the general ideas are taken care of, here's what I'm looking for in an rp partner.\u00a0\n\n\u202225+ preferred, but if you're only a year or two off, that's okay with me. (Nothing against younger role-players, I'm just looking for someone closer to my age.)\n\n\u2022Not too far off from PST.\n\n\u2022Willing to play multiple characters where needed, but we'll each only main one character.\u00a0\n\n\u2022Comfortable with mature content, such as violence, gore, and smut. I'm not looking for anything too wild and graphic, but would like to leave our options open in order to enhance the story.\n\n\u2022I don't expect a certain post length or schedule from you, as my own will fluctuate as we go along. However, I do want someone who is inspired and invested enough that it clearly shows in your writing.\u00a0\n\n\u2022Please be willing to move over to Discord.\n\nIf you've made it this far and are interested in developing a story with me, I'd love to hear from you! I just ask that you please DM me first and don't simply send \"Hey I'm interested if you're still looking.\" Send me your ideas, let me know you're serious and excited for what we might create together. Thanks for your time and enjoy your weekend!",

            "selftext": "Greetings and Salutations! My name is T and I hope everyone is safe in their corner of the world. I am 27 and have been roleplaying for a little over a decade now.\n\nA Few Things About Me.\n\nThing 1. I consider myself as a literate individual with a good grasp of the English language. I might not always get everything right but for the most part I do. I try to aim between two to three paragraphs a reply unless I feel the situation calls for more. In which case I will give more.\n\nThing 2. I\u2019m very detail orientated. I try my best to describe things in an all-encompassing sort of way and think that in doing so it brings about a greater story.\n\nThing 3. My replies are sporadic but if I\u2019m into a story I tend to reply more.\n\nThing 4. The biggest thing for me is communication and not doing the aptly named \u201cghosting\u201d. There is nothing more annoying than starting a story, giving my time, and being ghosted. It\u2019s quite honestly the most disrespectful thing you can do to a fellow writer. If you think you might ghost or something please do not message me and save us the time.\n\nThing 5. I am interested in adult themes and content. We can talk more about what that means but that does mean within the romance between the two characters as well.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nToday I have something of an AU idea.\n\nI\u2019d like to do something with Peter Parker and a female version of Harry Osborne. I think it has a lot of potential especially in regard to like Green Goblin. Hobgoblin and things like that. IT could either be in a college setting, adult thing or anything of the like. I think there\u2019s a lot of play here in terms of how \u201cHarriet\u201d Osborne can act and I have a couple of ideas in that regard. So if your interested in plotting it out with me let me know!",

I'm once again pacing this place in search of something fun to do, the topic is obviously in the title so if you clicked, it must be that you are interested.\n\nI'm 20+ years old and so I expect other adults to reply to this.\n\nI have finished both anime and the manga some time ago, so if you haven't read it please let me know to evade spoilers, also I haven't rped as any of the characters from the series yet, so I'm willing to play any canon character if we are in search of some shameless shipping (cause that's where most of the fun is, right?), that meaning, I would like some canon/canon interactions mostly. I'm not versed in fighting style rp, but everything else narrative wise I'm perfectly fine with it, I have 9+ years of rp experience and I'm literate, usually I can put up multiple paragraphs too per reply, but I mostly try to adapt to my partner's replies.\n\nAs for the contents itself of the rp I don't have any plots in mind, but I'm ok with romance, any kind of 18+ content, drama and the like, how much if each we sprinkle into the rp will depend on how you want it, I'm flexible and I don't mind one being more than the other as long as we have fun.\n\nAs for ships, I'm fine with anything you might be wanting to do, as in any character mix, I do have my preferences as everyone else does, but I'm happy to get whatever I can!\n\nAll this being said, if you are in for something more laid back and fast to reply, I don't mind small paragraphs as long as we manage to come up with something.\n\nLast but not least, you can contact me through here  if you are interested, I usually rp through kik (for shorter rps) and Discord (for thicker replies).\n\nThanks for reading!",

            "selftext": "Greetings and Salutations! My name is T and I hope everyone is safe in their corner of the world. I am 27 and have been roleplaying for a little over a decade now.\n\nA Few Things About Me.\n\nThing 1. I consider myself as a literate individual with a good grasp of the English language. I might not always get everything right but for the most part I do. I try to aim between two to three paragraphs a reply unless I feel the situation calls for more. In which case I will give more.\n\nThing 2. I\u2019m very detail orientated. I try my best to describe things in an all-encompassing sort of way and think that in doing so it brings about a greater story.\n\nThing 3. My replies are sporadic but if I\u2019m into a story I tend to reply more.\n\nThing 4. The biggest thing for me is communication and not doing the aptly named \u201cghosting\u201d. There is nothing more annoying than starting a story, giving my time, and being ghosted. It\u2019s quite honestly the most disrespectful thing you can do to a fellow writer. If you think you might ghost or something please do not message me and save us the time.\n\nThing 5. I am interested in adult themes and content. We can talk more about what that means but that does mean within the romance between the two characters as well.  \n\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nToday I am looking for something of a classic story or reimagining. \n\nI am looking for someone to play Vanessa Helsing the immortal. She would be the daughter of Van Helsing who was granted immortality to continue her father\u2019s hunt of the undead and monsters.  This would be a world where the things that go pump in the night are still folktale and myth. How long she\u2019s been doing this and how it all works is up to you. \n\nOn big point will be that she has a lover she keeps running into. A man who is her perfect mate. Their love has been everything from happy to tragic. He wears many faces and guises (but they\u2019re all fetching for her) and is usually identified by his mismatched eyes for her. The only constant is that he always leaves eventually either dying in battle or by old age. It always ends the same\u2026. And though she\u2019s tried to figure out a way to break the cycle so far nothing has brought fruit. \n\nHow they meet in this modern 2020 age and what happens next is something we can figure out. I\u2019d like this to be the reincarnation that breaks the cycle and finally allows them to be together once more.\n\nI\u2019m looking for a Vanessa that doesn\u2019t feel like a young girl. A \u201colder\u201d woman type who is seductive and cunning to him. Someone hardened by millennium walking the Earth and losing her love. I expect her to be a little reluctant but also it to feel like an addiction to both of them a want they can\u2019t shake.\n\nSo if interested reach out to me and let me know!",

I have a  lot  of ideas and I can make a character for just about any situation.  If you think we'd be a good fit message me even if one of my ideas.\n\nOk  so I prefer MxF pairings.  My characters are all very different so lets  talk about what we like. It'd be cool if we were friends. Vent to me,  share pictures of your cat. Show me videos and songs you like.\n\nOk onto my ideas. I've been really into historical settings lately. Here are a few which have grabbed my attention.\n\nREVOLUTION:  1770's in New England. My character could be involved in the sons of  liberty or maybe even a British soldier. There's a lot of fun things we  can do here. Intrigue, drama, historical slice of life. I'm down to plot  all sorts of things.\n\nTHE NEW  WORLD: I've tried to get something going in this era a few times. My  idea was for a Pocahontas sort of story where a soldier or a trapper  happens upon a native girl and something grows between them. If that's  not your style I'd love to try a homestead slice of life. A couple in a  new settlement trying to get by and start a life from scratch.\n\nCOUNTRY  ASUNDER: The Civil war. Not my favorite time period but there's some  room for some good drama here. Is she a southern belle while he's a  union soldier maybe injured in her town? What if he's the master of a  plantation and he's trying to make it through the war while deciding  where his loyalties lie.\n\nSALEM:  Never done this one but the witch hysteria is very close to my heart.  We'd be in Salem during the witch trials but here's the catch. What if  the magic is real. She could be a witch and he could be just about  anything. Would he be scared? What if he had fallen for her before he  knew.\n\nI'm also a good GM and I can double. Lets build a world!",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone! I\u2019m searching for someone to create a story with, preferably long term. I typically like to go off of fandoms.\n\nThe plots/settings I am currently interested in are:\n\n* Avatar The Last Airbender (I\u2019m still working on Lok, so I don\u2019t know too much on it so nothing past that show)\n* Skyrim/Medieval fantasy\n* Detroit: Become human\n* Western/RDR\n\nWhat I\u2019m looking for in a partner:\n\n* Please be at least 18. I\u2019d prefer someone who isn\u2019t too much older than I am.\n* Be able to write at least one good paragraph. You don\u2019t have to write a ton, just one good quality paragraph is fine with me. And have a good grasp with grammar. It doesn\u2019t have to look perfect, but at least know the small stuff like the difference between \u2018your and you\u2019re\u2019. Other than that, small spelling mistakes are okay as I may slip up a few times.\n* Be able to reply at least once a day. Waiting two or more days tends to make interest fade away. I know we all have our own lives, so If you know you\u2019re going to be busy, And I\u2019ll do the same\n* Gender doesn\u2019t matter to me, And your characters could be whatever you want them to be. It doesn\u2019t make a difference to me.\n* Don\u2019t be in it just for the smut. Don\u2019t make it the main goal, I'm okay with some smut, but there needs to be some chemistry between characters so it doesn't feel forced. It can\u2019t just happen without some build up.\n\nA bit about me:\n\nI am 18, and I live in the EST timezone. for my writing, I am in between semi and literate, and I prefer third person in past tense. For my characters, I prefer to play as Oc\u2019s and I am more comfortable with playing females. Although, for side characters I can play as male or female. A romantic subplot is a must for me. It shouldn\u2019t be the main focus but I definitely still want it in there. As for platforms, I only roleplay on discord. Only because of the servers as it helps me organize things for references and such.\n\nNow, If you read through this, Thank you very much! Pm me, and give me a little detail about what you're looking to roleplay and we can see if we're a good fit for each other. But to make sure my post wasn't just skimmed over, please have the message start with your favorite movie genre. I will not respond otherwise. Anyways, Have a good (Day/Morning/Night)!",

Hope you are all staying safe out there. I haven\u2019t posted here for a very long time because last time I hit the jackpot. I got the most fantastic writing partner, we\u2019ve become amazing friends \u2013 and still write from time to time, but between our opposite work schedules we can\u2019t seem to get much done.\n\nI\u2019m not looking to bite off more than I can chew, but seeing as I am working from home now, I wouldn\u2019t mind picking up a bit more writing to help pass the time, and keep my writing fingers flexed. I\u2019m in the Central Time Zone of the US, when you reply let me know what zone you\u2019re from. \n\nTypically, I am safest and most drawn to fantasy/ high fantasy. Though, I\u2019ve been reminiscing of the times I wrote Slice of Life when I was younger and just starting to build worlds and characters. For the right idea I am happy to do a Slice of Life piece. Mostly, I\u2019d like to build an idea with someone from the base up, spit ball ideas until something sticks. You\u2019ll find I\u2019m pretty flexible when it comes to plotting and writing. I\u2019m not looking for perfection, just looking for a good time where we can both have fun. \n\nI am fine with dark themes and smut, but I don\u2019t want it to be the focus of the story. There is nothing like a slow burn to build the tension. I \\*AM\\* looking for a romance, it is my guilty pleasure. Also, as a bi woman, I am open to LGBTQ characters and encourage them! I\u2019m even open to writing multiples and having them intermingle as the story weave together, so it won\u2019t just be X and Y interacting, but X will sometimes interact with A and B, as would Y. \n\nIf you are interested in starting a conversation and seeing how things go and where it will take us, hit me up and let\u2019s get the ball rolling. I write by email but am open to discord.",

Not much grows in the frozen ground, and your people struggle to make a living. To top it all off, the fire people of the East are so close to declaring war on Vengria that both kingdoms are seeking Arraisia\u2019s alliance to turn the tide of battles soon to come.

            "selftext": "Hello!  So I\u2019ve recently got a craving for an rp featuring mechs. I don\u2019t have  an actual plot idea, but the basics is that our characters are in a  military or something (we could also go the darling in the franxx route)  and we\u2019ve got mechs in order to fight monsters and other mechs. We will  create our own custom and unique mechs. Also, rather than \u201ccontrolling\u201d  mechs, you transport your consciousness into the mech whenever you want  to use it. However, you need to link up with it which requires you to  enter it. When you are linked with it, you will suffer the same damage  as the mech, but there is no way for you to die unless your body gets  attacked. So if your mech gets badly damaged, you will also get badly  damaged. Of course it may not be as extreme so you won\u2019t die, but you  will be badly hurt. If the mech gets a cut, you do too. Pretty simple,  right? Also, whenever you transport your consciousness into the mech,  you have full control over it and it essentially feels like controlling  your body.\n\nThis rp will be held on discord. If you are interested, DM me!",

I\u2019m 18, somewhere in the CET timezone. (I have a messed up sleeping rhythm though so your time zone doesn\u2019t really matter) I prefer writing in third person and tend to adjust my text length to my partners, I have to say right now I would enjoy some shorter yet meaningful texts. I can use either discord or reddit to rp. \n\nwhat am I searching for? I have to be honest, I don\u2019t really have any plots or crazy ideas in mind yet. I\u2019m currently really into crime themed stories, so that could be something. other than that I\u2019m open for a dystopian world, an apocalypse, something with aliens, superheroes... I\u2019m also open to hear about your idea if you have any!\n\nsome things I\u2019m asking for: please be around my age and able to be active. I do get that we all have a life and it gets busy at times but right now I would love to have something to get lost in and not just reply once in two days or something like that. and if you ever get busy or don\u2019t like or don\u2019t want to continue for whatever reason please just let me know and not ignore me. \n\nAnyways if you have some questions or this caught your attention in any way, feel free to send me a pm.

I'm Morgan (19) and I have came on here today to look for some long-term partners to spesifically do a roleplay within a couple of fandoms that I enjoy, along with some non-fandom genres I would like to explore if that is not your cup of tea. Though, I will now line out what I require from my partner before I outline what I would like to do;\n\n- Firstly, it's important that you are *atleast* 18+ since I would like to incorperate romance into the story; even if we weren't the condition would still stand. (Not all romance and those themes though I want a story too.) \n- Secondly, I am looking for someone that has experience with roleplaying and writing and someone that can be literate. I don't have a spesific ammount of word-count or length of writing that I prefer just as long as it's well written and my partner has some experience with long-form writing if not roleplaying. \n- Thirdly, I would prefer someone who has time to post around 2-10 times a day I understand if you may have other things going on but I find it hard to keep interest if someone only can post 1-2 times every two days for example. \n\nNow all of that is out of the way here are the Fandoms I would like to do; \n- Marvel (Spider-Gwen/Gwen Stacy, Captain Marvel, Lady Thor, Silk, Magik and Kitty Pryde) \n- DC ( Stephanie Brown, Cassie Sandsmark, Barbara Gordon and Harley Quinn) \n- Handsmaid's Tale \n- Apex Legends/Titanfall (Wattson and Wraith) \n- Fallout Universe (Preferably 4 or 3) \n- Star-wars (any era) \n- Ancient Magus Bride\n- Naruto \n\nI will also mention that I am open to both being an original character in all of these fandoms as well as open to being the canon characters that I listed on the select fandoms. \n\nPSA: Before you respond to me please make sure you put as much information in your message as possible, just a simple line like 'hey i wanna do marvel' will most likely get you ignored. Also please refrain from using the reddit chat system and use the traditional way to send your message to me.",

To give a fair warning, I do plan on including some mature themes, so please don\u2019t hit me up if you\u2019re under eighteen.\n\nEssentially, I have an idea for a early to mid 20\u2019s male character with a rather complex backstory (shocking, I know). He also has his own dark secrets and family members, friends, exes, etc. that\u2019ll come in to play. He\u2019s on the more eccentric and explorative side, so do be ready for that. Essentially, I\u2019m hoping to find a RPer who will make their own character with all their own things and we\u2019ll have a grand time with all the drama.\n\nAlso, we can incorporate other themes if we want to, like crime, urban fantasy, etc to make it more interesting.\n\nIf you\u2019re into this, please hit me up and we can start talking.",

            "selftext": "Deep in the ruins of Karusa Valley north of Gerudo City, A figure made his way through the shadows into one of the storage rooms in the Yiga base room, the light of a wall mounted torch illuminated his face. His eyes were red like the Yiga clansmen he was up against, though his hair was a sharp silverish-white, done up in a ponytail using a strong piece of black fabric. His forehead had the symbol of the Sheikah embedded into his skin in red like a tattoo with his mouth being covered by his thin white mask. His blue clothing was thin for mobility, mostly fabric with the expection of some padding in various spots.\n\nHe crept around the corner of one of the wooden crates, catching a guard enthralled by a banana, which gave him enough time to sneak up behind the clansmen and strike him, knocking him to the ground. He quickly made it through the maze of boxes and into a small tunnel, aiming to crawl through it into the next room.\n\nAs he jumped out of the small tunnel, he landed in front of his prize. It was a Royal Family heirloom he was sent to secure for them. He was so close to his prize and as he reached for it, a sword swung at him from behind. The Sheikah had to act fast, dodging it and sliding further away from the heirloom, only to see three of the large yiga clansmen and four smaller ones. \n\n\"There's no escape...\" another clansment muttered behind him as the final Yiga was revealed above all them, the elder Yiga. He was hunched over, using a staff to walk with the head of the staff a wooden carving of the Yiga symbol. \"We have been watching you try to infiltrate our base... impressive. You would be a fine addition to the Yiga clan, and we can ensure the dark lord's return!\" The elder called out, the cornered shiekah staring and saying nothing. \"Fine then. You will loose your life with no final words to utter.\" \n\nThe elder snapped his fingers, two of the larger Yiga pulling out a device that was connected to an ancient Shiekah slate that have recently been surfacing. It was wired up to a metal weapon of some kind that was lighting up brightly. As the sheikah noticed what the device was doing, he awaited until a red beam of energy was shot at him before he pulled out his chain, whipping it across the room at the heirloom and pulling it back to him. \"No! Get the artifact!\" The elder yelled as the beam struck the sheikah, causing him to break apart in reality as he screamed in agony whioe the technology and magic combo tore his body asunder along with the heirloom, both dissapearing into thin air... only to resurface somewhere else in the bountiful land of Hyrule.\n\nXXXXXXXX\n\nHello there!\n\nI hope that the title caught your interest to my Legend of Zelda prompt! \n\nThis prompt has a lot of build up but it deals with my new Sheikah Character I've named Oleander, named after the flower. My goal for the RP is to have Oleander and your character strike up an amazing relationship that turns loving and romantic as they search for the remaining Heirloom parts across hyrule. They will definately have some side quests along the way which will be fun as well!\n\nOleander will essentially get teleported with a fragment of the Royal Heirloom he was sent to acquire, though the teleportation was extremely painful, leaving his armor torn and ripped with cuts on his body. He will land either in front or around your character, of which i want to be another one of the native races, like a Zora or a Rito or a hybrid thats part Hylian. This could allow for some fun combat and story dynamics with their unique abilities! \n\nAs for the timeline of where this will be set, i figure it would be set before the events of Breath of the Wild or after it as it lets us explore a static version of Hyrule that we can change on our own!\n\nOur characters would be going through the world, accomplishing some goal that the two of us set up for them, be it the plot line of the games or a plot line exclusive to the RP. Above all, I would like our characters to grow together and create a strong romantic relationship with eachother.\n\nNow here is the good part for me, which is what I would like to hear from you:\n\n1. What about the prompt or my thoughts interests you the most? What are you most excited about?\n\n2. What do you have in mind for your character? [Name, Age, species, personality, etc.)\n\n3. Whats your characters clothing color and style?\n\n4. Ask me a couple questions you would like answered! Could be about anything! Writing styles, thoughts on our characters, preferences about our RP or even just how I am doing!\n\nSpeaking of which, how are you doing? \ud83e\udd14 \n\nI will definately get back to you as soon as i can! I hope this prompt caught your attention and thanks for reading!\n\nPS: Prompts from previous posts are open too! Feel free to sift through my post history to take a look at some others!\n\n- Chris",

I\u2019m male and 20 so I just ask that anyone who replies to this post be 18+ to 23 (If you are a bit older I might not mind too much I just prefer to roleplay with people my age. Also I only roleplay with people 18+ because there could be NSFW included in the roleplay stories). Also please have a verified email as I\u2019m not sure how fake accounts are with Reddit. \n\nFor roleplaying I hope to meet someone who\u2019s wanting to do roleplays based on romance and the relationship of the characters in the story. If there is NSFW in the roleplays it\u2019s not something that starts right away but rather during the story it\u2019s something that the characters would progress to. I\u2019m also hoping to meet someone who is open to having the story be long term as well. I totally understand that we all get busy and if you do there is no problem at all. I\u2019m just asking if you get a chance to reply every so often so the roleplay keeps going that would really be great. I also can roleplay in third or first person so I don\u2019t mind either. As for characters if you prefer to only be one character that is perfectly fine as well. \n\nWith reply length I really would prefer someone who can respond with detailed responses. I really have a difficult time responding to short responses. I totally understand we all have our own skill levels and preferences, but I just am able to reply better with longer responses. I understand some parts of the roleplay might require longer or shorter replies but I just mean in general. However, if my replies aren\u2019t long enough to your preference I am more than happy to try my best to improve my responses so I can help to make the roleplay better and to better my skills. \n\nThat is pretty much everything! If you have any questions or are interested please feel free to message me or leave a comment! Currently I only roleplay here on Reddit so I hope that\u2019s alright. Thanks for reading my post!",

            "selftext": " At a young age, my character made a vow that she would become a valiant knight, helping those in need and protecting anyone who can\u2019t fight for themselves.  There was only one problem: Only men could be knights. Still, she remained undaunted.\n\nThe people of her kingdom were known for their long hair, lanky builds, and androgynous looks.  Outsiders commonly joked that the men were prettier than the women. She used this reputation to her advantage and managed to become a squire in a neighboring kingdom. There were a lot of close calls along the way, but she made it through her time at the keep.  Now she would become the personal squire to a fully-fledged knight.\n\nHopefully that brief description caught your interest. I\u2019m looking for someone to play the knight my character will serve. His personality and story are completely up to you! This will take place in a basic medieval fantasy world. Feel free to add bits of lore as needed. I would like a slow-burn romance where she is eventually found out during their adventures. I will only do fade to black. Beyond that, I\u2019m good with both light and dark themes.\n\nI play on discord. My preferred post length is between 1-3 paragraphs, but I can easily write more if you'd like!  I only rp in 3rd person.  If you\u2019ve read this far and are still interested, please send me a description of your knight or any other ideas you have.",

            "selftext": "I like writing pain. Also, master-apprentice stories are a soft spot of mine. I love the idea of writing a character who relies on another for information, advice, reassurance, protection. I love to write fuzzy feelings, like admiration and hair ruffles, and I absolutely love to write darker things too, like the typical shonen anime 'we'll make you suffer to make you stronger' or 'my magical powers are out of control' themes. I also enjoy themes that may or may not be related, such as captor/captive dynamics (eg. inquisitor/witch, dark lord/unlucky hero, vampire/victim etc).\n\nGenre: Medieval fantasy has worked pretty well for me.\n\nI am not comfortable writing romance or smut. Odd as it may be, this is the situation. I enjoy, however, writing intense feelings such as affection and pain. I may enjoy some dark stuff, but too intense dark stuff (eg. GoT, Berserk) is not for me.\n\nGenders: I write female characters. I admit to having a small preference for male or non-binary characters in the mentor/captor role, but I am trying to broaden my horizons.\n\nThe technicalities: I do 3rd person, past tense roleplaying. I prefer GoogleDocs for roleplaying and Discord for ooc chatting, but I can use Discord on its own too. I am 18+, I will only write with rp partners who are 18+. Same with characters.\n\nRoleplaying style: Most commonly I write 400-700 word posts, but can go higher or lower on occasion depending on the context and partner (200-2000). I would prefer someone who vaguely matches this. I don't judge you for preferring fast-paced single-paragraphs instead or perhaps extensive novella-style posts with complex plots, but perhaps consider that we might not be compatible? Previous rp partners tended to like how I deal with description / occasional worldbuilding, but my writing is weaker in other aspects like dialogue. I would really love if my potential rp partner had some level of plot awareness / the willingness and capacity to drive the story forward (I have done a lot of the worldbuilding/ plot driving in my recent roleplays and to be honest I'm a bit burnt out). If you're not sure what I mean by that, let me rephrase: if your normal thinking process is not only 'how would my character respond to this' but also 'what can I give my rp partner to work with', then I'd love to talk.\n\nThe writing samples (to have an idea of my style, but not neccesarily related to the current theme). General: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Iz1E0wu-DWM74p8cAzMWRWQrcaMUJhool6q_FYOps2g/edit?usp=sharing Soul Eater (anime): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Sm3LPJpZnP2zk9m4G8Z1p1BTN2uD9AsdptlNhBtmcso/edit?usp=sharing\n\nNow, if you're interested, I'm going to ask something a bit crazy of you. Would you please give me a roleplaying prompt / a post that includes the character you had in mind? Doesn't have to be long (I'm setting a maximum of 500 words), doesn't have to be precisely the same character you'll end up using, but it would really put my mind at ease. I've had some unfortunate experiences my first times on this forum with having to sort through lots of initial messages and then people disappearing afterwards. Would love to see what you can come up with!\n\nPlease DM your interest! I use OldReddit so the messaging system is unreliable.",

Being the Dragonborn? The savior of Kvatch? Honestly, I am.\n\nThere are so many unsung 'heroes' that go unnoticed or underappreciated. The Khajiit caravans traveling to sell their wares (so long as you have coin,) nameless bodyguards escorting citizens of implied importance, or even the studying apothecary whom is out among the dangers of the world, eating mushrooms and salts that he or she probably shouldn't.\n\nI recently started playing Skyrim again recently, and this is one of those things that seemed to trigger my creativity. The world is so vibrant and full of life, I found myself wondering just what the life of your typical resident would be. Obviously nowhere near as exciting, but I'm sure they found themselves in some trouble now and again. Or perhaps they didn't. Maybe they grew old going about their same routine, gathering fish, drying out pelts to be made into clothing or armor, or simply collecting ingredients to cook their family a nice meal.\n\nThere's limitless opportunity here. I'm more than up for discussing it, seeing where the curiosity of creation takes us.\n\nTake care, traveler. Have yourself a lovely pre-hump-day! :)",

I\u2019d like to play as a new builder. You\u2019re welcome to play anything you\u2019d like be it an OC or a cannon character.\n\nStardew Valley:\n\nPretty much like the above, but in Pelican Town. I\u2019d like to play the farmer OR a farm hand if you\u2019d like to be the Farmer^(TM). I\u2019ve no preference either way. You\u2019re welcome to play anything you\u2019d like be it an OC or cannon character.\n\nI don\u2019t have any requirements on length, but usually do anywhere between 1-3ish paragraphs myself.

I desperately want to do a plot where he\u2019s a struggling bartender that has been unlucky in love and sleeps around, and she\u2019s a breath of fresh air that comes in while bar hopping and they meet *cannot keep their eyes off of each other.* After some flirtatious conversation, she decides to ditch her friends and go home with him, and they have the most passionate night together. He\u2019s feeling like this could finally be something with true potential in his life, **but** it turns out she\u2019s engaged to a wealthy art gallerist, and she\u2019ll never have to work a day in her life if she stays with him.

I also play on Discord, but DM or PM me for nickname first.  \n\n\nI have my favorite settings, which are Classic D&amp;D, Warhammer Fantasy, LoZ:BotW, Witcher and Avatar: tLA. I also like all of RiordanVerse.  \n\n\nHope to hear from you!",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone! My name is Andrew (though you could call me \"Reyne\" too) and I am a 22 years old guy from Europe. I have some years of roleplaying experience, but limited experience with roleplays in English. \n\nI'm really in the mood for something medieval and based in a fantastical world. I like those themes, as well as both romance and drama, action and maybe something darker too, if it's your thing. Not really looking for something overcomplicated, just focusing on the relationship between characters, yet I will be available and patient if we want to plan something bigger.\n\nI have some more or less specific prompts that can still be modified to taste. Some are soft and romantic, some could get darker. Up to us.\n\n1) A dynastical marriage crowns new King and Queen and poses a temporary end to the growing unrest. Will the royal couple survive the court intrigue?\n\n2) A marriage between lord and lady, and hopefully a peaceful life together.\n\n3) After a revolt is suppressed, the trial before the court also determines a marriage has to be arranged between the rebellious family's young daughter and their liege's son.\n\n4) A rich merchant lord takes or buys a lowborn maiden for his own entertainment and pleasure.\n\n5) A city-state threatened by the presence of wandering companies of foreign warriors pays a tribute in the form of marriages to avoid conflict.\n\n6) A powerful self proclaimed Empire is slowly marching forward on their unrelenting conquest. As of the capitulation of another city, it is put under the control of an overlord through a forced marriage\n\n7) Any other idea we have together?\n\nI roleplay both in 1st and 3rd person, present or past tense (beware, 3rd person and past tense is my favourite combination); I am able to roleplay many secondary characters or even two main, and Discord is absolutely my favourite platform.",

            "selftext": "Hiya! Thanks for stopping by! I'll try not to keep you too long. My name's Ayla and I'm 26! I'm a stay-at-home wife with two pups and my amazing husband. Thanks to the virus and my crap mental health, I'm usually home with copious amounts of free time. I've been roleplaying for over 10+ years but took the past year off to focus on my health.\n\nSo, the title kinda states what I'm looking for! The rough plot idea (which can be expanded on of course) is that there's a werewolf pack and the current Alpha only has one child, a daughter. The pack assumes that she'll find a mate and he'll be their next Alpha (the daughter being their Luna, aka the packs Alpha female). No one expects her mate to be a woman though.\n\nI've thought of a few additional details that might be added, it's all up to you! One is that other beings exist that can shift into other animals and the woman is of another race. Perhaps a big cat or even another mythical being like mermaids or gryphons! Another idea is that the woman (&amp; all others) knows that werewolves exist and she detests them for XYZ reason.\n\nPlot ideas aside, here are some things you should know:\n- I only rp in 3rd person, past tense\n- I don't like rp's heavy on sex scenes unless it's important to the plot\n- You should be 18+ (as should our characters)\n- Quality over quantity! Just no one liners please. Ideally a paragraph at least\n- No god-modding, perfect OC's, or killing my characters\n- I'm happy to double up or even play multiple characters so I'd like for you to do so as well (but not required!)\n- I'm fine with F//, M//, FxM, and poly stuff\n\n\nIf you have something else aside from werewolves you'd like to try, drop me a comment or message!\n\nI'll give you my discord handle via PM.

            "selftext": "Ello, it's me. I'm PoorDesign. I am 18 years old and planning on going to college in the near future. I've been roleplaying for nearly 8 years now both on my mobile phone and on computer. I'm on the West Coast of America, so my timezone is Pacific Standard. When it comes to writing, I'll write a paragraph at the least, though results may vary based on a lot of outside factors.\n\nI'd like all my partners to be at least 18 in the possibility that our roleplay will delve into possibly dark and possibly frisky themes. As long as you don't write one-liners, I'm fine with whatever you write. We're all human here, so I'm not going to nitpick any minor spelling, grammar, or organization mistakes if they happen occassionally.\n\nAnyways, here's the prompt.\n\nA simple carriage accident can transform a pompous prince into a short-tempered beggar. Once the heir to the throne of an esteemed kingdom has now found himself stuck in the middle of seemingly nowhere. No carriage to ride in, no horse to pull the carriage, and no servants to provide him with the slightest shred of authority over! That's when he came across [Y/C]. Left with no other option, the prince begrudgingly accepts help and now begins his journey back to his kingdom.",

I lost my old d-cord, had to create a new one, so I\u2019m searching for my old friends, and some new ones. If I seem familiar, please reach out! \n\nJust looking for a buddy or two that can help write some fun stories with me! I don't have any particular ideas, right now. If you do, I\u2019d love to hear them! I love a good fantasy setting, historical setting, sci-fi, but I'm open to collaborating. Having a craving for something dark, maybe with vampires, or werewolves, demons, dragons, or magic. If that\u2019s not your cup of tea, please still message me! I\u2019m NOT into Slice of Life, modern settings, or Fandoms.\n\nA little about me. I'm 27 (so please be around my age. I can't be doing this with an 18 year old, sorry. Maybe 24 and up?) I've been role-playing on and off since I was about 14, so this isn't anything new. I\u2019m on the East Coast of the US. I do work full time, but I\u2019m working from home and can reply during the day and at night. I\u2019d love someone who can send more than one message a day. Reply length doesn't really matter to me, the longer the better, of course, but it's quality over quantity. Txt tlk annoys the bejesus out of me, pls don\u2019t tlk lyk dis. I don't really have any limits when it comes to quantity. I typically play female character, but I'm open to playing both, and am willing to play multiple characters as needed.\n\nAs I said, I don't have any specific ideas in mind, I'd love to hear anything! I can also come up with an idea, if you have none and I like our vibe. Oh! Also, I don't want this to be just business. I'd like to also make a new friend, and occasionally have conversations outside the story. If that's cool with you?\n\nWell, I think that's everything! If you're still here, and are still interested, please shoot me a message, maybe start off with a joke! I look forward to meeting you!",

With that being said, this is what I'm looking for. BTW I ONLY USE DISCORD.\n\n- Anyone over 18 - mostly because I always include darker elements into my Roleplays. NSFW can be included as well, I usually fade to Black but if you insist then I'll deliver.\n\nA moderately clear schedule- Alright I understand people have lives, so do I. I work a part-time job at the moment and sometimes I'm just really busy. All I ask for is that you respond once a day.\n\nDetailed- I like to write sometimes, I can go anywhere from 2 paragraphs to the double the discord limit. Please have range close to this!\n\n\nOOC- I really just want to nerd out with someone over fantasy aspects and become good friends who are dedicated to making a well thought out stories. Please share your ideas and critique mine, I'd love it.\n\nNow I only RP with the Fantasy type of Roleplays, they are the most interesting and have so much to offer with creative world building and characters.\n\nSo please share you ideas or we can create our own!",

Ydin is a body split into 6 clans, each bearing a unique magic which contributes to the survival of the planet itself: the Labra, the Phoenics, the Turists, the Gyars, the Zonites, and the Furterians. Each is rich in culture, magics, and lore\u2026 But, there is not always peace between the clans: border scuffles, battles for resources, and political upsets always exist. However, despite whatever small disagreements may rock those communities, there is a home for anyone, no matter their clan, in the great city of Unilatis.\n\nA land of neutrality built by the scientific conglomerate Y.Co, whose mission exists to ensure that no being is left without a place and a purpose, Unilatis is a beacon of hope and unity in this young world. However, Y.Co has plans for the future of Ydin that go beyond the peaceful city, comprehensive light rails, satellites, and inclusive mynospheres: they look beyond Ydin\u2019s atmosphere, and they see opportunity for growth. Y.Co \u2019s satellites have confirmed that which its denizens always thought: Ydin is alone in the universe, though nearby planets seem - by all means - habitable. Explorable. \n\nThe unknown is a call too great to resist. As everyday life continues in the outlying clan territories, the wilds between them, and the city Unilatis, Y.Co is constructing ships that will one day leave the safety of Ydin behind. Soon, they will venture into the wide nothing of space to see just what lies elsewhere, and in doing so may unravel the mysteries of Ydin\u2019s own history...\n\n\u2026\n\nPlay as one of the unique races of Ydin (each with its own magic, lore, and culture) in an original and vibrant fantasy/sci-fi setting. This is a brand new server, and as such is flexible and welcoming to the growth and ideas that players may bring in. Be a part of something special and truly unique, and watch as the world of Ydin expands beyond what any of her denizens thought possible.\n\nCurrently, play is centered in the city of Unilatis, though more areas of Ydin will open as players join and the world expands, with space travel slated to be introduced further down the road. If you are looking for more of a fantasy roleplay experience, the lands outlying Unilatis will be opened when we reach 15 players, and until then you are able to explore (and create) the more \u2018traditional\u2019 areas of Unilatis itself. If you want a more sci-fi feel, then you will love Unilatis, and the places its inhabitants will travel in the future. \n\nJump right in and [join the Discord](https://discord.gg/BBQR8jw)!\n\n**TLDR; fantasy in the streets, sci-fi in the sheets**",

            "selftext": "Hi everyone! Recently I've found myself on a downward slope in terms of partners. Plenty of people have either stepped back from threads or simply haven't replied, so I'm on the search yet again! I do **paragraph** form roleplaying in **3rd** person over **Discord, canon characters only for fandoms** and for the first time in years, **I'm looking for OCxOC interactions!** Sadly, I'm still not open to doing OC X Canon interactions. I don't always do regular postings but I always, *always* have time to share ideas with my partners.\n\nFirst up is **She-Ra 2018,** and I\u2019m totally caught up, finale and all! I'm open to pretty much anything with this series, AU or canon wise, but I would love to do something involving **Catradora**! I've seen people do pirate, band, magical school and so many different AU's, I would love to try them all! One of my favorites is a She-Ra AU with the bending abilities from the Avatar series, including an Avatar Adora and her friends, water bending Glimmer and sharp shooter Bow, being pursued by fellow firebender Catra!\n\nSecond is **RWBY,** and again, I'm open to plenty of ideas with this, but I have a slight preference towards AU's for this series. I don't mind trying out new ships, the only die-hard one I don't like mixing with other ships is **Arkos**, but anything else, I'm up and willing to try! I would love to dive deeper into Ren and Nora's relationship, or how characters would act in a more dangerous or even horror setting. I'm ALSO HOWEVER A HUGE SUCKER FOR DOMESTIC LIFE WITH SOME FUN AND LOVING SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS\n\nThird is **Apex Legends,** and with this one I'm looking specifically for something involving either **Wattson**, **Mirage**, **Wraith, Octane** or **Lifeline.** I'm a fan of both in-game and AU ideas as long as your ok with me still learning how to do fight scenes. I'm REALLY keen on finding a Mirage to my Wattson, or someone to pair with Gib!\n\nFourth is **My Hero Academia**, and like my previous post, I'm looking for AU's! One idea I've come across is of Class 1-A graduating and becoming heros, only to learn later down the line as pros that the system isn't all its cracked up to be, and some ditch the public eye to becoming vigilantes (And before you ask, I haven't had the chance to read the spin-off of the same name, but definitely will be!) I've also seen Battle Royale versions of this and would *love* to work off that. I'm pretty much up for anything when it comes to this series right now!\n\nFifth is **Persona 5,** and I'm huge into AU's for this series. I've seen anything between mafia/yakuza to pirates and princesses, so I'd love to talk more about this with someone. We could do post P5R events, or a separate path/scenario, or even something a bit darker that's set in a modern world. I'm a huge fan of really big and really loud Phantom Thieves, maybe something similar to a GTA style heist, with planning, getting ready, the heist itself and the days following.\n\nWhen it comes to **Overwatch**, I'm a huge fan of the series and I'm ready to try out your ideas! I've been an active player since it release, and I've been following the lore for years. Wanna do something before the fall? Maybe focus on the mysterious teams like Blackwatch or even Talon?\n\nWhen it comes to **F/F** ideas, I have only a handful I wanted to try out! These all range from two individuals meeting over the summer and bonding (Think Fried Green Tomatoes era), two actresses competing for a role in a big breakout film (This can lean between modern and a more classic Hollywood setting!), two women meeting in unlikely circumstances and having to team up (This can be just about anything, I'd love to chat more about it!) and a more specific one, a pair of female wrestlers who're enemies in the ring but start to form a bond over time and while travelling around the world (This one will mainly be focusing on things like in-ring drama with a side of personal issues as well.)\n\nFor series AU'S, I would love to do any of the following;\n\n**Hollywood AU -** Something similar to the Netflix show of the same name, or something set in a 40's-60's Hollywood era. Maybe one character is the American Sweetheart type of person but can\u2019t sing or act, while the other is incredible at their craft, but is too wild and carefree to apply themselves to it?\n\n**Battle Royale/Hunger Games AU** \\- I **love** characters fighting to the death, or being pitted against each other with heavy doses of drama in between. If you don't mind having some fan favorites going at each other for survival, I'm the girl to get in contact with!\n\n**AI and Human** \\- Enough said! Just looking for some space/futuristic stuff where an AI and human are friends, but relationships continue to grow\n\n**Fallout/Apocalypse/Zombie AU** \\- I would love to have characters travel across New Vegas or zombies eating at each other!\n\n**Darker ideas/Horror and drama** \\- I live for darker ideas (with a few exceptions), especially in the horror categories!\n\n**Just normal AUs** \\- Bring on your coffee shop au's and your florist/tattoo shop ideas!\n\nWith all of this being said, please, PLEASE don't contact me if you plan on starting off with \"hey i wanna do a \\_\\_\\_ roleplay\" and then proceed to lead me in circles with \"Idk\" or \"Whatever you want\". Come to me with ideas beforehand! Give me some enthusiasm! I've had plenty of partners that start off fantastic, only to lose touch three messages into planning, or will suddenly go AFK. I don't mind if you need to take some time off, or even if you wish to stick to OOC and idea sharing, but it's so disappointing to start a roleplay only to have the other person drop out with no reason why. If we haven't roleplayed in a while and you wish to continue, a surprise post from a dead thread is my favorite!\n\nIf any of the above interest you, please PM/DM me for more information! Thanks!",
