            "selftext": "*Fantasy has always been set in the world of swords and horses, but ever wondered what that world would be like if it was set in the modern world? A modern world of technology with Elves, Orcs, Dwarves, Trolls, Goblins, and of course, humans--all living together in one world with multiple societies of civilization. Imagine New York City being inhabited by humans, orcs, goblins, and elves alike. Magic is seen as a gift to society and only seeks to expand technology together.*  \n\n\n*Wars are fought with modern weapons, but combining magic with these weapons offers an advantage in battles that have been fought and won. Think Zootopia, but with all the classic fantasy races.*  \n\n\n**My character is a nerdy Elf, an excitable genius who lives in the melting pot of New York City. With his excitement for learning and magic, he has followed that path to become a senior researcher at Frostfire Industries, and a Doctor of Magical Theory.**  \n\n\n**What I'm Looking for:** This could easily be a slice of life RP that offers and interesting dynamic in that it is set in a modern classic fantasy setting. I have mostly paired him with stronger personality characters as it tends to offer an awesome dynamic to counter his weaker and more excitable personality. \n\nIf you enjoy a bit of world building and love writing action, romance, and adventure, then this is the story for you! I am open to all sorts ideas, so if you have a different dynamic, please feel free to hit me up with it! Thanks for reading.\n\n# About me\n\n* I am a 23 yr old male (**I don't RP with people below the age of 18 due to the mature themes**).\n* I am in the EST timezone.\n* **I prefer a partner who can reply multiple times a day** or at least chat to let me know you're still interested and usually if there is a long space without a post, I lose interest. I totally get life gets in the way sometimes as well!\n* I prefer for my partner to be literate and contributing to the story as well (Plotting, having their character be a character of action, etc).\n* I am a Police Officer on night shift, so sometimes my time gets very limited (not that other jobs don't) since I work about from 5 to 6 to 7 days a week, not including doubles I sometimes pull.\n* I prefer romance to be a part of the story, but if you don't want it to be, that's totally fine, just let me know beforehand.\n* I like to talk in OOC and plot a lot, so please let me know if you don't want to.\n* I like a lot of drama in my RPs since I feel it keeps the story interesting.\n* I would prefer to RP on discord, but if you have an option you would like to try, I am totally fine with that.\n* I'm pretty easy going, so if you have more to add to the plot or the basic narrative I typed above, please don't hesitate to let me know.\n* I try to keep my posts around 1 - 3 paragraphs, but I can definitely post more if it warrants it.\n* If you've read the entire post, please shoot me a PM with your favorite color otherwise I won't respond.\n* I like to post music with my posts sometimes if I feel there is a need for a dramatic feel in a post. If you don't like that, please let me know beforehand.\n* If this at all interests you, please feel free to shoot me a PM and I will shoot my discord over to you!",

            "selftext": "Inspired by Red Dead (or taking place in its universe, depending on your preference), here\u2019s an Old West prompt that I\u2019ve cleaned up yet AGAIN. Set vaguely sometime in the 1800s, tonally it can be considered the slow kindling of a friendship (and, eventually romance), but I\u2019m definitely not married to the idea. Aside from the very basic setup in the prompt, go buck wild\u2014 for lack of a better cowboy term.\n\nWe can talk very little outside of the roleplay, become friends, do the whole Pinterest board/playlist deal, etc. I\u2019m very much flexible in that sense, so I\u2019d be happy to match your level of enthusiasm :) \n\nI will say that, for the time being, smut probably won\u2019t be roleplayed out\u2014 I\u2019ve been burned one too many times by people buttering me up only to live out their sexual fantasies vicariously through myself or the roleplay. It makes me profoundly uncomfortable and for that reason, sexual content can be referred to but never explicitly roleplayed in order to deter these exact kind of folks. \nI\u2019d be largely interested in someone matching my level of literacy, as I can go anywhere from literate to novella length. Other than my two specifications, really, I\u2019m very much interested in hearing what y\u2019all have to bring to the table! PM and/or chat if interested with a brief little blurb about your name, age, and anything you want to say about yourself or the roleplay! Ideas or vague gists as to what direction you\u2019d like to take are greatly appreciated too, but definitely unnecessary. \n\nApologies in advance for formatting as I\u2019m on mobile (:\n\n\n. . . . . . . \n\n\n\nWinnifred woke with a start; clammy, and gasping for air that, seemingly, wasn't there.\n\nWhen she got her bearings, and realized there was nothing to be afraid of except for the phantoms in her dreams, she heaved a groan and rubbed at her face. From the corner of her bedroom, an incessant lip-smacking could be heard. Her brow twitches, and soon Winona's on her feet. \"I got it abuelo, ya voy.\" She mutters, exasperation edging itself into her tone. She hears his grunts of protest again, and she scowls, but otherwise wordlessly drags her feet without much gripe to the washroom, scooping a handful of water from the basin before rubbing the weariness from her face.\n\nThe expression that gazes back at her in the mirror tells her that it didn't entirely work.\n\nShe blinks once, twice at her reflection, gives it a derisive snort, and stalks off to fetch her enfeebled grandfather some water.\n\nBefore the haggard woman that gazed back at her, there was some woman else. (Or girl, at the insistence of her grandfather, but she\u2019s been many a kind of woman before she was this one, none of which she cares to remember or is particularly fond of). That woman now made her livelihood selling and buying horses in Serpent\u2019s Creek. A humble profession if any, but it was secure, and it was mindless, and it was lonely; frankly, she couldn\u2019t have asked for more.\n\nHer homestead was desolate and arid, but it was also free. She reckons it must\u2019ve been abandoned by some family or other because it was horrendously decrepit when she came upon it. It was nothing a bit of elbow grease couldn\u2019t fix, and though the house was largely vacant and ugly it was hers, which was more than she could\u2019ve said for herself at any other point. In it, she could live quietly and insignificantly; perhaps that wasn\u2019t what she wanted, but it was sorely what she needed. Her days bled into the next in a mind-numbing blur, and when she thought enough about it the fact would madden her a little, but her work makes it easy to stifle her thoughts.\n\nThe horses were demanding, and her grandfather even more so. He was half deaf and blind in one eye; Winnifred would even go so far as to say he\u2019s mute for his propensity to go days at a time without a word. Even so, he was a robust man for someone who's face was enveloped in thick wrinkles and whose knuckles were swollen to size of walnuts.\n\nWhen the sky is finally red she helps her old man amble into the kitchen and sits him there, mashing a closed fist into her other hand. One of the first signs they had established together, that particular one had meant Winnifred was mashing potatoes for his dinner. He seemed unhappy about it, but Winnifred was too impatient and too tired to find a way to articulate to him that he couldn\u2019t eat much of anything else on account of his rotting teeth, outside of bellowing at him several times.\n\nShe steals a glance at him and finds his expression, ridden with disapproval, doesn't change. Winnifred knows him well enough to know that he wasn\u2019t kicking up a fuss about his choice of dinner any longer.\n\n\u201cI don't remember how to say it in Navajo.\" She makes it a point to face him so that his eyes could parse what his ears could not.\n\nEven when she turns around she could feel his disapproving gaze through his cloudy, glassy eyes. \"I don't!\" She insists, her brows knitting at the vaguely amused smile on his weathered face.\n\nShe turns her head to conceal her own, and thereafter serves him and has her own dinner in quiet silence. Then, she heaves him up stairs, settling him into bed and herself into a chair, trying this time to remain awake until he has fallen asleep to retire to her own bedroom.\n\nShe ends up falling asleep in that very chair, lulled by the crickets and the dullard sound of her grandfather\u2019s snoring.\n\nThey chirp.\n\nAnd chirp.\n\nHe snores, and they chirp.\n\nThe rhythm is wonderfully familiar, a quiet little lullaby, at least until the resounding crash heard from below them rouses her. She snaps up and looks to her grandfather, even he being stirred by the commotion below. His expression is somber, and steely-- this was no dream of hers.\n\nHer eyes scan the room, until they settle upon the rifle leaning against the foot of the bed. She's quick to take it up, and immediately emerges out into the hall and thunders down the stairs, trailing the gun's sights onto the black mass on the floor of her kitchen. Sweat pricks at her philtrum and hairs stand at the end of her neck. Her knuckles strain with how forcefully she grips the rifle; skilled, but alerted.\n\nFor a fleeting moment she believes it to be some coyote or other critter, but instead finds an injured man, of all things. A gravely injured man, at that.\n\nShe's left speechless for quite sometime, blinking down at him stupidly a moment but nevertheless steels her nerves and readies her gun, setting the butt of it square against her shoulder.\n\n\u201cWhat's your name? Who sent you?\"\n\nShe's breathing hard and fast now, and for a split second debates lowering her gun. She adjusts her grip instead, voice hoarse from sleep.\n\n\"You got weapons on you?\"",

I might not always get everything right but for the   most part I do. I try to aim between two to three paragraphs a reply   unless I feel the situation calls for more. In which case I will give   more.\n\nThing 2. I\u2019m very detail   orientated. I try my best to describe things in an all-encompassing sort   of way and think that in doing so it brings about a greater story.\n\nThing 3. My replies are sporadic but if I\u2019m into a story I tend to reply more.\n\nThing   4. The biggest thing for me is communication and not doing the aptly   named \u201cghosting\u201d. There is nothing more annoying than starting a story,   giving my time, and being ghosted. It\u2019s quite honestly the most   disrespectful thing you can do to a fellow writer. If you think you   might ghost or something please do not message me and save us the time.\n\nThing   5. I am interested in adult themes and content. We can talk more about   what that means but that does mean within the romance between the two   characters as well.  \n\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \n\n\nToday! I\u2019m looking for something involving Richard Grayson and Kori from the DC world. Starfire and Nightwing are a favorite couple of mine and one that I\u2019m interested in exploring in a year one setting. IE her coming to Earth or her already having been on Earth for a while. I\u2019ll have Richard Grayson as his nightwing persona as well. Of course will all characters being aged up. \n\nI do want to preface one thing. While I understand a lot of people know her best from her Teen Titans cartoon I am not the hugest fan of that version. I don\u2019t mind doing a mix of that personality and her more comic book persona but I am \u201cmostly\u201d looking for her to lean into her classic more sultry persona from the comics. We can talk about what that means (as I\u2019m not interested in \u201ctelling\u201d someone how to play their character). I suppose I would like to say that I\u2019m looking for a powerful version of the character. \n\nIf interested please reach out! I\u2019d love to talk more.",

            "selftext": "Hey,\n\nI am back here looking for literate partners whom I could roleplay with. I have two plots that I wish to roleplay with but I am completely open to listening in to your suggestions on my plots, your own ideas and anything you want to try.\n\nYou might have seen similar plots and the reason why I am posting from a new account is that I forgot the password to my old account and decided to start again! \n\nI am 21 years old and will not roleplay with minors. Also, I am okay with a few NSFW elements in the plot and we can further discuss that when you reach out to me.\n\nAs for the Original Plots that I want to share- I have a few. They are extremely different from one another but there is a lot that can be done with the plot. I will also mention the fandoms I am in so that we can come up with fandom based plots for the roleplay as well. \n\n______________________________________\nMy Plots:\n\nPlot 1: Falling for Best Friend's Brother\n\nBelle (my character) is clumsy, socially awkward and nerdy girl. She is jumpy and energetic all the time and extremely addicted to game arcades. She doesn't have many friends except one- Luke. They had been best friends since the past 12 years and are still the same in high school. \n\nSteve (your Character) is the polar opposite of Belle. He's popular, charming, witty, sarcastic and the captain of the basketball team. He tends to get into fights and often looses his temper over things. He's 6\"2 and has an athletic body. He has girls swoon over him every time he walks the corridors of Greenwood High. Steve also happens to be the elder brother of Luke. Steve leaves no stone unturned when ot comes to provoking Belle or teasing her. Belle does think he's cute but Steve is known for having his fair share of flings around campus (having a girl wrapped around him every 3 months). \n\nBut One of the major deal-breakers of Belle's friendship with Luke was that his Brother is off limits. And Belle maintained that rule all her life but how long will she be able to do that?\n\nPlot 2: Opposites Attract.\n\nNate the character that you will play is a little narcissistic and superficial. He's tall, popular and has a temper issue.He is sculpted by God. He has been in a long relationship with Maddi, who is very bipolar and toxic. But he is no less. He used to think that Maddy was it for him. \n\nHe didn't have tattoos neither does he rebel by Breaking rules. He has the perfect grades and the perfect everything yet people fear him for once you're not on his good side, it's terrible to be on his bad side.\n\nEnter Belle. She is the polar opposite of Nate. She only knows Nate because of sharing a few classes with him but doesn't get in his way at all. She loves baking, cooking and dancing. She is bubbly. But there is one thing that she hides. She had been falling for Nate and everything he went to Maddy, he'd break her heart. She pretends to not react much to it by over indulging herself in other things and activities.\n\nBut when Nate gets to know of Belle's little crush, he starts pining for Belle and they have a small fling which is nothing official. He keeps going back to Maddy and that complicates the relationship between Belle and Nate.\n\nARRANGED MARRIAGE PLOT:\nThis is set in a timeline (we can choose that together). Chris/Steve is commander in general or an army colonel. He is a free spirited man and in love with a nurse who had saved his life in the trenches. But his father had promised his bestfriend that he'd marry their children. My characters' father is not rich unlike Steve/Chris's family so this marriage is what he needs to keep his other children alive. The wedding takes place but my character has a difficult time dealing with the expectations of his family (who judge my character for her choices) and dealing with Steve/Chris himself. But she know that she has to make this work.\n\n_______________________________________________\n\nThese are some detailed plots that I would LOVE to play with anyone who is up for it. I love slow burn romances, unrequited love, drama and the likes of all that is very extra haha.\n\nI am obviously open to any suggestions or even creating a new plot with you! I hope to get some responses and I look forward to talking to you soon. xxx",

            "selftext": "Greetings fellow redditor!\n\nWith the current state of the world, and recent exposure at my job, I\u2019m going a little stir crazy. So I am looking for someone who is interested in writing a few times a day. (I understand sometimes stuff happens and it\u2019s not as much as other days).  RP and collaboration writing is a lovely escape for me and I\u2019d like to find someone who is the same. \n\nGMs welcome to come and use this space together to hone and practice your skills. \n\nIdeas:\nTwo friends, who\u2019s daily ritual is watching the sunrise witness the sun disappear from the sky. Few people witnessed the event, therefore it is deemed necessary they set out to help find an answer. Learning that they both posses more than they originally realized, the pair set forth to bring back the sun to their skies. (High fantasy/adventure)\n\nThe world of Victorian England is one filled with propriety, rules and etiquette. Myra is exceedingly talented in following these rules and delivering these expectations, however, she cannot help but yearn for adventure. When an opportunity arise for her to visit her brother while he studies abroad in Italy is one she cannot pass up. In the city of Venice she finds more than she ever bargained for and neither her heart or she herself are entirely safe here. (Historical/romance/intrigue)\n\nA young lady, posing as a cabin boy secrets herself aboard a navy ship during the height of the Golden Age of piracy (1770s). A pirate ship intercepts the vessel and an even bigger adventure than originally planned unfolds before her very eyes. (Swashbuckling/supernatural/adventure/possible romance)\n\nI am also open to other ideas!\n\n\nMy stats:\n\nFemale 21+ looking for a 18+ partner. \n\nSpelling and grammar aren\u2019t being graded but an effort is made and required. \n\nCST\n\nNo one line replies\n\nDiscord only\n\n3rd person writing style \n\n...\n\nOOC chat kept separate but still welcome :)\n\nIf this sounds fun shoot me an orange envelope and let\u2019s see if we click!\n\nTake care!",

            "selftext": "Searching for someone 21+ interested in writing a main male character (and maybe other supporting side characters) interested in a modern, slice-of-life kind of RP. Some slow-burn, romance, angst, and perhaps darker, heavy themes incorporated (addiction, mental health, etc.) Preferring F/M couples right now, but may be swayed for F/F under the right circumstances. Smut is fine too, but I prefer a good bit of storyline built up to it, and it not to be the main focus of the story. \n\nI prefer detailed, literate writing and my post lengths usually fall in the 3-5 paragraph range. Writing style is third person, past tense, and I kind of hope for the same from my partner. OOC chatter and plot building is also super important, I like to get a feel for where the story is going with my partner instead of just randomly jumping into scenes. Real character references/face claims/play bys only, please. No anime/drawn characters. I prefer discord as a platform, but might consider GDocs, provided there is an easy way for OOC chat. \n\nIf you're interested in cooking up some drama, please DM me to chat a bit and to exchange discord names. Please tell me your favorite color somewhere in the message so I know you've read my entire ad. If you have previously messaged me about RP and I haven't responded, feel free to try again!

            "selftext": " The year is 2030. The world itself has gone through a lot of changes throughout the decade. The coronavirus pandemic of 2020 only lasted a year and a half after appearing in January of that year. Afterward, the world went into full motion, as the general population went to work. In the United States, a lot of technological advances were made. It was a boom that rivaled the Industrial and the Cold War Era in terms of scientific discoveries and economic changes.\n\nOne scientific phenomenon that was widely observed around the world was the change in biological creatures. While minuscule, many scientists have noted a rapid growth of creatures in terms of size around the world. They attribute this growth to the icebergs in both of the poles rapidly melting, releasing a lot of oxygen into the world. This change has seen an increase in fuel efficiency and better plant growth, most notably in places such as the Amazon Forest, Xishuangbanna Tropical Rainforest, Sundarbans, and the Congo Basin Rainforests.\n\nIn fact, videos have been circulating on the web of small birds being trapped in large webs before being mercilessly consumed whole or in large chunks by spiders. It\u2019s jarring, to say the least.\n\nThis brings us to July 21st, 2030. Workers are taking their lunch break at local restaurants, mothers are walking their children around the park for some exercise, joggers are drowning in sweat, and nobody has single care in the world. Many hear the loud, echos of buzzing that emanate the city. \u201cHelicopters,\u201d many think as they glance up at the sky, unbothered but more curious than anything.\n\nIt isn\u2019t until the shrill screaming of a woman that alerts many around the world. Many run for their lives, but unable to make it far as their abdomens are pierced by the ruthless wasps, while others are frozen in fear, easily massacred by their flying overlords. Nobody could\u2019ve predicted that today would\u2019ve been the end of the world.\n\n*So, there we go! Howdy folks, I\u2019ve been wanting to do this type of roleplay for a while now. I wish I came up with this idea myself -- it\u2019s 100% not mine! The idea comes from a Webcomic called \u201cHIVE,\u201d which has a really similar plot. The only difference is that it takes place in South Korea, while this plot takes place in New York City.*\n\n*This is not a group RP. This will just be one on one. That's it. I stated in my previous post that I wanted to make this a group thing. But, I haven't roleplayed in a fair amount of time and so I want to get back into the groove of things.*\n\n*Just a general note, I would like to keep this as realistic as possible. Odds are, people in Manhattan don\u2019t have enough weapons to supply the entire United States military. In fact, I imagine Rambo having a difficult time looking for weapons outside of NYPD precincts.*\n\n*Mature, ideally 20+, East Coast? Not too picky on gender, probably won\u2019t lean on the whole romance thing, but who knows? Shoot me a message and we\u2019ll see!*",

            "selftext": "Hey I\u2019m Zee. I\u2019m 22. PST time zone. I\u2019ve been writing for 5+ years, and discord is my preferred platform. I write third person, novella style (multi-paragraph). I am flexible in length though, I\u2019ll always do my best to match what my partner is writing and I understand that different situations in writing require different lengths in response (quality over quantity). However having said that, I prefer that most responses be a 2-3 paragraph minimum to give me something to work with. \n\nI\u2019m looking for a writing partner to dive in with me into this mafia-style world I\u2019ve created. It takes place in modern-day and a lot of twisting and winding plots and complex characters. I\u2019ve spent a lot of time over the years creating these characters and this city and I would love to share it with someone. I\u2019m looking for a partner who\u2019s willing to learn about this world I\u2019ve created and play multiple characters. I\u2019d also be playing multiple characters, most of them female. My partner would be playing mostly male characters, including, if they\u2019re comfortable, a couple villains/antagonists as well (although in a world like this there\u2019s not a lot of heroes). Romance, crime, action, and mystery will be the most prevalent themes. I will explain more about the plot and the characters once we start talking in private messages (simply because it\u2019s a lot of text and I didn\u2019t want to overwhelm this ad with a really lengthy message). If you\u2019re interested I will be more than happy to give you the full plot details and character descriptions. For now, the basic outline of the plot is that there are three crime families on the brink of war and when alliances are starting to be made, secrets start coming out and unraveling everything. The idea is that every character has a secret of sorts or a hidden motivation. Now I don\u2019t know the specifics of where this plot would go. I would like it to be something we decide together. I know this is a world of my own making but I really will do my best to include you and make it feel like your own as well. \n\nNow, why is this post marked NSFW? Well, I\u2019m asking to write in a mafia-style world and mafia worlds are rated PG. I am willing to work with comfort levels, especially around romance, but there will definitely be violence. Because of that, I will only write with people +18. If you decide to message me about interest please also include your age! This is non-negotiable.   \nSo that\u2019s it! If you are interested or have questions please message me!",

            "selftext": " \n\ni saw this painting called \u201cthe wedding\u201d, and it was of this woman in a wedding dress cowered to the ground with her face buried in her hands. an elderly man, who i can only presume to be her father, is next to her looking down at her with an expression that\u2019s somehow contentious and sympathetic at the same time. a handmaiden peeks around the corner from the door behind them.\n\nidk why but this completely fictional narrative that i projected onto this painting grabbed me and shook me like a ragdoll. that being said there\u2019s a lot of gaps that im hoping your creativities could fill!\n\nso, this is definitely a period piece, but what period exactly I couldn\u2019t say? i would say anywhere from little women (so mid 1800s) to pride and prejudice (late 18th century/regency era) though id probably err more toward the latter. the gist of it is that this is a time where this is largely heretical or at the very least, unconventional to be a female artist. magdalena is prone to mood swings, melodrama, being suspiciously bisexual, and an incredible inability to hold her liquor, so aside from artistry she fits the definition pretty well.\n\naside from a character study and a slow burn, it\u2019s also an inspection on gender roles for the time! for that particular reason im requested a male character counterpart. i think it would make a nice juxtaposition given the subject of her art, which largely deals with the plight and suffering inherent to womanhood and gender roles of the time. of course, over the course of the rp depending on how her personality is influenced, the subject of her art might change, but womanhood overall is a HUGE theme in her work.\n\ndefinitely not a smut rp but she is pretty promiscuous for what the time period would allow, so while this isn\u2019t smut focused (I\u2019ve been burned one too many times by people fishing for it, so it won\u2019t be something written out in detail) there will probably be references to more racy things.\n\nas for who your character is\u2014 anyone! a fellow artist, an art critic, a patron of the arts, a butler, a soldier, a curator, etc. any and all manner of folk are welcome since the prompt begins at a soir\u00e9e thing that\u2019s subject to the scandal of displaying her work.\n\nim definitely someone who can match your level of enthusiasm in terms of roleplay, so whether you want to talk shop and make Pinterest boards or keep chatting to a minimum and jump right in, im your gal. PM and/or chat if interested with name, age, anything else you want to tell me about yourself and potential ideas/thoughts about the roleplay and it\u2019s direction (though that last one isn\u2019t necessary). from there we can use email, discord, or google docs. \n\nhappy reading y'all!\n\n. . .\n\n\u201cMiss Waithe\u2014 Miss Waithe, my dear.\u201d\n\nMagdalena perks up at the second, more impatient clarion call of her name and sets down an hors d'oeuvre, taking a slight caper toward the matron who beckoned her. Much to her chagrin her grandfather lingered near, meaning she had to behave; though he wasn\u2019t much less lecherous or sardonic than herself\u2014 only wizened with age and, quite frankly, tired of the trifles of youth and society.\n\n\u201cThis painting it\u2019s... erm, how shall I put it?\u201d\n\n\u201cBeautifully composed? Poetic? Invoking, perhaps?\u201d Magdalena suggests, her excitement mounting with every word. Her brows arch upward and her smile seems to crease further with anticipation.\n\nLady Colepepper, the matron in question, fumbles in the wake of Magdalena\u2019s rapid-fire response. She collects herself with a sniff and a sniff and, in as gentle a manner as possible, tries to opine on the nature of Magdalena\u2019s painting without offending her cantankerous sensibilities. \u201cIt\u2019s... erm, troubling. My dear, it\u2019s troubling.\u201d\n\nMagdalena doesn\u2019t seemed perturbed by the commentary, her smile staying as radiant as it had been previously, if not a little forced. Considering the subject was cowering in abject misery, Magdalena thought it to be an asinine and self-evident form of commentary. An idiot, if she\u2019s ever seen one.\n\n\u201cWhy, yes it is. What an astute observation,\u201d The sarcasm just barely passes over Lady Colepepper\u2019s head. Her grandfather gives her a steely, warning glower. Magdalena is quick to redress her behavior.\n\n\u201cThe subject is troubled, indeed. And I hope to evoke that sentiment in its viewer as well. Is something the matter? I should like to hear it from one with such a keen, artistic eye such as yourself.\u201d\n\nLady Colepepper bristles at the praise. Her sarcasm was quickly erring into territory that was brazenly offensive, but the lady in question presses forth anyhow.\n\n\u201cWell, the subject\u2014 she is upset.\u201d\n\n\u201cMmhm.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s upset and... cowering in the tulle of her wedding dress.\u201d\n\n\u201cRightly so.\u201d She affirms.\n\nLady Colepepper stammers over her words. Magdalena squares her shoulders, readily prepares to defend her expression doggedly. Her grandfather pointedly watches her from afar.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d She lets out an incredulous chuckle. \u201cIt seems as though she\u2019s upset she\u2019s getting married.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s correct.\u201d\n\nMagdalena is blinked at stupidly, to which she looks from the painting, to Colepepper, to the painting again. She never composed to offend, rather to enlighten, but Magdalena has to admit to herself that she practically blooms with pride when she offends sensibilities impossible to explain. She\u2019s done this song and dance before; now comes the debate of the painting in question.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2014 preposterous! It completely lacks any... devotion. Any virtue.\u201d Lady Colepepper moda her head at her own words, satisfied with her derision. A man standing not a few feet away but witness to the conversation\u2014 her son, Boulter\u2014 now joins with thoroughly unhelpful commentary.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s invirtuous!\u201d He supplies. Magdalena is not entirely certain if that was even a word, but it mattered little when she was so righteously offended.\n\n\u201cAnd I think it\u2019s decidedly invirtuous of you to call me over for you to insult my painting. But I haven\u2019t cried heresy, have I?\u201d Magdalena flicks her fan open, flapping it at herself flippantly. The Colepeppers\u2019 cheeks prickle with an iresome red and Magdalena\u2019s jaw squares in response; it is then that her grandfather, Auguste Fautre, intervenes.\n\n\u201cMy ladies\u2014 er, and gentleman. I\u2019m certain that\u2014\u201c\n\n\u201cNo no, pep\u00e9re, please, sit down. I have this under control. in fact\u2014 You there!\u201d She can\u2019t see the man\u2019s face from behind, thus resulting in the informality that turned the head of many.\n\nOnce he turns, Magdalena beckons him over with her fan. At his arrival, Magdalena turns to her combatants as though she were going to make an argument so resounding, so quashing, they would have no choice but to wallow in their offense.\n\n\u201cSir, if you and I were to be wed\u2014\u201c\n\n\u201cMagdalena-Patience, I do not think\u2014\u201c\n\nMagdalena gives a dismissive wave of her fan toward her grandfather, hushing him. The Colepeppers, meanwhile, stewed in their utter surprise at her derision. \u201cHush, grandfather. If you and I were to be wed, and I didn\u2019t wish to marry you\u2014 would you marry me?\u201d\n\nHer grandfather gives a pained groan, muttering pleas of patience and prayer in his native tongue as he pinched the bridge of his nose. He hardly even knows where to begin. \u201cAnd why did you insist on inserting yourself in the narrative?\u201d He asks, staring pointedly at his granddaughter for an answer.\n\n\u201cBecause,\u201d She replies haughtily. \u201cUnlike my painting, I am very much real. It\u2019s a lot easier to wane to the ministries of a painting, where man is God. She has a story, a plight, but she\u2019s little else than that. She has no tears to weep, no thoughts to opine. A person can voice these things, their... abject terror. It\u2019s a lot harder to defend oneself from their ministrations when you are of flesh and blood.\u201d\n\nMagdalena addresses the man once more, beaming up at him as though she knows she\u2019s won. All she needs is his affirmation\u2014 if he\u2019s willing to lend it, of course.",

They were normally treated no different than someone with a different skin color, with some racism but nothing too disastrous. Sometimes certain races would accel at certain jobs and be held to a standard, but of course, stereotypes were often true for most. Interracial relationships were uncommon, but not rare, which brings us to our story. Simply put, this is a love story between two people. A non-human man and a non-human girl. How it starts and how it goes is up to us. Who we meet along the way could be absolutely anyone.

I've been roleplaying on and off for about 12 years. I'm semi to advanced literate, depending on the plot, the scene and my partner. I write mostly in 3rd person, I'm comfortable with adult themes and discord is my preferred platform for roleplaying. My schedule fluctuates, but I always try to get at least one reply out a day (but it's usually a lot more haha).\n\nI want to do a medieval arranged marriage roleplay. Perhaps our characters are from rival nations, maybe they're different fantasy races. We can do something more domestic or something adventurous, lighthearted and sweet or dark and dangerous. Whatever we decide, I would like there to be a romance element to the story. \n\nSend me a message, rather than a chat, with your ideas!",

I have 7 years experience roleplaying and have been doing scenes as Catra since not long after season 1 came out! I\u2019m looking for someone who has some experience (doesn\u2019t have to be as Adora, just experience roleplaying) and can write at least a paragraph or more! I can write a lot once I get into it, but I\u2019ll always try and match your length.\n\nAs for plot, I don\u2019t mind. We can start where the end left off going into space, or we can explore life together and how Catra would settle into Brightmoon. We could also scrap the ending and go from after the portal- tension will be high between the two after that of course.\n\nJust let me know and we can discuss!!",

I have an Oc that I am currently developing and would love to finally try out my character. I have no drawings, so a description would be provided if that\u2019s okay. \n\nI\u2019m still not sure what the plot would be although I am more than happy to make one up together! I think I prefer if it can take place after Hogwarts where our characters are already grown up and maybe reminisce about school life? We can discuss our characters and plot in pms. \n\nThere will be no romance between the main characters. I am 20 so a partner who is 18+ would be great! I often times write about 1-3 paragraphs but I am all for quality over quantity. I tend to get busy from time to time so please be patient, I will reply whenever I can and don\u2019t be afraid to message me if I fail to do so.\n\nPlease have discord, I prefer discord to roleplay on. I hope this interest you if so please pm me! \n\nP.S. I am not an expert of the wizarding world and I won\u2019t mind it if you correct me on some things that I might get wrong. Also I don\u2019t mind ooc chat, it\u2019s be nice to have a lovely convo here and there. :)",

I'm open to any women, any age 18+, with hopefully the same sense and type of rp language... example being (using parentheses for OOC), \"Quotations for Dialogue\" and either plain text or *using asktrics for actions*.\n\nI am single IRL if that matters.\n\nThings I do:\n\nI roleplay first person, I use 2 apps primarily, Reddit not being one. \n\nI do like to jump right into a more vanilla relationship that builds over time to test the waters.\n\n--\n\nThings I would appreciate hearing from you:\n\nYour perspective (1st, 3rd), and how you would like to communicate moving forward.\n\nWhat platform will you communicate on?\n\nAre you in an IRL relationship or have kids?\n\nIf you're interested PM me.

            "selftext": "\"It\u2019s been 100 years since the new species of humans landed on Earth for the first time, but conflicts between both Earth Humans and the Outsiders haven\u2019t ceased. Some governments have surely appreciated the technology advances this contact brought, the new O-Humans were great scientists and researchers, their technology was a key to cure lots of potentially devastating diseases and virus like the one from 2020. Even so, the normal E-Humans citizens, the ones just like you, had a growing hatred towards the new species that took so many of their jobs, their homes, their planet, without a warning.\n\nThe feeling was now mutual, most O-Humans despised E-Humans as much as E-Humans despised O-humans. Their species had helped them so many times and they still treated them like criminals, like monsters! \u2018Earth Humans\u2019? Weren\u2019t they all Earth humans, now?\n\nThose who manage to live together in harmony, as friends, as families, as allies with the other species, are highly criticized by those of their kind, who call them traitors, who say they have no respect for their own people.\u00a0\n\nThe relationship between both species had been worse already, but there were still several gangs and groups of both species fighting each other in almost every country. They are rare, but special people on both sides try to maintain the world's balance and avoid civil wars hiding their own identity and species waiting for the day when they all live together in peace. They were called guardians, protectors, super heroes. At least by those who actually appreciated their help.\"\n\n\nIn this RP we will be roommates in a quite turbulent city. My character is one of the guardians and one of her most troubled\u00a0 battles will lead to your character find out her secret identity. Will you hand my character to the enemy? Will you help her? Will you ignore her? Will you save her? That's up to you.\n\nIf you liked the prologue maybe you're interested in being part of this story! If you didn't like the prologue I still hope you have a great day! If you skipped the prologue and went straight to the end you're making me sad!\n\nIf you're interested in this RP, please send me a message and I'll answer any question you have and explain some minor things about the plot.\n\nI hope you can write 1 to 4 (or more if the situation asks for it as long as it's not 4 pages describing your visit to the zoo) paragraphs (3rd person) and be able to control minor characters even though you have only one main. The RP will have action and slice of messed up lifes parts. It may have romance and a more developed sci fi theme if you are into it. And you can do whatever you want with it that I'll just roll with your ideas. Even if you say it was all a dream I'll accept it! (butpleasedon'tnoonelikesthat)",

            "selftext": "Hello! I'm a 27-year-old male writer who's always thought of storytelling as a solitary joy. Creating characters and building narratives for them is something I've always done by and for myself, but coming across this subreddit really made me want to dip my toes in the proverbial pool of collaborative writing! (I've found a partner or two who are truly excellent, but as I'm sure is the case for several of us, the circumstances of the pandemic have given me ample time for storytelling.) While I'm no stranger to weaving fiction, I'm still kind of a total newbie when it comes to RPing, so I'm hoping for prospective partners who are patient, enthusiastic, and have a playful, detailed sense of the craft! For the sake of not wanting to corner a collaborator into a one-sided plot, I don't have a concrete story idea to share, but instead, I'll offer up a list of story and character tropes I'm fond of in the hopes that you spot something you like! They're listed in order of preference, but, of course, I'd be happy to hear any ideas of your own as well!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;College settings, coquettish rivalries, rivalry to romance, troublemaker girl/straight-laced guy, prank battles, secret mutual crushes, rich girl/less financially well-off guy, fluffy romance (which probably goes without saying, haha).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf any of those tropes speak to you, or if you have story ideas of your own that you'd like to share, I'll be glad to read them! All I really ask for is writing partners who are eager to write more than just a couple of lines in their responses, are willing to collaborate in coming up with a fun scenario, and enjoy the character creation process as much as I do! Given my verbosity in replies (probably an Achilles heel, but most of my responses chart somewhere between 500 and 1,000 words), you can expect one or two a day, depending on your own rate as well. (Life happens!) Please also be at least 20 so we have some similarity, age-wise. And please send a message in lieu of a chat request, and if you've read this, finish the rhyme in my username as your subject line to ensure I see your response! I'll remove the flair from this post when I'm full up on writing pals. I hope to hear from some of you, and good luck in your writing endeavors, wherever they take you!",

Harry Potter is my favorite thing, and I'm hoping to find people who are equally as passionate and knowledgeable to write with. I'll keep this as brief as possible so we can start messaging each other about story/setting specifics.\n\nHere are my points:\n\n1. I'm open to M/M or M/F pairings. I'm capable of playing either M or F.\n2. I'm only interested in writing something that is set during the years/events of the books.\n3. We can follow the lore of the books or create an alternate story of our own (as long as it takes place within the years of the books).\n4. OC/OC is what I'd be most interested in writing. However, if you enjoy playing Hermione I'd love, love, love a Hermione/OC. Alternatively, I would be willing to play Hermione in a Hermione/OC story as well.\n\nI have been roleplaying for 15+ years and consider myself a very good writer. I love in depth and fleshed out characters, detailed writing, etc. Lastly, please be 18+ to write with me. If you're interested in discussing more, message me here so we can discuss details and exchange information.",

            "selftext": "Hiya, I am new to Reddit and thought I\u2019d try my luck at finding a RP partner here! I am 20 years old and I have been Roleplaying for 10 years now, but it has been a little while since my last one - so I may be a little rusty. \nI am looking for an 18+ partner to RP, I am open to NSFW scenes, but do not wish for them to be the sole purpose of the RP. \nI write in third person paragraphs, but am also open to asterisk posts. \nI am looking for an OC x Canon RP and would double up by playing a Canon for your OC.\n\nI have two potential plot ideas for the Roleplay (but am obviously open to suggestions and developing ideas with you) :\n\n1\u2022 Set in the Musical world of Hamilton (minus the singing unfortunately). I would like to use the contemporary dialogue of the musical, whilst still in relation to the historical plot. \n- The plot would start before or during the events of the play and would hopefully continue onto after. \nPotential Themes: \n\u2022 Relationships- I would like to explore both platonic and romantic relations between OCs and Canon characters (including revenge, lust, heartbreak, betrayal)\n\u2022 Female Role in a Patriarchal Society - (I will develop this in my OC profile). My character will be a female from a rich family in New York, who wishes to do more in life then marry a man. \n\u2022 Notion of Power/ Money/ Legacy - These are themes which are incredibly prevalent in the musical and would be key to the RP. \n\nCharacter Profile: \nAva Simmons\nA socialite, aged 20 at the beginning of the story.\nLarge, lustrous green eyes. Olive skin/ complexion. Long, wild and curly brown hair. Curvaceous figure. \nTends to have a cheeky/ arrogant facial expression, making people think she knows something which they do not. \nShe is charismatic, flirtatious and sees no issue with calling others out when she disagrees with them. Her boldness comes across as intimidating and unseemly for a \u2018lady\u2019. \nAva comes from an incredibly rich background, and so her father intent on her marrying into wealth very soon. Ava\u2019s priorities however are not wealth, nor marriage and she wishes to find a purpose greater than both. She is friends with the Schuyler Sisters, particularly Angelica, and would be present and most family affairs with them. \nShe would develop a relationship with Lafayette, despite to her father\u2019s disapproval. Their relationship would start out flirtatious, but with Ava initially rejecting his obvious advances. \nLikes:\nProving people wrong, socialising, being unconventional, shocking others, daydreaming about travelling.\n\n\n2\u2022 Set in the real world, with our OCs being part of the original cast/crew of Hamilton. The plot would begin at the initial cast read-through.\nPotential themes: \n- Struggles face by female artists in the performance industry.\n- Struggles faced by artists who are POC in the performance industry.\n- Notion of \u2018fame\u2019/ \u2018selling out\u2019 and how it effects friendships/ relationships.\n- Temptation that comes from success.\n\nCharacter Profile:\nAlessia De Luca\nA director/ close friend of Lin Manuel Miranda. \nAged 26 at the beginning of production.\nItalian, but born in England.\nLarge, lustrous green eyes. Olive skin/ complexion. Long, wild and curly brown hair. Curvaceous figure. Wears hippie clothing, eg flowy trousers and long floral skirts.\nSweet/ innocent disposition. \nVery relaxed and creative, but can be authoritative in a professional setting.\nRecently moved from England to the USA, so a bit out of her element in NYC.\nLoves to travel, and is a free spirit so she doesn\u2019t wish to be tied to a romantic relationship, but will fall for Daveed Diggs.\nLikes: Yoga, theatre, travel, dance, poetry and art.\n\nLike I said I\u2019m flexible with whatever plot/ storylines you\u2019d want to explore &amp; what platform you\u2019d like to use.\nDM if you\u2019re interested.",

            "selftext": "Hi there! We're delighted to invite you to /r/CenturyOfBlood, the newest iteration of our game, the successor to /r/ironthronepowers and /r/SevenKingdoms - in the lore of a Song of Ice and Fire.\n\n/r/CenturyofBlood is, as the name suggests, set in 77 AD, during the Century of Blood - a tumultuous period of time between the Doom of Valyria and the beginning of Aegon\u2019s Conquest. There is no one ruler of the Seven Kingdoms, with every region being independent - and, in addition to the normal regions, the smaller Kingdom of the Claw and Freehold of the Narrow Sea.\n\nAs you can see, this is an exciting and immersive game, for everyone and anyone to create stories and enjoy GRRM's magnificent world. There is something to be found for everyone in /r/CenturyofBlood, be it the wars and conquest that gave the Century of Blood the name it truly deserves, to exploration, of an old and very different Westeros, to an untamed and constantly changing Essos - romance, intrigue, adventure, brotherhood, and betrayal.\n\n\n---\n\n**The North**\n\nIn the north, the Starks rule as the Kings of Winter, with the current ruler being King Jorah Stark. King Jorah succeeded his father, King Brandon \u201cthe Bad\u201d, roughly seventeen years ago. King Brandon left the North scarred, burning the North fleet, and nearly drove his vassals to rebellion. King Jorah made many amends with these Lords, leaving them merely tired and exhausted rather than rebellious and angry.\n\nHowever, following Ironborn raids in 74 AD, the King of Winter, Jorah Stark, led a campaign of retribution against the Ironborn as his ancestor Theon Stark, the Hungry Wolf, had done to the Andals many years prior. This culminated in the siege of Depth's Lament, and the subsequent battles outside of it, in which scores of men - noble and lowborn - died on either side. The campaign ended in disaster, resulting in many Northern nobles, and the King of Winter himself being captured by the Ironborn. \n\nMany had been individually ransomed back, though another Ironborn raid plunged itself from the Saltspear right into the heart of the North, narrowly avoiding Northern response until finally it was cornered leaving the Saltspear by Perceon Manderly and the Western Fleet. The Ironborn won, though narrowly, losing many highborn sons and daughters in the process. Now, after the King and his imprisoned kinsmen have returned, an uneasy peace exists between the North and the Iron Isles - while tensions mount internally as many Houses still reel from the consequences of Depth's Lament. Will the North recover, or spiral into infighting and civil strife?\n\n**The Vale**\n\nThe young Queen of the Mountains and the Vale, Myranda I. Arryn, had successfully taken the reign of her Kingdom into her own hands, and arrangements for a spectacular royal wedding are in process. The region remains relatively peaceful and stable, although internal struggles are rising, both within families and between powerful vassals of House Arryn. The Mountain Clansmen need to be kept at bay, and adventure and danger await in the Mountains of the Moon. The Vale retains it's mostly isolationist nature, yet to be involved in any of the ongoing conflicts, preferring to keep to themselves, and further exploring the unique culture of the region.\n\n\n\n**The Riverlands**\n\nAfter the recent uprising of House Paege in the western Riverlands was crushed, the Ironborn invaders were driven back into the sea after the Hoare King was slain on the field of battle. Through the alliances forged by King Otho Bracken and Lord Royal Fredrick Darklyn with the Kingdom of the Reach and the new Valyrian Freehold war was narrowly avoided with the Stormlands with a show of unified strength at the Blackwater Bridge. Yet all is not well within the Riverlands. Raventree Hall sits under siege with bands of Blackwood soldiers pillaging the lands around them. And, in the east, the facade of stability which is the Dusklands slowly slips as bitter feuds simmer. Will King Otho restore peace to the west in time to turn his attention to the east to ease the growing tensions? Or will House Darry and House Darklyn continue to escalate tensions unhindered? These two houses posture against each other as House Darry forges alliances with the Claw, and House Darklyn prepares to wield their alliance with the Valyrians in response. Will there be civil war in the eastern Riverlands? Or perhaps a proxy war? Only time will tell, for this is the Century of Blood.\n\n**The Iron Islands**\n\nPrior to the beginning of the game, the Riverlanders, under the leadership of Ser Jon Fisher, rallied and threw off the yoke of the Iron King Harren the Black, casting him out of their lands. Harren was grievously wounded and some wondered if he would ever recover. When he did it was said foreign magicks were at work for the King seemed not himself half the time. Whispers and doubts spread and the Lords of the Isles began to make their moves in the shadows. \n\nHarren's attempt to retake the Riverlands changed everything. The Black King perished on the field outside Fairmarket, and now the question of who will take up the crown hangs in the balance. His heir apparent, Harras Hoare is little liked by most lords, some of whom favour Harren's firstborn, Sigur. There are others, such as Harald Greyjoy, who make plays for the throne, and now, it seems as if a Kingsmoot is inevitable. Aside from this, the Isles are coming to terms with the changing landscape of Westeros, Houses such as Harlaw are branching out to see what can be gained from more peaceable relations, but of course reavers still plague the shores from Bear Island to Oldtown. \n\nThe Iron Islands in this game feel truly unique from the rest of Westeros, from the beginning of development, fantastic work has been done to make the Isles feel culturally distinct in everything from the faith of the Drowned God to the language and terminology of the Ironborn.\n\n**The Westerlands**\n\nAt present, the Kingdom of the Rock sits quietly on the edge of emerging conflicts to the east and north. The Ironborn have not touched the western shores in some time, busy with their war against Winterfell and its domain, with the Harlaw of Harlaw going so far as to extend the olive branch to House Lannister after the peace-efforts of House Kenning of Kayce in the past few years. With a Princess of House Lannister now wed to the Hightower Heir, a friendship with Red Lake developing, and lingering bitterness with House Gardener over a rejected betrothal to Prince Perceon, relations with the Kingdom of the Reach remain uncertain, but peaceful. Equally uncertain are the Rock's relations with the fledgling Kingdom of the Trident, whose conflicts may soon embroil the Westerlands. Whether such involvement will bring plunder or hardship is yet to be seen.\n\n**The Reach**\n\nThe disappearance of the Crown Prince and the deteriorating health of the King has brought about uncertain times in the Reach. A largely unsuccessful search for Prince Perceon Gardener has now ended with him having returned safely to Highgarden on his own, but during his time away, many Reachlords have begun to question the Crown Prince's capabilities as a ruler. This has caused the council to split into two factions, who each hold a different vision for how the council and the High Kingdom should move forward. There's also the alliance being built with the Riverlanders, which has continued to move forward at the cost of many of the other neighbouring kingdoms being largely forgotten about by the Crown. This ties into the growing rivalry between Gardeners and Hightowers, with the latter refusing to pay all their taxes, turning down a royal marriage and accepting one with the Lannisters, and Gardener having responded by diverting trade away from Oldtown. Other than that, most people have been happily going to tourneys, balls and feasts and there's plenty of more personal drama going on between characters at those events (High school drama).\n\n**Stormlands**\n\nThe Stormlands are going through a tumultuous period, one that will either result in a revival of the kingdom or seal its fate into a continual decline. The last few decades have seen the Durrandon Kings ousted from The Kingdom of the Trident, as well as losing territory to the Kingdom of the Reach. The Durrandon Kings now plot for a return to their former glory, but difficulties meet them from all corners. To the south, the Dornish Marches keep their flame of hatred for the Principality of Dorne alive and burning strong. To the north are the martial families of the Bronzewood, and further afield the more shifty Houses of The Hook. Durrandon trusts the Bronzewood to remain firm, but can the same be said for the Masseys? The Bar Emmons? The constant courtship of Valyrians offering gifts and riches beyond their wildest dreams drive an ambition and greed. And of course, further north yet lies The Trident, ever a goal of the Durrandon dynasty. And finally, in the Storm\u2019s Seat, the core Houses of the Kingdom of the Storm plot behind vast walls. Durrandon, Connington, Swann, and Penrose form the backbone of the Kingdom, connecting each of the four other disparate sections together. To them, perhaps most of all, success of the Kingdom is vital. Should any one singular region revolt in discontent, it could spell the death knell for The Storm as a whole. After all, what is a Kingdom when the King has nothing to rule?\n\n**The Principality of Dorne**\n\nIn the last decade, Dorne has seen much tragedy and strife. A bloody war ignited in the Boneway, resulting in the deaths of many beloved men and leaving orphans and widows in its wake. Tensions run high between Princess Meria and King Arlan as their heirs clash, and their tensely agreed peace begins to fall apart. Fresh from ill-advised raids on each other's lands, the Marches burn slowly towards war, though neither is willing to break the peace set by the Faith. Amongst the houses in Dorne, plots and intrigue begin to rear their heads, and while Martell retains the loyalty of her vassals, the question of who will follow Meria is asked regularly.\n\n**The Dragonlords**\n\nThe Freehold of Blackwater Bay and the Narrow Sea is in the midst of the fourth year of Aerion Targaryen's rule. This year saw the birth of Rhaenys Targaryen, the fourth of his children. The Freehold celebrated the wedding of Aemidon Velaryon and Delia Darklyn, further strengthening their ties to the Dusklands. As war looms in the Trident, a company of Targaryen men under Jaevar Targaryen played a central role in the siege and battles of Fairmarket. After capturing Lord Edmund Blackwood, Alec Paege, and Peach Paege, Jaevar made a number of enemies amongst the other riverlords by removing the Paeges' heads after their house's forces attacked the besieging army. With Lord Edmund dying in his tent during the chaos of the battle, the Targaryen mercenaries are in the thick of the dissolution of the Trident's stability and House Bracken's increasingly bloody attempts to hold onto power.\n\n**The Claw**\n\nThe Claw has moved court to Hare Hall on the border to combat the invasion from the Celtigars, which they're starting to realize may not have been as much of a threat as first suspected. A diplomatic delegation has been sent to the Vale to try to gain their alliance and that of the Stormlands for use of their ships as the Brunes plan a retaliation for two centuries of abuses from the Valyrians. Tensions have steadily ratcheted up with the Dusklands, with a daughter previously offered to marry a Brune Prince instead being wed to Lord Velaryon, and the capture of a suspected Rosby spy in Dyre Den. Also there's a possibility that Houses Boggs and Crabb may have a small civil war over the infidelity of Lord Boggs' betrothed, Morgan Pyne.\n\n---\n\n**What is this game**\n\n[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CenturyOfBlood/comments/i31xjy/mod_post_porgs_pointers_rp_basics_in_century_of/) is a post explaining the basics of how to play the game.\n\nA text-based, roleplaying game, /r/CenturyofBlood allows you to fully experience the ASOIAF world and control your own house.

            "selftext": "I have several characters I've been wanting to revisit for awhile, I simply haven't had the drive to do so. Currently, I work 40 hours plus a week so I can't guarantee I will be the most active during the day, but I can assure you will get a few replies a day. This post will contain several of my characters along with plot ideas so it's bound to be a bit long.\n\nMy rules are you must be over 18 as I am 24, I prefer NSFW positive folk, I will look at non-cis male partners most, I would like at least three sentences per reply, you must be flexible and willing to add to a story, I write almost exclusively on Discord and prefer it as a medium. I pretty much only write men and rarely take on canon characters. I prefer story/world building over taking from canon storylines. All my characters are bi/pansexual so characters of all genders are welcome. As someone in the LGBTQ+ community, I have a special spot in my heart for healthy, loving queer relationships, so I would prefer a few not cis-het pairings! All my characters use real person faceclaims and I would like if yours did as well. Please send me a message, either PM or DM, letting me know which character you'd be interested in fleshing something out with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Ashton Channing is a world renowned adventurer, known for finding artifacts in dangerous places and taking down beasts five times his size. He is a cocky, boisterous man and I would love to see him in a plot where a character follows him on one of his missions. I can see them getting into trouble along the way as the follower isn't as skilled or experienced as Ashton. I would also love a plot where Ashton is mortally wounded and has to be taken into a magic based kingdom where he's cared for by the prince/princess/royal heir despite being there to snatch up an ancient relic.\n2. Caspian Redbone is the Captain of Neptune's Curse, a ship full of many secrets and drunken stories. He's a patient, caring person who can be quite a flirt. For him, I could see a similar plot of someone wanting to follow the crew on an adventure while being taught by the legend himself. I would also love a \"damsel in distress\" plot where they come across someone who *seems* to need their help but is able to hold their own. I do have a few more for Caspian, so please, feel free to ask!\n3. Maxwell Prince, a bar owner in Los Angeles, has been struggling to raise his daughter since his ex-fiance abandoned ship. He's a typical soccer/PTA dad who wants the best for his kid. For him, I can see a fling between him and a teacher or perhaps a single parent who's also devoted to their child sees an opportunity to give him someone to rely on. Either way, I need some PTA drama.\n4. Maxwell Hoover, a young employee at a local record shop in Malibu, but he would much rather be at home, doing nothing. He's a really calm, laidback person so I would love to see him with someone serious and intense, or someone who's shy and nervous, either a new employee or a regular at the store, maybe even someone he skates the boardwalk with.\n5. Chase Montgomery, a music theory professor at Boston University. He's a warm, kind, inviting person who loves to share his craft with young minds. I could see him with a new or perhaps seasoned professor with a pessimistic attitude. He's also a frequent face at his favorite bar where he goes to grade schoolwork. A bartender or other regular could totally shake his life up.\n6. Ashton Deford is my apocalyptic OC based in a world where androids run the world that is now completely owned by the social elites. He's the current leader of the Resistance and is frequently found attempting to recruit scared peoples into the underground tunnels where they live. I must mention that Ashton is a trans man who has been on HRT since he was 17. I could see him in something with a grateful member of the Resistance or even with a more sentient android. Either way, he's pretty flexible.\n7. Trickster is, well, the trickster of the underworld. Known for playing pranks and driving people to madness, he recently left a soulbond with his last victim. He now forces his demon side down to focus more on his developing humanity. He's currently a renowned musician who uses his mental manipulation powers to sell his music. He is also incredibly flexible and can be paired with supernatural or human characters in tons of situations.\n8. And finally, we have Jay Carpenter. Jay is a demonic entity from the Devil knows where. They're virtually genderless but take on the form of a feminine body as to not draw attention to themselves. They could be paired with a human, an angel, a demon, anything really so long as there's reckless chaos to cause.",

            "selftext": "Because pepper makes them sneeze!\n\nHey there! Me again! I posted yesterday but got very few messages, and the ones I got didn\u2019t work out. Maybe I chose a bad joke. Long-time role-player. I lost my old d-cord, had to create a new one, so I\u2019m searching for my old friends, and some new ones. If I seem familiar, please reach out! \n\nJust looking for a buddy or two that can help write some fun stories with me! I don't have any particular ideas, right now. If you do, I\u2019d love to hear them! I love a good fantasy setting, historical setting, sci-fi, but I'm open to collaborating. Having a craving for something dark, maybe with vampires, or werewolves, demons, dragons, or magic. If that\u2019s not your cup of tea, please still message me! I\u2019m NOT into Slice of Life, modern settings, or Fandoms.\n\nA little about me. I'm 27 (so please be around my age. I can't be doing this with an 18 year old, sorry. Maybe 24 and up?) I've been role-playing on and off since I was about 14, so this isn't anything new. I\u2019m on the East Coast of the US. I do work full time, but I\u2019m working from home and can reply during the day and at night. I\u2019d love someone who can send more than one message a day. Reply length doesn't really matter to me, the longer the better, of course, but it's quality over quantity. Txt tlk annoys the bejesus out of me, pls don\u2019t tlk lyk dis. I don't really have any limits when it comes to quantity. I typically play female character, but I'm open to playing both, and am willing to play multiple characters as needed.\n\nAs I said, I don't have any specific ideas in mind, I'd love to hear anything! I can also come up with an idea, if you have none and I like our vibe. Oh! Also, I don't want this to be just business. I'd like to also make a new friend, and occasionally have conversations outside the story. If that's cool with you?\n\nWell, I think that's everything! If you're still here, and are still interested, please shoot me a message, maybe start off with a joke! I look forward to meeting you!",

            "selftext": "Hey my name is Spoon. I've been role playing a long time. I used to write on play by post sites but lately I've been taking to Discord. I have a lot of ideas and I can make a character for just about any situation. If you think we'd be a good fit message me even if one of my ideas didn't grab you.\n\nOk so I prefer MxF pairings. My characters are all very different so lets talk about what we like. It'd be cool if we were friends. Vent to  me, share pictures of your cat. Show me videos and songs you like.\n\nOk onto my ideas. I've been really into historical settings lately. Here are a few which have grabbed my attention.\n\nREVOLUTION:   1770's in New England. My character could be involved in the sons of liberty or maybe even a British soldier. There's a lot of fun things we can do here. Intrigue, drama, historical slice of life. I'm down to plot all sorts of things.\n\nTHE NEW WORLD: I've tried to get something going in this era a few times. My idea was for a Pocahontas sort of story where a soldier or a trapper happens upon a native girl and something grows between them. If that's not your style I'd love to try a homestead slice of life. A couple in a new settlement trying to get by and start a life from scratch.\n\nCOUNTRY ASUNDER: The Civil war. Not my favorite time period but there's some room for some good drama here. Is she a southern belle while he's a   union soldier maybe injured in her town? What if he's the master of a plantation and he's trying to make it through the war while deciding where his loyalties lie.\n\nSALEM:   Never done this one but the witch hysteria is very close to my heart. We'd be in Salem during the witch trials but here's the catch. What if   the magic is real. She could be a witch and he could be just about anything. Would he be scared? What if he had fallen for her before he knew.  \n\n\nOther periods I'm interested in:  \n\n\n1950's Slice of life  \nWW2  \n1980s  \nAncient Rome  \n\n\nI'm also a good GM and I can double. Lets build a world!",

This is a shot in the dark in regards to the intensity of this role, but I'm thinking many people would like to try!\n\nI am seeking a partner to play a sociopathic/psychopathic (perhaps serial killer?) antagonist against my female OC in our own psychological horror/thriller romance. I will play the role of a nurse (my OC) that your character finds themself unrealistically attached to after being admitted to a psychiatric ward and her being assigned to care for them. This attachment may be due to your character having some form of disorder, or previous record of such behavior. \n\nHaving said this, I ask that my partner have accurate knowledge of the mental disorder/illness they intend to portray, as I really want to get a feel for realism. You character will eventually form an unhealthy infatuation for my OC. This infatuation will drive them towards obsessive behavior, and they'll stop at nothing just to hear her say \"I love you\". Maybe they want more than that; maybe they need her all to themself, causing them to revert back to their old ways. My character would eventually form her own sort of attachment, as she desperately continues to redeem them in an society that would otherwise not hesitate to fear them. We can discuss the terms of these lengthy efforts and details once we've exchanged contact info. I would absolutely love to see how our characters would piece together in the grimy streets of some sort of urban setting. \n\nI play in 3rd person, but I can also do 1st! I prefer to have long-term partners, and I absolutely love getting to know them OOC. Please have a description for your character on hand. I play on Discord only. Please PM me if you're interested in playing this role! Thank you in advance!",

            "selftext": "It's time for a long plot!\n\n'Who are you? Well, that's up to you. Are you a spoiled child sent off by your parents to a remote island to do a job? Maybe. Are you a man that's trying to escape his past life and move onto a more calm one? Possibly. Or, are you just someone who has always wanted to work in a lighthouse? Could it be something else? A dark secret? Who knows.\n\nWhoever you are, you have one job. Tend to the lighthouse. You might have a bit of help from the owner, however he plans to leave after showing you the ropes. He even refuses to say what happened to the last guy that ended up in your shoes. Maybe sick of the ocean smell? Maybe the people there were horrible. \n\nSpeaking of people, there were three residents you were told of - a blind woman, a woman who was apparently quite recluse, and her grandfather. There were three houses in total, plus a shed for any tools you could have possibly needed. You weren't supposed to live in the lighthouse, but the small house next to it. The blind woman lived near the beach, and the recluse lived in a smaller house near the more wooded area of the island. Wasn't like the island was big, either. Could've housed a small community if it weren't for the fact of how spaced out the houses were. Not to mention the fog...and the rain. \n\nEach day was simple. When night came, you had to fuel the light, then crank the contraption that turned it. You had to turn it a few times a night, but it wasn't that hard. However, it became hard when the sandbags used to weigh the contraption down were cut. Or hidden in the light house's basement. Or, sometimes you would fall asleep momentarily, and when you awoke, patches of oil coated the walls, as if someone was...pranking you. Or was it something more?'\n\nHiya! How y'all doing? I hope you guys are well. You may have read the plot above - if ya did, good job! That's the plot I wanna write! It's a horror, as you might tell, and has a few...unfortunate happenings. Which calls for the tag - please be okay with writing horror and possibly stuff with blood! Not to mention, if ya want romance!\n\nSo, about me. I write third person, past tense. Plot was written in first cause it's way easier! I write on Discord and don't budge on that, nor do I budge on how I write. I reply often and usually do quite a few paragraphs per starter, though shorten down to one to three after the initial welcoming is done. \n\nSo, what do I want from you? To write third person, reply somewhat often, and be on the same literacy level! I adore correct grammar, and prefer yours be at least somewhat correct?\n\nOh yeah, plus uhhhh John Wick. Just watched the first movie so it's fresh in my mind. Since basically everyone who is important to him is dead, I'd like to see him in that plot, mostly due to the fact that I'm curious about how someone of a more physical and deadly nature would deal with the paranormal. If not, we could come up with a different plot. I could possibly play a canon character from a different universe, but I'd rather make a character. If ya don't wanna play him, fine by me! The plot above is made for original characters!\n\nAnywho, if you're interested, hit me up with a bit about yourself and what you're interested in doing! Don't comment on here! I'll be waiting!",

            "selftext": "I'm primarily looking for stories set in The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind (and perhaps other provinces of Tamriel.)  Info about original settings are at the end of this post.\n\n**My Writing Style:** Third person, past-tense.  I average around 3-6 paragraphs per post.  If I\u2019m setting up a scene or a backstory my posts can be several pages long.  During scenes with fast-paced dialogue my posts might only be a few lines.  It depends on what\u2019s going on in the story and I\u2019m not a fan of length quotas. \n\nI like descriptive, detailed writing.  That means laying out the scenery in each new location and continually describing facial expressions, body language, and clothing.  I flesh out the world with side characters and enemies when needed.  I know that's not everyone's cup of tea, but I'm looking for someone who writes that way as well.\n\n**Availability:** I can reply from **11am-3pm EST** and **10pm-1am**.  I can usually post multiple times a day, and I\u2019m looking for someone who likes to reply frequently as well.\n\n**Content:** I love stories with a decent amount of action and violence.  I also love interpersonal conflict and character growth.  Slice of life or political intrigue are going to be hard sells for me, but I'm more inclined if the setting really excites me.  \n\n**Romance**: I'm only interested in romance subplots if you're playing a humanoid male character, and it has to be **slow burn only**.  The romance should arise naturally as the characters learn about one another, sometimes taking weeks to fully develop.  I have a slight preference for playing female characters but I can play either.  I am very flexible and if there's a certain type of person you want me to play I'll probably say yes.  \n\nMy preference for the race of my character would be Khajiit&gt;Orc&gt;Mer, and in settings outside of TES I like to play inhuman or even monstrous characters.\n\n**What I'm Looking For in a Partner:**\n\n* Literacy.  I don't expect you to be perfect or to never make typos, but know how to proofread your own work.\n\n* Add something new when you post, don't only react to me.  If you won't help build scenery, if you describe nothing, if you never handle side characters, and if you treat me like a GM, I'll drop you very quickly.  **Seriously, if you are a lazy person who forces your partner to lead 100% of the time, don't contact me.**\n \n* Know how to design characters with flaws, problems, and motivations that will help drive the plot forward and carry them through a satisfying arc.  I create fresh characters custom tailored to the plot and for synergy with my partner's char.  I'd be overjoyed to meet someone who does the same.\n\n* I love to write.  A lot.  I can write for hours a day, and give you 5+ posts a day if our schedules line up.  I'm looking for someone else who loves to write a lot and won't let the RP stall at one post a day.  I promise I will NEVER bug you for a post \u2013 I also have days when I just don't have the time or the interest, so I get that.  But slow Rps bore me and I won't stick around if the pace is consistently slow.\n\n* An interest in mature, serious, intelligent plots.  If you're familiar with ASOIAF, that sort of tone is exactly what I'm after. \n \n**Original Settings:** I *might* be interested in other settings if you have one that is fleshed out. I have some custom settings as well, ask if you want to hear more.  I am not going do any world building from scratch, or play in a custom setting that has no lore written up in an easily digestible format.  Let's be real here \u2013 most Rps end within a few posts.  I don't want to spend days discussing the setting when I have no idea if all that work will pay off. \n\n**When you message me, please send a writing sample.  My sample is below and I can provide more if requested:**\n\nIt was the 16th of Frostfall and the first snow of the year in this part of the world. Large flakes drifted softly down from a washed out sky that might have been one giant blanket of cloud. A column of soldiers rode along a dreary little road, their horse's fetlocks spattered with mud. There was no idle chatter among the soldiers; the mood among them was bleak as the skies. They'd come from Chorrol, where the enemy had been effectively routed and prevented from capturing the castle, but not without heavy casualties.\n\nNear the rear of the column, along with the carts carrying what few supplies they had left, trudged several soldiers without horses. One of them was a Khajiit. At first glance it was hard to tell what race she might belong to. She was sturdily built like a cathay-raht, but only 5'6\u201d \u2013 perhaps one who had suffered malnutrition or other hardship as a youth.\n\nShe was dressed in the same kit as many of her comrades in arms: chainmail over a gray gambeson, mail coif that hid her ears, leather gauntlets, and a red surcoat trimmed with gold. A black boar's head was stitched on the right. Over her padded chausses she wore leather greaves that were part sabaton, covering the front of her shin and foot. Her paws were caked with mud from the road she traveled. She carried a steel shortsword on her baldric and a buckler on her arm, with flaking red paint and deep scars in the wood.\n\nShe had the dull look about her of one who had seen death too many times to be much impressed by it. Like many cathay-rahts she had a thick-skulled head with wide cheekbones, but a short muzzle that tapered down into an almost delicate mouth. She was dusty gray on most of her body except for a white jaw. The fur was dull in color and in sheen, suggesting either poor health or age, although her true age was near enough to twenty-eight. Even beneath the tattered, bloodstained surcoat her build was clearly muscular.\n\nBut her most striking feature, the first thing one noticed when looking at the Khajiit, was a slanting scar that ran from the bridge of her nose to the left side of her mouth. It was obviously an old one. It had cut her upper lip open and had healed imperfectly. She was scarred in many other places on her body but most were small and hard to see in her fur. No fur grew on this scar.\n\nPresently the Khajiit lifted dull yellow eyes to the South, which was her right. The hill the road cut through sloped down toward Lake Rumare, which from her vantage point seemed large as an ocean. Beyond that rose the pale spectre of White-Gold Tower. She'd never been to the capital of Nibenay before, but it was obvious what she was looking at. There was nothing else like it in this part of the world. She felt utterly incurious about the tower and turned her face forward again.\n\nFort Caractacus was just ahead, and even a half-mile down the road the Khajiit could see that the fort was a flurry of activity. One half-finished tower was covered with scaffolding that supported a crane. As the column passed under the gatehouse portcullis into an inner courtyard she saw civilians and soldiers alike hard at work sawing wood, cutting stone, limewashing the stones of the lower levels, carrying supplies to and fro.",

            "selftext": "\n\nHello! Im looking for a female (or someone playing one) to play as a dragon who gets saved by a dragon slayer who has had a change of heart. I want the rp to revolve around us building our relationship from distrust and fearing eachother to being so close wed be willing to die for eachother in a hostile world. Treating eachothers injuries and protecting eachother as best as we can. For those of you who\u2019ve read Eragon or dragon riders of pern then thats something of the inspiration  for this! \n\nHeres the setup!\n\nA dragon slayer has been hired to kill a dragon that has been stealing livestock in increasingly more destructive numbers. As he enters its lair he finds it in a rage. Defending itself from a group of smaller drakes trying to steal its lair. The dragon injured and on the verge of defeat, the slayer takes pitty and against all his training and oaths jumps in to help. \n\n\nFeel free to suggest any changes, and specific details are always up for a change. Send me a message and lets play :) i use reddit Dm\u2019s, chat or discord if you prefer! :)\n\nAlso to be clear because sone seem to be assuming the opposite. I am NOT looking for a human that can change into a dragon or otherwise. I also like to keep magic to a minimum. I also generally prefer the European style dragons and for those that haven\u2019t read the books i mentioned the dragon will be able to communicate via telepathy.\n\nMust be able to write detailed replies. Minimum one paragraph per reply and not be afraid to guide the story along with me instead of just reacting. Also if you have to go please let me know. The amount of ghosting that happens is incredibly rude and disheartening. :(",

            "selftext": "Hi! I am a 19 year-old female in GMT timezone. I am looking for a romance roleplay that is long-term and 18+. I only roleplay on Discord and am open to smut, of course if it fits into the story. I like to create worlds and incorporate drama in the form of outside events and other characters. I am super friendly and understanding and really like to become friends with my roleplay partners! I do prefer fairly literate and 3rd person writing!\n\nHere are some storylines I am playing around with, though I am happy to hear your ideas as well!\n\nChildhood friends end up going their separate ways after highschool, one going to college (my OC) and the other becoming a firefighter (your OC). One day, there is a huge fire in an apartment building where the girl lives and the boy is the one to save her. Afterwards, she is homeless and terrified with no where to go, so he offers to let her stay with him. Though, the two seem to have some tension now that they are grown.\n\nA Hitman (your OC) falls in love with the girl (my OC) he has been hired to kill, so he must protect her from the powerful man who is trying to have her killed. erecting",

So, I'm a 21 Y/O female seeking an 18+ person to rp what is basically the life and times of the Todoroki family of My Hero Academia. I've been interested in them for awhile, and I feel like there was so much left unexplored as of where the anime is. I will NOT be rping with minors in any way, shape, or form because of my age.\n\n\nI have an OC (though I play more than just her, I promise, I know that can sometimes be an issue), meant to be Shoto's twin, I can either send her info off the bat, or just give a general run down and let her be unveiled as the rp goes. I'm alright with OCs as well, but I'd like for the Todoroki family to be the main focus. \n\n\nI'm on mobile 99% of the time, so my posts aren't particularly long--we'll say between one and three paragraphs, I'm not writing any books here, and i don't expect others to either. Hope to hear from yall, have a beautiful day!",

            "selftext": " \n\nIn the year 2794, nuclear bombs were dropped on the United States from Russia, bringing a several year long Cold War full circle. Thankfully, prior to this, a majority of children and adults alike had already been evacuated underground. However, the government\u2019s solution to this and to get the world moving once again was less than desirable. They began \u2018enhancing\u2019 the younger generations with robotic parts to permit them to fight through the radiation and be more durable should an event like this ever occur again, and to fight the war going on above them. These children were taken from a young age, and trained and enhanced as they grew older. They began with 50, and under half of that remains. This is not the first group to be forced through this process.\n\nThe children come from various backgrounds before being taken between the ages of 0-13, Very few of them recall much of this past, and only know the laboratory they\u2019ve been raised in for the past 13 years\u2026\n\nThe outside world is inhabited by few, the landscape being a mostly barren wasteland that can support little life. Underground settlements are where most of the world inhabits now. \n\nWe feature:  \n\\- An original, Dystopian/Sci-Fi Story, taking place in a world similar to the Fallout Franchise.\n\n* Active and friendly staff! We treat everyone in the community as friend and family.\n* A collaboration project that you\u2019ll be able to have a hand in helping us write! All backstories are connected as the characters have grown up together. Everyone plays a part in this story!\n* An RPG/D&amp;D Style experience, with missions, NPCs, branching storylines, Alliances, etc. \n* Murder Mystery Aspects in the beginning weeks! (Think the Danganronpa Franchise.)\n* A growing and sweet community always willing to lend a helping hand\n* A story heavy and event filled, long term roleplay!\n* Opportunities to make new characters to take part in a growing story.\n* Semi-Lit to Literate style roleplaying! If you\u2019re a wordy person who likes to write a lot, this is the place for you!\n* Multiple channels to share writing, artwork, etc!\n* Community events such as game and movie nights, as well as free roleplay channels to practice your skills or find a new partner!\n\nYou will likely need to create a new character for this! Due to the limitations of the world and specific backstory options and guidelines that need to be followed. However, there\u2019s still a lot of wiggle room to be yourself and branch out to do what you enjoy! There\u2019s plenty of space to be original and make your character like none other. \n\nThis Roleplay will deal with heavy and possibly triggering situations!! Please keep this in mind!\n\n9 Slots currently remain open, though more may open up! We hope you\u2019ll join us in this one of a kind experience, in our growing family!  \n\n\n[https://discord.gg/2Pend56](https://discord.gg/2Pend56)",

            "selftext": "Greetings and Salutations! My name is    T and I hope everyone is safe in their corner of the world. I am 27   and  have been roleplaying for a little over a decade now.\n\nA Few Things About Me.\n\nThing    1. I consider myself as a literate individual with a good grasp of  the   English language. I might not always get everything right but for  the   most part I do. I try to aim between two to three paragraphs a  reply   unless I feel the situation calls for more. In which case I will  give   more.\n\nThing 2. I\u2019m very  detail   orientated. I try my best to describe things in an  all-encompassing sort   of way and think that in doing so it brings  about a greater story.\n\nThing 3. My replies are sporadic but if I\u2019m into a story I tend to reply more.\n\nThing    4. The biggest thing for me is communication and not doing the aptly    named \u201cghosting\u201d. There is nothing more annoying than starting a  story,   giving my time, and being ghosted. It\u2019s quite honestly the most    disrespectful thing you can do to a fellow writer. If you think you    might ghost or something please do not message me and save us the time.\n\nThing    5. I am interested in adult themes and content. We can talk more  about   what that means but that does mean within the romance between  the two   characters as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nToday I\u2019m looking for something of an original period piece. Specifically, I\u2019m looking for the bombastic colorful action that is the cold war! Of course by bombastic and colorful I mean the Cold War type stuff you see in movies! Not so much the realistic version. \n\nI\u2019m looking for spies, music, gun fights, and seduction. I\u2019m pretty open on the actual meat of the story. So there are a few options here. I know I will be playing a spy (American or British) and would prefer to find a spy or some kind of girl deployed by her intelligence agency to seduce my agent. \n\nWe could either be two spies battling it out together. \n\nWe could play something where your girls intelligence agency uses you to get to my character. \n\nOr something where we work for the same agency but there is some heat there. \n\nI\u2019m NOT looking for Damsels in distress situations. Not someone who\u2019s been caught or in a position she doesn\u2019t want to be and my character must safe or protect her. \n\nSo if you\u2019re interested let me know!",

            "selftext": " Hey!  The world is full of people, and apparently some want to roleplay so  here I am. Let's escape together to better (although objectively worse)  lands!\n\nEither way, right now I  really want to  roleplay something in a medieval setting. This is  because I\u2019ve been  playing a lot of a game called Crusader kings, and  honestly I\u2019m still  waiting for those game of thrones books (I beg you,  don\u2019t spoil it even  more for me). So I\u2019m okay with anything as long as  it\u2019s medieval (although we could make it a renaissance or age of  exploration rp),  fantasy or not. What I do prefer is some world building  instead of using  something that already exists. But hey, I won\u2019t say  no to give it a try  either if you prefer that.\n\nNext I\u2019m going to present you with some ideas that we can flesh out if you aren\u2019t bored yet.\n\n**Errant magical knights**\n\nIt  might be a weird way to start a fantasy prompt, but when I was  introduced to star wars, I watched the original trilogy first, so for a  while I imagined the jedis as a decentralized organization. Errant  knights that would pass on their knowledge only if they found a worthy  apprentice in their many travels. Making no jedi like the other, and  making them so few in number that would actually make sense for them to  be legend. Anyhow, I would like to play that idea but with wizard  knights instead. We could be two full fledged knights on a mission, or  one of us could be an apprentice, or just a page that wants to become  one, or simply a hired blade or a person that was saved, I dunno.\n\n**The great wild**  \nI  love a song of ice and fire with a passion, so I'll steal something  from there. And that will be the night watch. I'd like this world to be  sort of like a post apocalyptic-medieval smash in which nature has taken  a hold of a vast majority of the world. Making it so only trained  warriors can venture beyond the walls of man, and into the great wild.  We could be rangers, or one of us could be part of a tribe beyond the  kingdom of men, etc.\n\n**The young king/queen**\n\nI  always like stories of characters rising up to the challenge, and this  prompt is for that. Maybe the kingdom is at war, or maybe court intrigue  is more dangerous. Either way I'd like for you or me to play a monarch  learning the ins and outs of leadership as it goes.\n\n**The lost throne**\n\nA fallen monarch and loyal companion in a quest to recover a throne, nothing more, nothing less.\n\n**Forging alliance medieval style**\n\nMaybe  it's part of a peace deal, or maybe it's two powerful kingdoms coming  together, but it might as well be part of the aftermath of a conquest,  or just a family getting rid of the black sheep of the family.  Anyhow, this is more for anyone of the opposite gender that likes the prompts since sadly I'm not attracted to everyone that walks on the earth, sigh. Also I'm more a softie and like a sweeter brand of romance if is going to be  involved in any capacity. So just two people coming to terms with it,  no bad vibes here.\n\n**Medieval fantasy with some avatar**\n\nEver  since I was a very smol I imagined people controlling elements, although it  was superheroes first, and then it was space opera, and finally I settled  into medieval fantasy. Anyhow, I just want to shoot fire or rocks  through my fingers. We can come up with a different idea, or make a  fusion of other prompts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat should be all. Thank you for reading! If you're interested let me know ideas that you might have for characters or the world in general. Or completely different ideas, I'm open to that as well.",

One prince or princess comes of age and must go through an event called The Selection where they must find love from a specific amount of contestants. \n\n**Royal Mistake**: a prince or princess from another country comes to America for school under a disguise and fake name, and falls for a regular American commoner.. It calls for big scandals if anyone finds out who the noble in disguise really is. \n\n**Rivals**: I have a few ideas for this one where we can create some sort of college rivalry plot. Our characters would be attending different universities yet somehow meet up and fall for each other. \n\n**Fandoms**: we can discuss Disney Descendants, Percy Jackson, Star Wars, Harry Potter, My Hero Academia, etc. All fandoms are OCs, no canon.\n\n**Fake Fianc\u00e9e:** Y/C and his fianc\u00e9e have recently called things off. There\u2019s only one real problem to this... He was supposed to bring her to meet the family at a huge family reunion/wedding/event of your choice. He resorts to calling M/C his college best friend or his best friend\u2019s slightly younger sister, maybe they\u2019re twins, idk.",

            "selftext": " \n\nThe year is now 4120. Humans took to the skies hundreds upon hundreds of years and discovered life on other planets. Not only that, but they discovered a network of sapient, space fairing races that had banded together to create a loose government that presided over the universe. Being inducted in almost immediately, Homo Sapiens grew to be a top tier race due to their ingenuity, creativity, and willingness to steal ideas from other cultures and evolve them. Through the combination of several other races byproducts, humans were the first race to create a true \u201cAI\u201d, or artificial intelligence that had the capabilities of emotions and the ability to *learn*. After several applications to various environments...the project was deemed too dangerous and true AI was banned across the entire universe. Those that existed were decommissioned or scrapped...the last one being \u201cturned off\u201d almost 200 years ago.\n\nDeep in \u201cdark\u201d space, large spaceships dedicated to holding prisoners of all races made sure that the worst of the worst never got to see the light of the sun again. This particular ship, one of the oldest in the fleet, was the UGF Phalanx. A high-security and expendable prison ship. That\u2019s where our story starts. Who is your character? An inmate with a dark past? Possibly a guard with a little too much empathy? Please let me know your ideas!\n\nThanks for reading. I\u2019m really interested in doing a sci-fi story based around a ragtag group of people just trying to survive. I\u2019m looking for a partner who can write 2 or more paragraphs and won\u2019t mind playing multiple characters. While it\u2019s not necessary, I\u2019d prefer it if you made a non-human race! Anything and everything you want. Please let me know through DM if you are interested!",

I can be Louis, Claudia, or anyone you want. I'm looking for someone to be lestat or Armand or maybe Louis. Other characters are welcome as well. Don't feel shy to message me if you have any questions. \n\nOne if the big things kd like to do is explore Louis and lestats relationship. And maybe even a little of lestat and Nicki. If you've only seen the movie that's fine too. \n\nI look forward to discussing a plot and such with you.",

            "selftext": "This is going to be $hi+show of explanation, so bear with me a bit. I'm trying to murk through some of my own thoughts and ideas here while I write this, so it might be a bit all over the board.\n\n_________________________________\n\nI need an Aehla.\n\nI don't really know how else to describe it, or how else to phrase it most concisely. But I need this key supporting character that we've created to help me along to develop this story and backstory of how everything came to be, and how we got to where we are today. Aehla is a bit of an enigma, and even *her* backstory is murky at best... so there is room for development there. She's part farmhand, part space ship mechanic. She falls under the same archetype as Kaylee (Firefly) and Parvati (Outer Worlds), but is a bit more hardened and weathered. Both innocent and jaded, both naive and knowledgeable, both talkative and closed off. Like I said.... enigma. She speaks with a southern twang, but not quite a hillbilly or southern belle. Definitely is NOT a city girl, but knows about some city things.\n\n_________________________________\n\nI'm looking for someone to help me a long with some character development and audio-based roleplay. I have an original \"character\" (Mitchel Bly, aka 'The Merv') that I play as a part of a greater RP, but I say \"character\" in quotations because it's more of a characterization of myself and how I would play out the situations that I find myself in. Let me see if I can breakdown a few things here, and maybe that would help:\n\n## The RP:\n - This RP takes place in the universe of *Elite: Dangerous*, a space exploration and combat videogame developed by Frontier Studios. This is __absolutely__ unimportant, as the setting is the only element that's important at this point.\n - The year is 3295, and humanity has advanced to become a space-faring and galactic civilization. This specific part of the RP takes place on a terraformed Earth-like world called Epirus, but may include settings far beyond this.\n - This is a *human* story, and does not include interactions with aliens, extraterrestrials, etc.\n - The RP is from the FIRST person, and is intended to be acted out real-time (think DnD without the dice).\n\n## The format:\n - This RP already exists in a few different formats. It is an ongoing *text based* RP on Discord that takes place in the year 3305 - well after the events laid out here.\n - ***I am currently creating this RP as a series of 'audio logs',*** and would like to continue to do so if possible. Incorporating other spoken characters in this RP would be cool, but it is not a must.\n - Here is the first 'log' that I made (warning: it's mostly me just rambling like an idiot). https://drive.google.com/file/d/17zEwSmBYgiPw88muzWZoRhy42r6dy4_4/view\n\n## The problem:\n - Mental energy is limited, but motivation is high. I have at __least__ an hour every day to work on this now, which is ***great!***... but development and direction is a bit lacking at the moment and that's really something I need to work out. I have a starting point and an ending (ish) point; I need to figure out the in between.\n\n## The goal:\n - Continue to develop and record RP audio logs to paint an fuller picture of WHO my character is and how he got to where he is now.\n\n_________________________________\n\nIn an __ideal world__, I'd love to have a 10 minute Discord **voice call** with someone who'd be interested (in acting, participating, or just helping) to see how things go. We could discuss what we each have ideas for, what we'd like, or may just ask each other questions? Like I said, I'd very much like to (a) explain this more in depth if possible and (b) keep this going, but I feel like its time to get more voices involved.\n\nSend me a PM if this is something you might be interested in and we can go from there!\n\ntl;dr: I have been recording 'audio log' RPs during my commutes. I have a direction, but that direction is vague. Looking for someone to discuss with, or for a co-actor.",

I have had some great experiences with people, and of course, like I\u2019m sure most everyone here has had, I\u2019ve had some terrible ones. I discovered this page literally less than an hour ago, and I have read some pretty great starters thus far! So good, in fact, that I decided to make my first post on here!\n\nI am looking for someone to create a whole new world with. I prefer something that is longterm, but if we start talking and short term seems to be a better option, I am more than happy to adjust my preferences. I want this to truly be a two-way experience. I would love to do a romantic slice of life roleplay; however, I am genuinely open to try anything. I have a few specific ideas in mind, but I appreciate new input, and any ideas/starters you may have. \n\nMust be 18+\nNot against smut, but don\u2019t want to force anything\nPlease, no \u201ctext\u201d talk. \nPlease pm me with any questions you have, or if you\u2019re interested!\n\nI prefer to roleplay over Discord, but if we need to go someplace else, I will oblige. I hope to hear from people who are looking for a similar experience! Have a great day!",
