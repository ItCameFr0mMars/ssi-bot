            "selftext": "Hey, everyone. These days I'm usually looking for fandoms, but I periodically decide to resurrect all my old original concepts on the off chance I might find a really great partnership (or two). Hopefully I'll catch someone's eye. (: (If I have for some reason neglected to get back to you, PLEASE feel free to prod, poke, or slap me upside the head. Life has been somewhat out of control and I'm a derp.)\n\nI do have a few things for which I'm specifically looking in a partner, though, so let me lay those out for you before I get ahead of myself:\n\n1. I'm looking for \"advanced/literate\" partners with as much love of the language as I have (know your possessives, \"your\" vs. \"you're,\" proper comma usage, flowing sentence structure, etc.).\n2. I only do hetero pairings, and my characters in these ideas are all female.\n3. I'm a SFW writer. Think PG-13; I love romance and conflict, but don't get gross. That said, 18+ partners are still preferred.\n4. I'm well into my 20s, so I don't feel comfortable writing with minors.\n5. Email is preferred, but I can do others. Just ask.\n6. I don't do one-liners. Multi-para, please. Give me something to work with (without giving me eight-page novellas every post).\n7. Sometimes I disappear. It happens. I have major depressive disorder and can sometimes lack the motivation to reply. If that happens, poke me. I might say I'm not into it, or I might just be having a bad day. If it doesn't work out between us, please know that it's me - not you.\n\nAll righty, so, ideas next? I think so.\n\n**A. Moon Dancers (Medieval Fantasy):**\n\nMost of life as humanity knows it is lived during the day. The world awakens at dawn and retires at dusk, unfailingly. There are nocturnal beasts, of course, but those are just animals. And what traveler or criminal hasn\u2019t stayed up to walk by the moonlight many a time himself? Even still, night is meant for sleep and silence, and daytime for work and play. But that\u2019s not true of every sentient race in the world. There is a race of people, called the Aventine (AH-ven-teen), who not only live their lives at night, but are physically incapable of retaining consciousness in the daytime. Think of them as the \u201celves\u201d of the world \u2013 magical, fairly mysterious, largely peaceful, in tune with nature. Not a lot has been known about them over the centuries. They keep to themselves most of the time. In old days, they would even play harmless, good-natured tricks on their human counterparts, or leave playful messages, or sit and soothe a child who had awakened in the night while his parents slept on. There was goodwill between the two peoples. They were seen as anything from myth and folklore, to guardian angels, to fairies, to spirits of good fortune and blessing. But just as with anything people don\u2019t understand, mystery eventually turned to wariness. A wedge was driven between them as mutual suspicion and fear began to take root, and the \u201cMoon Dancers\u201d (humanity\u2019s nickname for them) withdrew into themselves. They have to be the more proactive in protecting themselves, after all, because of their very nature. Like I said, the Aventine are only active at night. When the morning comes, they immediately fall into a deep slumber, like flowers that only bloom in the evening. Nothing can break that sleep, and it\u2019s not possible to \u201cstay up late.\u201d They\u2019re completely vulnerable if this happens out in the world \u2013 not something you really want when the other race finds you unnerving at best and downright malicious at worst. What usually happens, and is supposed to happen, is that they retreat into the Vale, a magical place kind of existing outside the normal realm. There, they\u2019re free to sleep and dream away the whole day. Now, I have in mind to play a young Aventine woman with your typical failings of curiosity, rebelliousness, wanderlust, and inquisitiveness. She\u2019s restless with this careful life of secrecy, always watching the sleepy human towns and villages, wondering if they\u2019re really so bad. I\u2019d like the other role to be left up to you: do you want to play a human? Someone who encounters her, with ensuing potential for adventure as they learn about each other and have to protect each other from their respective peoples? Or do you want to play another Aventine who is either tasked with keeping her out of trouble or is trying to convince her because he actually cares for her, with that potential for adventure as they\u2019re discovered and cut off from the Vale and have to navigate this terrifying world ruled by humans? There are lots of possibilities here, and I\u2019d really like to brainstorm with you more about the world, the story, etc. The only thing I ask is to play against a male character, because\u2026hopeless romantic.\\~\n\n**B. The Wyv (Medieval Fantasy):**\n\nThere are beings called Wyverns in the world. They have a form that looks like normal humans on the surface, and they were once a thriving, powerful race. They have formidable magic, live extraordinarily long lives, are even purported to have prophetic capabilities, and their other forms are similar to dragons - hence the name. Derp. They lived largely in peace with the other races of the world, even somewhat deified by mortals. A long time ago, the other races of the world started hunting them like animals, sometimes for the hide of their beast forms, sometimes to harness their magic. They were largely wiped out over the years and are now very rare and *very* hidden. A lot of people actually think they're extinct, and some don't believe they were ever anything more than legends and fairy tales. The discovery of one would be a big deal, and among nations that are in conflict, having something like that in their arsenal would give the holder quite an edge. I would like to play a young Wyv either in captivity by one such nation, or on the run from it, and I'm looking for someone to build his/her own *non-Wyv* character and collaborate on the world and story with me. I want you to have creative freedom with your character. The only thing I ask is that there be no human-animal hybrids, and no other Wyv. That would defeat the purpose.\n\n**C. Demon Seed (Medieval Fantasy):**\n\nSo, the idea is that there's this one kind of magic that is seen as unholy and evil. It's also an exceedingly rare gift; someone is born with it only once every (insert large amount of time here). There is a legend and superstition surrounding them that says they're the descendants of a demon who in ancient times came and bred with mortal races to corrupt them and steal them away from their benevolent gods. These people are referred to as demon seeds and are both hated and feared. They're seen as bringers of death and misfortune. And over the eons, this view has been supported by the seeds - because being hated and mistreated will ruin people, and many of them became the villains everyone said they were.\n\nMy girl will be the current seed, shrouded in superstition, trying to make sense of what she actually is and how the world sees her. I'd like to discuss more world- and story-building with my partner and leave the other character up to you entirely.\n\n**D. Inseparable (Medieval Fantasy):**\n\nThis one is actually the only one in which I'm not looking for romance. Rather, I'm looking for a deep platonic bond between my character, a sentient creature type, and yours, some sort of humanoid creation (the only races I'd like to avoid are the ones considered half creature/half human).\n\nNow, bear with me, here. My character is a half-demon (apparently I'm in a demonic mood?) tigress. There are two \"clans,\" for lack of a better word, of feline creatures that are more than just wild animals. They're bigger, they're sentient, they can \"speak\"; think of them as more spirit creatures than animals. I gave them ridiculously corny names eight years ago when I came up with this, so I'm not going to embarrass myself by putting them here - but essentially, the panthers are bad, and the tigers are...considerably more benevolent. You do not want to run into a panther at the best of times; you only have to worry about a tiger if you've wronged them or the lands they protect. Panthers are demon-cats, like one of my tabbies would be if she had supernatural abilities. If it helps, I'll call the tigers the angels. Guardian spirits, more like.\n\nSo. My character is the product of mixed parentage. Her mother was a tiger; her father was a panther. Don't ask how that happened. The world is not black and white. She lost her mother as a cub, however, when poachers raided the glen her kind called home and pretty much wiped them out (my guess is they had some help, if you know what I mean). I would like to find someone to play a character who finds this little mystical fuzzball, \"raises her,\" probably without either of them really knowing what she is, and thus creates such a sweet, timeless bond of friendship.\n\nWe could either start with their meeting and then time-skip to adulthood a few years later, or start with adulthood. Beyond that, the challenges they face, the rest of the story, any baggage of your character's own to bring into play - that's all open and up for discussion. It's just the relationship and my own character I have.\n\n**E. Wishes &amp; Whims (Flexible):**\n\nSo I had a dream last night, and it's led me to doing some plotting and musing today. I'd like to do something involving a genie, of sorts - only not exactly the typical \"three wishes\" deal. I envision young female spirit sort of being, trapped by some great power and freed by a young man, who then becomes her \"master.\" Now, I'm not talking about *that* kind of master, so kindly get your mind out of the gutter. She would attach to him; want to do things for him and make him happy; protect him at all cost. It may be that once, these beings were in partnership with humanity (and/or other mortal races); a soul link would be created between two individuals who were compatible, and they would fight together, with the human(oid) channeling the spirit's energy. I'm thinking that there are certain people who are *born* with the innate ability to link with them. Perhaps humanity began taking advantage of this partnership/pact system, however, and began using the links to conquer instead of just protect. So, most of them abandoned humanity and refuse to pact now - but she didn't. She still believes, and is waiting for her soulmate.\n\nOr maybe she's just extremely grateful to be freed. I kind of like pact systems, and a bond growing out of that, but I'm totally open to discussion and brainstorming, too! It's just a rough idea I pulled out of the air, anyway.\n\n**F. Fish Out of Water (Realistic/Fantasy):**\n\n(Note: This is probably the lowest on my preference list. I've had a few attempts to start it, but it always sort of falls flat. So I'd love to get a really good version going, but I'm a little discouraged about it. Keep that in mind.)\n\nThis is kind of a mix of modern realistic and medieval fantasy settings. It involves a young man from the \"real\" world (our world), and a girl from another world entirely; a world with magic and knights and medieval kingdoms. However, unlike your typical, patriarchal systems, her homeland recognizes equal female authority, as well as female knights and warriors. The world from which she hails is currently under threat of cataclysm, and the girl in question is one of those warriors. Though young, she was tracking down some magical doo-dad to help her country turn the tide of impending doom, but she was intercepted by a powerful sorcerer on the other side. There was a fight, and in the commotion, the artifact was destabilized, and there was an accident. She (along with the object) got dumped into another realm. Boom. Earth. She has no idea where she is, or how to navigate this odd place and its even odder customs. Enter your character. Whether he's some plain 9-to-5-er, or something more interesting - that's up to you. It may even turn out he's some special, prophesied hero in her world and doesn't know it. The point is the comedy, frustration, and emotion of the fish out of water situation. If you've seen the movie, Enchanted, you can see an example of that - though I'm not intending to play a giddy, stereotypical Disney princess. She's fiery and determined. I do want a bond to form between them, though. And eventually, I think it would even be cool to take the RP back into *her* world, where *he's* the one floundering,\n\n**G. Reverse Phantom of the Opera (Paranormal or Fantasy):**\n\nSo, I've finally seen the show, and I love it, but I'm not looking for a direct copy. It simply serves as the inspiration for an idea I had; I'd like to change up the genders (i.e. female phantom) and potentially make her *actually* a ghost of sorts, or some other kind of being, \"haunting\" the theater. It's really just a rough, vague concept, but it's open to all kinds of discussion and interpretation.\n\n**H. Post-Apocalyptic:**\n\nI don't really have any specifics on this; it's more a general genre. However, I do not want zombies. I want something more sci-fi and dystopian than horror or fantasy. Ruined civilizations, humanity struggling to survive... That kind of thing. Rating rules still apply here, though!\n\n**I. Paranormal Collaboration:**\n\nTalking actual ghosts, here, not just things flying off shelves a la corny ghost hunting \"documentaries.\" I'd love to play a ghost against a human. Skillet's song, \"Lucy,\" inspired me a bit here.\n\n**J. Science Fiction:**\n\nI also love sci-fi and am happy to come up with an idea together. Except for my Star Trek love (Voyager), though, I'm not interested in space travel. I like artificial intelligence subjects and futuristic things, but not really keen on aliens and interstellar ambling.\n\n**K. Frozen (Medieval Fantasy):**\n\nBased on a song, not the Disney movie. This one is also not romantic, but I'm still looking for a male character. It involves twins, a young man and woman, and a massive secret kept by the sister from her brother at all cost. Historically, she had always been a happy, friendly, open girl. Suddenly, after the invasion of sorcerers and their demon familiars leads to the death of their parents, she becomes hard and closed off, but extremely protective of her brother. The exact reason remains unknown (though I'll happily tell you if you want spoilers), but the two are nearly inseparable as she tries to protect him and he tries to find his old sister once more.\n\nIt's based on the song, \"Frozen,\" by Within Temptation. If you listen to it, it will give you a good idea of what's going on. This is an old idea I had while playing WoW, so it's totally up for world-building and fleshing out.\n\n**L. Hand of Sorrow (Medieval Fantasy):**\n\nAs you might be able to tell, this story uses Within Temptation's \"Hand of Sorrow\" as its sort of theme song. Basically, there's a guy who's more or less a champion of his people. He's a knight or something, and he has to travel to some holy site to receive his calling. He has a lover, more of a clerical type; sweet and quiet and fully supportive. She accompanies him on the trek. However, once there, they both receive a calling of different sorts. They learn that a great evil will rise and that either the man will die or the evil will. The kicker? She's supposedly the one who will bring this evil to pass and be the greatest enemy. This freaks her out, and she hides herself away in fear for the man she loves and the world. He doesn't believe it and thinks there's another way, and they set out on some adventure in search of a different answer.\n\nThere's room for building and fleshing out on this one, too. Fun fact: I was also inspired by Nickelback's \"Lullaby\" when I came up with this one.\n\n**M. Angels (Modern/Realistic):**\n\nThis involves a cult of of people who believe in \"mercy killings.\" The primary doctrine, or mission, surrounds providing \u201cmerciful deaths to the irredeemably suffering.\u201d Fittingly, they call themselves \u201cHeaven\u2019s Host,\u201d and the individuals responsible the actual murders are specially-trained assassins called \u201cAngels.\u201d Terminology such as \u201cmercy,\u201d \u201crelease,\u201d and \u201cfreedom\u201d are used liberally while there is not a single mention of words like \u201cmurder,\u201d showing it to be a psychological state of delusion rather than a self-acknowledged band of hit men. The members of the Host truly believe that they are doing the work of angels and profess to value peace and compassion above all else, yet outside the walls of their weekly meeting place, every person appears absolutely normal, with normal lives and responsibilities. We can play this several ways: a \"suffering\" victim and their would-be \"savior,\" two members of the cult, or a member and a former member now marked as a target because they've fled and are deemed to be suffering. I d'know. We can talk.\n\n\\~\n\n...That was really long. I apologize. Hopefully, I didn't lose all of you to my incessant rambling. If you're still with me, please feel free to PM me. I don't respond to comments, so please use the PM function. Thanks!",

I love to write detailed descriptions and delve into a character\u2019s head/emotions as well as surroundings. I compare it to writing a novel together.\n\nI understand if the scene doesn\u2019t have alot going on and therefore requires less like rapid-fire. I adore having long, thoughtful replies where we truly immerse ourselves in the world. I'm hoping to find a  partner whose as enthusiastic and passionate about the plot and writing as I am. When I get invested in a story, it\u2019s 100% dedication. Getting a reply is the highlight of my day.\n\nI'm a big fan of romance and using face claims. I\u2019m the type to make pinterest boards, spam you with gifs, headcanons, and send you songs that remind me of our characters and/or ship. I'll get excited if we come up with future plot ideas or if our characters are being cute or angsty.\n\nLast but not least I only do MxF (with\u00a0myself\u00a0in the female role and I'm looking for older male  characters). I don\u2019t double, but I\u2019m more than happy to write side characters of either gender to help move the story along. I'd highly prefer female authors writing male characters.\u00a0Male authors, please  stop contacting me.\u00a0I've been burned too many times. If you persist, I'll ignore your message. Sorry!\n\nDesperately Searching For\n\n* 21+ partners\n* For  you to have an excellent grasp of grammar, punctuation, spelling, and capitalization. Both in character and out of character. (Literate to advanced writers only, please. I'm not looking for newbies).\n* The more description, the better! I'm looking for someone can write as much  as me (2 to 4 paragraphs or more) and really bring the story to  life. I lose interest if I'm the only one that's invested/enthusiastic or coming up with plot ideas. Quality writing makes my heart happy, as does     world building together.\n* The use of real life face claims and joining me in the wonderful world of  ship/character development isn't a requirement but I'd sure be delighted if we were on the same page in this regard. (I won't use anime faces, only realistic art if you're uncomfortable with real life)\n\nIf you've made it this far, thank you! You won't be disappointed in  writing with me. I tend to be online daily and while I'd like it if you were too, I understand that real life things comes first. Please let me      know if you're going to be inactive, I'm in this for the long term.  If you suddenly stop replying ic and ooc, I'll drop the story after 2 weeks to a month.\n\n(Since I've gotten some messages about it, I'd like to say I have zero interest in slice of life plots) \n\nOriginal Genres:\n\n* Crime\n* Post Apocalyptic/Dystopia\n* Supernatural/Modern Fantasy\n* Southern/Mid-Western/Urban Gothic\n* Sci-fi\n* Superpowers/Gifted\n\nFandoms: (I don't write canons)\n\nStar Wars, X Files, Haven, Fringe, Stranger Things, Heroes, The Wolf Among  Us,\u00a0**Mercy Thompson Series**, **True Blood**, Marvel, The OA, Disney  (personified), His Dark Materials, Beastars, Horizon Zero Dawn, The Last  of Us\n\nAll my characters will be adults and I require my partners to do the same, as there will be adult themes in my writing.\u00a0For more plot and genre ideas, message me\u00a0\\^\\^ I can write over email or discord, and if we click I'd be happy to give out that info.\n\nPlease be detailed when you message me, let me know why you chose to contact me. Seeing only \"hey do you wanna rp?\" is a guaranteed way to turn me off.\n\nLook forward to hearing from you!",

            "selftext": "\nHello everyone, today I am looking for a long term, literate Roleplay set in the world of Elder Scrolls\u2014 I\u2019m looking for a partner who can play a female character.\nI\u2019m a huge fan of the series, and I\u2019ve played every single game; mastering the lore from the simple, to incredibly complex. \nI\u2019d absolutely love to do this RP, so please read the plot, and message me if this interests you. I do have a Discord, which I exclusively RP on. \n\nPlot:\n\n\n4E206, 5 years after the return of the dragons in the gelid, hyperborean land of Skyrim\u2014 after thwarting Miraak\u2019s stranglehold of ashy Solstheim, The Last Dragonborn... disappears. Tamriel exhales finally, after holding their breath during Alduin\u2019s prophesied return.  \nThe Empire manages to crush the Stormcloak Rebellion, but most of their military might is presently in Skyrim, if it was not for the Thalmor\u2019s cruel game of playing with their prey, the Cyrodilic bastion of hope would of already been razed to the ground. The Aldmeri Dominion are fixated with hunting down Redguard insurgents in the land of Hammerfell... giving them time to loosely organise a strong, but little force of Blades, who have been scattered across Tamriel, in an effort to secretly serve the Empire as efficiently as they can. \n\nBrucius Sethren, an Imperial Male, as well as a Great War Blades veteran, is stationed in Alinor, keeping his watchful gaze set on the Altmer... deep in the Lion\u2019s Den where he could be found out, and punished egregiously. An urgent message reaches him via bird- slinking past the Dominion\u2019s robust navy, and into his armoured hands. His orders were to head to the obliterated Vvardenfell... no further information is given about his quest. \nExcept, that was he to meet someone in mainland Morrowind. \nTheir identity is not mentioned. \n\nA dark presence lingers in Red Mountain, rumbles sound out from Akavir, and whispers of an ultimate Thalmor plot spreads throughout Tamriel. Only two heroes of prophesied legend can confront the pinnacle threat to Tamriel, Nirn, and even Mundus...\n\n\n\n\nThank you for reading my plot! I thought complete control over your character would be in order, which is why I gave little information about them. The race and role of your character is completely up to you, as well as how they were affiliated with the Empire/Blades. Are you a Dunmer noble? A defected Thalmor? An Argonian mercenary? You have complete control.\n\nAll plot points are up to our discussion, but the Roleplay would primarily focus on our two characters facing a new crisis- which could very well be the deadliest yet. \nRomance, action, adventure, and lore-making. \nThis RP has it all. \n\nPlease message me if this interests you; I also have a Discord I can provide in DM\u2019s.",

Widow picking up a gun to avenge her deceased husband (does she know how to use it? was her husband well known, a bad guy, a sheriff? was he murdered or was it an accident?)\n2. 3:10 to Yuma verse: disabled Civil War veteran trying to raise his family on a farm that cannot be taken care of, too poor to look after. He is looked down on in town. Does he help escort a notorious bank robber to prison? Does he sell his land? Will his wife leave him, taking their children and running off into the night?\n3. Honestly a slice of life with simple townsfolk is fine too. Want a doctor? Cool. A banker? A drunk? A ranger 'passing through'? Deputy or sheriff? Even a woman pretending to be a man, can't go wrong there. (Think Anne on Netflix slice of life)\n4. Something like Godless? Damnation? Lawless? Mix religion in there, mix supernatural creatures (or aliens)? Rural prohibition?\n5. Something collaborative with Native Americans (NOT to vilify them)\n6. A railroad is being built next to a dry-and-dying town. Most townsfolk are excited for more traffic and the economic boost. Are our characters suspicious? Do railroad workers start going missing? Local lawmen state most of the men are drunkards who cannot be trusted or relied on. Does one of our characters get 'visions' of the men's deaths? Is this a mystery, a horror, supernatural?\n7. REVENGE PLOTS. Widow, widower? Maybe a child dies from poor weather conditions or an illness passing through town? I want to explore the lawlessness or grit of the wild west, maybe useless deputy or sheriff, people stealing money, saloons, prostitution, anything.",

Tomorrow, everything was going to change. Tomorrow, she was going to become the wife of a stranger in another town.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Her mother had fallen ill on the eve of Ana\u2019s eighteenth birthday and never recovered. Within a year, she was dead and Ana was left as the lonely daughter of a fisherman who could barely scrape by, stricken with grief at the loss of his wife. During this grief and this struggle, her father had decided that it was best to marry Ana off to someone wealthier and give her a better chance in life than what her mother had, although to Ana nothing could be better than staying there on that beach.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;As she watched the sun sink over the gentle waves of the sea, Ana pondered what blow fate might deliver to her in the morning. The lowering of the sun seemed to mirror the sinking feeling in her chest.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;She allowed a single tear to roll down her face, before wiping the next few away and walking back up the short path to the shack that she called home one last time.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Tomorrow, nothing would be the same.\n\n\\---\n\nHi!

If I don\u2019t think we will work out, I\u2019ll just be honest about that; I won\u2019t ghost you.\n\nThank you!",

I'm not too lore-crazy, but I like the idea of using OCs in an established world that I've been playing around in for a while. \n\nI only have a few requirements/wants:\n\n\\&gt; Please be over 18\n\n\\&gt; Be literate! I've been RPing for many years, so I prefer depth and detail in writing - you don't have to write reams! As for replies, I'm flexible. I prefer someone who can kind of ebb and flow with me: sometimes I'll be bashing out answers for hours at a time, sometimes I can go a few days due to personal commitments. That said, if I am ever going to be away for a long time (2+ days) I will endeavor to let you know before!\n\n\\&gt; I'm happy to explore dark themes in RP, such as violence, drug use, etc. If there's anything you are specifically uncomfortable with, please let me know!\n\n\\&gt; I'm happy to write romance, but not the biggest fan of smut. If it has a place, sure, but I prefer to build a slow-burn relationship. In this situation, I prefer to play as a woman in a M/F relationship, but I'm also super happy to play side characters!\n\n\\&gt; I prefer to RP over Discord! \n\nIf that sounds interesting, feel free to DM me, and we can discuss more! I realise this is a little vague, but all I know is I have a craving for gallivanting around a wasteland\\~",

I have a long history with roleplaying and it consistently remained a passion for me throughout the years. \n\nI would enjoy a Final Fantasy VII roleplay involving romance. I would love to plot something out with you especially if it involves the pairings I love but I\u2019m fine with anything. \n\nI also have been trying to get back into Persona 5 and Persona 3 and would enjoy starting an rp in those fandoms, as well. \n\nI also love Miraculous Ladybug and would love any combination of Marinette (Ladybug) + Adrien (Chat Noir). \n\nAlso if there\u2019s any anime we both watched we could discuss rping that! \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n-Must be 20+ \n-1 paragraph or more for replies\n-OOC chat is important to me for plotting and general chatting\n-I would also appreciate someone patient that can give me a little tap for a reply if it\u2019s been a couple days\n\nThank you for reading!!",

            "selftext": " \n\nWhat I am looking for is a little different. I am looking for long term detailed roleplay. But it's going off of a story I have been writing. The whole idea in a nutshell is you will be playing three characters but the main one is the god of chaos. The other gods despise you and have tried for a long time to infuse another with there powers to be able to destroy you. That's where my character comes in. She's the daugther of the god of war and an elven Queen. When she was born they attempted the ceremony to give her the gods powers and it worked. So she was raised to destroy you. But instead you both fell in love with each other. So the council that oversees the gods decided to put up a veil separating the world of magic from our world now. Stating there is a prophecy that says I must live through ten different lives before I will bring you down. But because I am immortal that isn't possible. So erasing my memory and throwing me into this modern world now they just keep hitting reset on my lives. In each life we keep finding each other. You always know who I am because you don't die either and never forget. I on the other hand never remember.\n\nSo this is the last life, I'm a young woman in school, waitress to pay for school when I meet Chris (another one you will be playing) who is the son of the high elder who runs the council. Chris job is to make me believe in the magical realm and teach me to use magic here. And to try and convince me that you are the enemy. Then there is Slade (the third person you will play) , who hates my father for bashing him to the modern world and wants his revenge. Deciding the best way to get it, is through me.\n\nSo you can play the god of chaos how ever you want. He can be fed up with this and decides enough is enough and tries to kill me or we can fall in love again. Your call, there will be no love interest with Chris as my character will look at him as more of a brother and Slade can be as evil and do whatever you so choose to do to me with him. I am looking for character building and world building I can send the prologue for my story if you are interested . I want to do this on discord so if you are interested shoot me a message for my discord information. As well as any more information that you require.",

The reason I've been avoiding coming back to this community is a lack of confidence, I have a really hard time saying no to people. So, I'm trying to be a bit more... ruthless. Haha!\n\nI RP third/first person, present tense, Semi-lit to lit... eh. I am most familiar with writing as females but throw me a male or non-binary role and I'll go for it! For genres, I roleplay medieval fantasy, apocalyptic, etc. I stay away from modern stories, fandoms or things that involve a lot of history. Gore, sensitive topics, I have no boundaries, go for it, but please tell me your boundaries. I'm not big on Romance, being an Aromantic person myself, but if the characters click, they click. My replies may be a little slow, one or two a day, and I'll let you know if I'm going to be taking any kind of a break. I hope for the same. If you at ANY point are feeling uncomfortable or that I'm not up to your standards, PLEASE tell me. I have no specific ideas right now so, if you don't have one, we can just brainstorm! I mainly use discord but I'm open to docs and email (Though I've never used them before). Have an amazing day and night, everyone!",

            "selftext": "Hi Reddit,\n\nCall this an experimental post because I know the odds are against me, but what if.   \n\n\n**First about me and the type of roleplay I engage in:**  \nI'm female, well over 21+, and an advanced, literate style, novella writer. I prefer extremely detailed, well-written, and thoughtfully plotted roleplay that follows an over-arching narrative and cinematic plot. I like my characters complex, layered, and unique and get excited about things like especially creative turns of phrase and metaphors because I'm a dork for the language. I write strictly original stories, and pride myself on being able to construct edge of your seat twists and turns as well as play a big variety of character types. I seek partners who are on the same level and not shy about proving it. I write exclusively in Discord and usually create a server with channels for imagery, character bios, side material, and OOC chatter.   \n\n\n**The idea:**  \nWhat if we could roll back the God awful Suicide Squad, Justice League and Birds of Prey movies and start this Harley and Joker thing over again? My personal leanings are more towards the Dark Night and comic versions of these characters. I'd love to get something going where we borrow from comic and possibly film narratives, but take the story in an original direction and make the characters our own. \n\nThe idea of playing Harley is actually one I've kicked around since the 90s cartoons. Of course, because canon stories only attract the very worst and youngest players, I've never gotten it off the ground with anyone worth their salt. I'd like something genuinely scary, fun, gritty and believable, and I know it is a really tall order considering the subject matter here. So why keep trying? I don't know. I guess I love the characters and every few years I get a wild hare to put it out there and try again.   \n\n\n**The plot:**   \nStart with the basis for Mad Love - Harleen Quinzel is a new, young doctor at Arkham Asylum where the Joker is brought in to do his time. Her boss, Dr Arkham, is a cold man who doesn't care much for her, and assigns her to the highly dangerous job of acting as the Joker's doctor. She knows who he is, naturally, and had an adolescent sort of fascination with the clown prince that lead her to study psychiatry to begin with. After several sessions, he begins to drum up her sympathies, and eventually win her over.   \n\n\nWhen he breaks out and is dragged back to Arkham badly by Bats, Harleen has a break down. How dare he? Why did he have to do *that*? Her outbursts gets her fired, but no matter! This is when she first assumes the Harley Quinn role and returns to break the Joker out once and for all. This can play out as an early part of the plot where criminals are set free, Arkham goes up in flames, and Dr Arkham, gets what he deserves. I have some ideas of the Joker working on an early version of his patented Joker gas - maybe an adaptation of Scarecrow's poison that he's been quietly working out since being imprisoned, or even plotted to be sent to prison to get close enough to Scarecrow to sort it out.  \n\n\nFrom there? The sky's the limit! We can write our own plot to follow. All that is just a premise and a few ideas to get the ball rolling. These two can go on crime sprees and with some work we can create a real through line and eventual climax, even have repeated adventures. Anything.  \n\n\n**Requirements:**   \n\\- Must provide a *writing sample*; no exceptions.  \n\\- Must write in at an *advanced* level, in *novella* style, *third* person, *past* tense.   \n\\- Must post *at least* once per day 4-5 days a week; back and forth posting at least 1 day a week.  \n\\- Must have a genuine *love* for these characters and *knowledge* of backstory.  \n\\- Must be willing and able to *contribute* to an original plot; I cannot do this on my own.  \n\\- Must be able to *use their words* and *ask for what they want*.  \n\\- Must be *enthusiastic*!   \n\n\n**Caveat:**  \nI have other, fully original stories going right now, and I'm very well aware this shot in the dark might not have any takers. Or, that those who do contact me will 9/10 be completely awful because of the comic book premise. If this is something you want to do, you'll need to really bring your A game to it in order to convince me its worth it to throw myself into it. Bad attitudes and half-efforts will get ignored.  \n\n\nDid I make this hard and complicated enough? Haha... sorry. Helps to weed out the losers. I promise, I'm actually very nice and flexible. I want a partner and not someone I can boss. If you're enough of a trooper to get this far, message me and we can exchange Discord IDs.",

            "selftext": "Greetings. My name is Claire but I prefer to go by Misty online. I am currently **19 years of age** and live in the **US EST time zone.** I have been roleplaying for just over 7 years (almost 8). I prefer to roleplay on **Discord** as it allows me to check in more often and it is easier for me to organize.\n\nI tend to write anywhere from **2-6 paragraphs** but can write more on occasion, though I do tend to stick to that range. Unfortunately, replies could be slow at times due to motivation and scheduling conflicts but I will always try my best to let you know when I will be away. I can make characters specifically for an RP, but more prep time would be needed in advance.\n\nI prefer to write **male characters** as they are easier for me to portray, but do have a couple of female characters I could use. As for ships, I am currently looking for **MXM** and/or **MXF** pairings. I'm currently not interested in FXF pairings. NSFW content ***MUST*** be discussed beforehand as I am still very new to writing it. No matter what happens, I would like the ship (*should there be one*) to be a **slow-burn**.\n\n**Currently I am only looking for FANDOM RPs or particular Original RPs. I don't mind whether this is with Canon characters or OCs.**\n\n**Ground Rules and Expectations**\n\n1. **Be 18+ in age (Characters must also be 18+)**\n2. At least **2 detailed paragraphs** per reply.\n3. Decent grammar is a must. I understand that typos are a thing, but please use proper capitalization and punctuation in your responses.\n4. **3rd Person POV**\n5. Please be open to OOC conversation and chatter.\n6. I am looking for a **long term RP partner**, preferably for **multiple RPs**. They don\u2019t have to be with the same characters or the same world, so long as we are having fun.\n7. I **will not** do plots that are exclusively ERP. I would like to have a story that goes along with any NSFW content and I will not RP just straight up smut.\n8. When contacting me, please state your favorite movie/show so I know you read through the rules.\n\n**Genres**  \nThe following are a list of genres that I thoroughly enjoy. Those that are bolded are ones I am especially looking for at the current moment. Please note that these favorites can be changed around and just because something isn\u2019t bolded doesn\u2019t mean I am completely against RPing said genre.\n\n* Medieval\n* Fantasy\n* **Angst / Dark Themes**\n* **H/C**\n* Drama\n* **Romance**\n* Slice of Life\n* **Fandom** (see below)\n\n**Fandoms**  \nAt the current time, Fandom RPs are preferred to Original RPs. Below is a list of fandoms I would like to RP, the characters I would like to play, and the ships I prefer for each. Keep in mind that my fandom tastes do shift and may not always be constant. Furthermore, please feel free to come forth with other fandom ideas if you are curious.\n\n**Please note that those with two dots (\u2022\u2022) are fandoms I am especially looking for at the moment and the asterisk (\\*) is by characters I really wish to play.**\n\n* **DC (Animated and Cinematic Universe) \u2022\u2022**\n   * Bruce Wayne (Batman) \\*\n   * Clark Kent (Superman) \\*\n   * Richard Grayson (Nightwing) \\*\n   * Damian Wayne (Robin)\n   * Tim Drake (Red Robin)\n   * Koriand\u2019r (Starfire)\n   * Lois Lane\n   * Barry Allen (haven't seen CW)\n   * OCs  \n\n      * Ships: **Clark Kent x Lois Lane**, Bruce Wayne x Catwoman, **Clark Kent x Bruce Wayne**, **Koriand\u2019r x Richard Grayson**, **Tim Drake x Kon-El / Conner, Damian Wayne x Jon Kent (aged up), Damian Wayne x Raven (aged up),** Barry Allen x Hal Jordan, OC x OC  \n\n* **Avatar: The Last Airbender \u2022\u2022 / Legend of Korra**\n   * Zuko \\*\n   * Sokka\n   * Katara\n   * Asami\n   * OCs \\*\n      * Ships: Aang x Katara, **Katara x Zuko, Zuko x Sokka, Sokka x Toph**, Korra x Asami, Platonic Iroh and Zuko,  **OC x OC**  \n\n* **The Man From Uncle \u2022**\n   * Napoleon Solo \\*\n   * Illya Kuryakin\n   * OCs \\*\n      * Ships: **Napoleon Solo x Illya Kuryakin, Illya Kuryakin x Gabby Teller, OC x OC**  \n\n* **Marvel (Animated and Cinematic Universe)**\n   * Tony Stark (Iron Man) \\*\n   * Clint Barton (Hawkeye) \\*\n   * Steve Rogers (Captain America) \\*\n   * Peter Quill (Star Lord) \\*\n   * OCs\n      * Ships: Tony Stark  x Pepper Potts, **Tony Stark x Steve Rogers**, Steve Rogers x Bucky Barnes, **Thor x Star Lord**, **Clint Barton  x Natasha Romanoff**, Loki x Tony Stark, Tony Stark  x Stephen Strange  \n\n* Other **minor plots** (with no specific plans thus far) I am currently interested in outside of fandoms would be the following:\n   * Company CEO / Employee\n   * Gentleman Spies *(Think Kingsmen or Man From Uncle)*\n   * Cop or Civilian / Crimelord\n\n**Conclusion**  \nSo while this wasn\u2019t a quick rundown of my preferences, I hope you made it to the end.

            "selftext": " \n\nHey! My name is Maple and I am looking for a roleplay partner who is alright with doing a self insert/oc x canon roleplay with me, with said partner playing as the canon character. I can Also play as a certain character for my roleplay partner and we could have two different roleplays going on at the same time\n\nI mainly do a mix of horror , romance and angst with some gore/violence/action if my roleplay partner is okay with it or not. I roleplay in a semi-literate and detailed style and would prefer if my partner did so as well.\n\nI am in a lot of fandoms, but the main ones I would like to roleplay include Corpse party, your turn to die, angels of death, and thats it! I am willing to send wiki page links about characters if you are unfamiliar with the fandom, I don't usually roleplay inside canon universes anyways! - I can also play as a character I don't know for my partner as long as you send me info about the character.\n\nplease keep in mind that I am on the autism spectrum, so please be patient with me! And if interested, DM me and I will give my discord info so we can talk more there!",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone! It's been a while, honestly- and I've been pretty bored recently so I'm searching for some people to rp with.  I've been unable to post on this subreddit for a bit? Like it would let me post, however, it would not show up on the subreddit and no one would see it- so let's see what happens now!  \n\n\nIm not looking for anything TOO complex- I just need something to do and some pretty chill and fun partners to rp with!  \n\n\nI am a pretty literate rper- I write multiple paragraphs and am a sucker for detail just because I enjoy writing a lot... however- I am QUITE flexible with reply lengths! I am a firm believer in quality over quantity, so if you put effort in, I don't care about how much you write! I just need something decent to keep a good story going and keep it fun.  \n\n\nSo for genres- I'm open to a lot of different genres! However, I prefer to do something in a sort of modern universe, maybe Slice-of-life but combined with action and drama to keep it interesting. However, I am NOT looking for romance rps, I prefer to explore other relationships because the characters I want to use are already together. I also do not do 18+ smutty stuff, however, I am open to sort of vulgar language and more 18+ themes, and I'm also open to darker themes as long as they aren't put in there just to be unnecessarily edgy, ya know?  \n\n\nPlots- i'm open! Usually I enjoy discussing plots with my partners, just because I wanna find something that interests us both and we both can have fun with, however if you don't have one I can try to think of something! I only have one very flexible plot, which we can fill in the details for when we start talking!\n\nI'm open to all different kinds of characters! I don't care about gender, race, sexuality, religions, etc.- literally they can be anyone! I might just prefer for them to be human- just because all my characters and the ones I usually use are human- and also, I prefer them to be 18+ because my characters are over 18- however once again I am flexible, and this all can be discussed! I have art of my characters, usually, so I do ask if you are okay with drawn out characters- I have full reference sheets and all! I do not mind how you show me your characters, whether they are drawn, realistic, even an anime face claim- or you can just give me a description! I am once again flexible.  \n\n\nannnd lastly, I prefer to rp over Discord- because it is much much easier for me to keep track of and all, since the reddit app barely works on my cellphone for some reason? (my phone is hella old), however I can use Discord everywhere I go. So that is what I prefer! We can talk in pms here, exchange discord tags, and go over there! Whatever you sort of prefer-  \n\n\nAnd I think that is it! If you got any more questions, I'll answer, so comment or pm me and we can get talking! Hopefully, this post can be seen and I get to rp with yall soon!",

            "selftext": "\nYo!\n\nI'm Ink, I've been roleplaying for many years, and have been into Naruto for longer. Actually, Naruto is the fandom that got me into roleplaying. My writing has improved significantly since those middle school days, but unfortunately not my humor. I've also shipped SasuSaku for just as long. \n\nCurrently, I'm looking for someone to write Sakura to my Sasuke! And in return, I'm willing to write just about any character in any pairing -- even CanonxOC, doesn't have to be canon compliment, and can be any gender pairing.\n\nA bit about me as a writer, what I'm looking I'm for, and what you can expect:\n\n--**DETAIL:** Depending on the scene, how many characters are involved, and generally what\u2019s going on, my posts can range anywhere from a minimum of 300 words to 1000+. I firmly believe in quality &gt; quantity, so I necessary don\u2019t expect my partner to match my length.\n\n--**COMMUNICATION:** I\u2019m perfectly fine with, even enjoy, OOC chatter. Also, as with all human interactions, I believe communication is needed for smooth sailing. Not having fun? Did something make you uncomfortable? Did you not understand something in my post, or did I accidentally misunderstand yours? Got an interesting idea to add to the story? Let me know! I\u2019ll always more than willing to work things out.\n\n--**ACTIVITY:** This will most likely be a bit sporadic on my side. While some days (depending on the length of my replies) I might be able to post a few times a day, others I will only be able to do one, and it might turn out that I\u2019m only able to fit a one post in a particular week. I understand life comes first, will not pressure my partner to reply, and ask for patience in return.\n\n--**RP Platform:** I prefer for the roleplay to take place over Discord, but can be convinced to do email or gdocs.\n\n\n**A Few Ideas:**\n\n--Something set during Sasuke and Sakura's post-canon travels (more indepth plot available).\n\n---Mafia/Yakuza AU\n\n--Non-Massacre AU, where Itachi and Shisui are still alive.\n\n--Feudal Japan AU.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you!",

            "selftext": "Hey,\n\nI am back here looking for literate partners whom I could roleplay with. I have two plots that I wish to roleplay with but I am completely open to listening in to your suggestions on my plots, your own ideas and anything you want to try.\n\nYou might have seen similar plots and the reason why I am posting from a new account is that I forgot the password to my old account and decided to start again! \n\nI am 21 years old and will not roleplay with minors. Also, I am okay with a few NSFW elements in the plot and we can further discuss that when you reach out to me.\n\nAs for the Original Plots that I want to share- I have a few. They are extremely different from one another but there is a lot that can be done with the plot. I will also mention the fandoms I am in so that we can come up with fandom based plots for the roleplay as well. \n\n______________________________________\nMy Plots:\n\n\nPlot 1: Opposites Attract.\n\nNate the character that you will play is a little narcissistic and superficial. He's tall, popular and has a temper issue.He is sculpted by God. He has been in a long relationship with Maddi, who is very bipolar and toxic. But he is no less. He used to think that Maddy was it for him. \n\nHe didn't have tattoos neither does he rebel by Breaking rules. He has the perfect grades and the perfect everything yet people fear him for once you're not on his good side, it's terrible to be on his bad side.\n\nEnter Belle. She is the polar opposite of Nate. She only knows Nate because of sharing a few classes with him but doesn't get in his way at all. She loves baking, cooking and dancing. She is bubbly. But there is one thing that she hides. She had been falling for Nate and everything he went to Maddy, he'd break her heart. She pretends to not react much to it by over indulging herself in other things and activities.\n\nBut when Nate gets to know of Belle's little crush, he starts pining for Belle and they have a small fling which is nothing official. He keeps going back to Maddy and that complicates the relationship between Belle and Nate.\n\nARRANGED MARRIAGE PLOT:\n\nThe world was on the brink of destruction and humanity had vanished from the phase of the planet. Fertility rates were at an all time low and life expectancy had gone down by three times. All the destruction and chaos cause by the Great War had its toll on the few survivors.\n\nBelle was one of them. She was just 23 years old and missed her life before the war, the bombings and the mass murders. She was the daughter of an affluent minister who had somehow paved his way through contacts and money to keep his family alive. But things had changed now.\n\nShe was expected to be married off to the modern day commander. These lines of commanders were responsible for the restructuring of the planet that they once lived on. They were known to be extremely loyal to the government and were cold hearted men- that's what a war does to men. \n\nBelle was married off to Steve, one such commander. He was higher in ranks compared to his colleagues. He was in his early 30s and was barely the person he was before the war took place. Belle was expected to marry him, hold his reputation up in the dystopian society  to make a family with him and to take care of him. \n_______________________________________________\n\nThese are some detailed plots that I would LOVE to play with anyone who is up for it. I love slow burn romances, unrequited love, drama and the likes of all that is very extra haha.\n\nI am obviously open to any suggestions or even creating a new plot with you! I hope to get some responses and I look forward to talking to you soon. xxx",

Its centered around the collapse and over throwing of a world setting up for the sequel and inevitable betrayal of all involved. Fun stuff can have some NSFW content but mostly just focusing on developing side characters myself. (So I will be playing various roles to polish them) With that in mind anything really goes i wont be putting much of this into the book but if i do I will ask first oh and all content is of coarse my brainchild lol but feel free to use whatever you feel fits. There are many God level characters or triple S class entities that work in the background as well, either way loads of fun for a long term writer who is looking for an interesting partner.",

Oh, and just so I know you read all the way through and didn\u2019t skim, include the password \u2018volcano\u2019. Please, be literate! Since this is a heavily detailed plot, I\u2019ll likely be writing several paragraphs per response, and I ask that you at least be able to keep up.

To match their current environment, incredible advancements in technology arose, able to generate faux atmospheres and ozone layers, letting humanity thrive on the now watery planet - but as humans generally are they wished for more, and they expanded into the deep corners of space, going from the Milky Way to the Andromeda Galaxy and even Messier 81. Now? Humans are everywhere, from this planet to that planet, and it was near impossible to escape. The aliens of science fiction were true, but only had a few key differences that made just slightly differed them from humans - such as flesh tone, pupils and eye count, specific tooth shapes and jawlines. And as humanity evolved, so did their entertainment. The gladiatorial joy found in bloodsports now were reintegrated into human culture, and it was, just like humanity, everywhere.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nHi! I hope your safe in your home from COVID-19. I\u2019m Galaxy, and I came up with a plot while half asleep doing assignments. As the title suggests, it\u2019s gladiatorial Nascar in space. The plot, in a neat package, is: Now that humanity is in space, they\u2019re bored, and make death row inmates, suicidal people, and washed up celebrities perform in a bloodsport called Gladiatorial Speeding. There is also League Speeding, which is just Gladiatorial Speeding without the death. Before I go further into detail, a few things about me.\n\n- 1) I am a pretty decent writer, but I\u2019m not perfect. Sometimes I will take a long while to reply but I assure you, I\u2019m still there coming up with something. Please be patient.\n\n- 2) I can write fairly long responses, from three to five paragraphs, but I can also write single paragraphs, two paragraphs and if you really wanted to, a just a few lines. I\u2019m maximum flexible, and I\u2019d really like to expand on this story here. \n\n- 3) I\u2019m in the United States, EST. Right now it\u2019s 2 AM. My only platform is unfortunately Discord.\n\nSo! If you\u2019re interested, send me a DM on Reddit for me to go deeper into detail and answer any of your questions and we can trade contact info. I\u2019ll reply back as soon as I can.\n\nSee you around!",

            "selftext": "**TL;DR:**\n\nI like a fantasy world, be it low or high fantasy. \n\nOne prompt is based off Minecraft and it would be a slow SoL survival type story. The other is a post-apocalyptic setting based off of a film (basically dragons appear and cause the apocalypse) where you would play a member of a settlement that has grouped together to try and better survive. \n\nI'm willing to hear other fantasy-based plots so message me if you have something interesting :)\n\nI'd like you to have a decent grasp on English and be willing to at least match response length. \n\nI roleplay on Discord. \n\n**About Me:**\n\nI'm an 18-year-old guy from the UK. I've been roleplaying for about 5 years, on and off mostly, but have recently found a bit more stability in my love of writing. I do work a full time job so it would be helpful if you can understand some days, I simply won't have the time to respond. I will always make time for an intriguing plot as best I can though.\n\n**About the Prompts:**\n\nThis idea is based heavily off another that I saw posted a few weeks ago here. I\u2019ve adapted it a little to suit myself but to the one who had the genius idea of combining these two: thank you.\n\n1)Based heavily off Minecraft but only in world and setting, not so much in the 'cubic world' sense. Night time dangers, different dimensions, the villagers and pillagers, the survival focus, the items and the general world. \n\nYou would play a character who has had her start in this world. She woke up on a beach one day with no memories and was fortunate enough to be found by a local villager and his son, who brought you home to nurse you to health. Since then you've made your own home, live in a comfortable routine and have aided the village in raids and the dangers of the night. This would be about the late iron stage of the game. Your character would have avoided magic and redstone elements in the same way the villagers had. Rumours of their evils fly around the village to ward off any ideas of storing ender pearls or even considering building a nether gate.\n\nYou would find my character on that same beach you appeared on. Taking me home in the same way you had been, the RP would start off with you teaching me the basics of this strange world.\n\nThis one is based off of a world and setting from a film that was \u2013 if I\u2019m honest \u2013 completely average. The title might be tripping the auto moderator soooo\u2026 bonus points for guessing what it was! \n\n2)The world 'ended' years ago, but not so long as that you cannot remember it as it once was. The creatures came and burned the cities to the ground, claiming them for themselves. The first onslaughts were brutal and unfathomable numbers of people were lost all across the world. You were one of the lucky survivors, even luckier when you found your way into a growing commune of people, living in a forest that sat between towns. You were covered enough to be unseen. Far enough from cities to be undisturbed. Close enough to towns to be able to scavenge for essentials and even luxuries. By all accounts and measures, your little settlement was thriving, with electricity from generators buried deep to muffle them and plenty of stored food and water. \n\nUnder your safety society is reborn. Against that are the smaller raiding bands that threaten your scavenger missions, worse than that, a few dragons have been seen in the area: fortunately, not close to your own settlement and nowhere near the sizes that own the cities. Your character would be a member of this settlement, one of the first at that: your word holds weight and you're respected. You frequently accompany scavenger missions to help keep them safe and make sure the right things are taken to help your fellow citizens. You rarely encounter any problems but are always at the ready. Feel free to make yourself  backstory and personality for this; I'm only trying to set up the foundations of a story.\n\nMy character would be one of the thorns in the side of the scav teams. A scavenger that steals scraps and weapons to try and survive on his own. Underneath that is a secret that he's been hiding to get the upper hand and maybe thrive in the way that you and your friends have.\n\n**About You:**\n\nI don't roleplay with people under 18, and I'd like you to at least be close to my age: about the 18 to 25ish range. \n\nI want this to be well written, so a decent grasp on English is required, but you don't need to be a New York Bestseller (lord knows I'm not).\n\nI work a fulltime job so would love a partner who can understand that no matter how dedicated to a plot I am, I might not be able to respond on some days.\n\nBe kind. Be engaged. Be open.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read all of this, feel free to message me via the chats to enquire towards the roleplay. After some intros and discussion on their I'll hand over my Discord name and we'll move it over there. I hope to hear from you soon. o/\n\nP.S. If my grammar is a little trash in this, blame Microsoft Word, their grammar and spelling checks aren\u2019t always the best xD",

I\u2019m looking for roleplayers that are male to Roleplay. I prefer any genre that isn\u2019t Slice of Life or \u201cSimple\u201d if that makes sense. Like roleplays that don\u2019t include drama and action but rather sitting on a couch watching Teletubbies, I don\u2019t do that.\n\nHere are some of my Requirements for Roleplaying, please understand that I\u2019m used to Discord so I may be a little out of trend.\n\ud83c\udf3c I am 18 years of age, so I\u2019d prefer someone 17+.\n\ud83c\udf38 I do not do any NSFW/ERP content. That is a no for me so please do not ask.\n\ud83c\udf3a Male Main Characters are a MUST! You may play Side Female Characters however your main must be male.\n\ud83c\udf3b I am someone who does QuickFire which means I reply quickly. I don\u2019t write a lot but can write up to a paragraph.\n\ud83c\udf37 I prefer to communicate through Discord until I fully learn about how to use a Reddit.\n\ud83c\udf39 Romance must be in the roleplays\n\nI have a few ideas but I\u2019d rather share them privately just to get you excited to Roleplay with me! \ud83d\ude04\n\nNow that\u2019s taken care of, I hope to see you in my private messages. If not, take care and thank you for reading and taking the time to see how weird I am. Have a fantastic day!",

            "selftext": "Hello! \n\nI'm currently looking for a partner who has a decent amount of time and heaps of enthusiasm. I've been roleplaying for an embarrassingly long time at this point and few things make me happier than really fleshing out a story with a fellow writer. If you want a partner who comes with ideas, writes quality posts, and will flood you with headcanons and ship songs -- it me. I'm also a ***huge*** fan of faceclaims and can even include icons with my posts, if you'd like! \n\nRight now, I've been **REALLY** craving some MCU play. I've got a bunch of ideas for both plots and characters from that universe. I'd even be open to writing multiple characters and tapping into the vastness of the franchise.  I'm also *super* into crossing over my main girl, Lara Croft, into that world. She fits in a shockingly well there.\n\nAnd speaking of Lara, I'm **always** up to write her; whether it be a different crossover or a completely original storyline. I've been literally roleplaying as her since I was eleven, (Embarrassing, I know.) But as dorky as that is, it also means that writing her is incredibly easy for me. Even on bad days, it's not hard for me to step into Lara's laced-up boots. I always have some plots for her lying around -- ranging from straight-up adventures to lighter, cuter romantic arcs. \n\nI enjoy plots with Lara more than anything else. I'll always perk up when someone wants to write opposite her; especially if their interest is more about her personality and history rather than her bombshell looks. She's a lot more interesting than people assume, in large part due to the hideous marketing of the Tomb Raider series in the past. Even if your knowledge of her is only in passing, that's not an issue. I **love** introducing roleplay partners to her. They tend to be pleasantly surprised. \n\nI've also been on a Star Trek binge, so I'd be down to brainstorm some plots set in that franchise. \n\nBut if you're prefer something completely original, I'm flexible! I tend to build characters to fit my partner's cravings. If there's a type of character you've been writing opposite or a faceclaim you've been wanting someone to use, please let me know! I'd also love to hear about any prompts you've been itching to do but haven't been able to find anyone for. \n\nAs for me, I like urban fantasy, crime, slice of life, post-apocalyptic, and so much more. Like I said, I've been roleplaying for ages and I'd like to think I'm pretty versatile in what I can write. \n\nI'm also open to incorporating NSFW elements into any of these prompts; but I'd prefer if it wasn't the main focus. I'm a big believer in plot before pleasure; and I want a partner who thinks similarly. \n\n**What I need you to be:** \n\n- Polite\n- Able to write in 3rd person.\n- Creative.\n- Enthusiastic. \n- Available on Discord.\n- Over the age of 21.\n\n---\n\n#Also, please **don't** reach out to me via Reddit Chat. I don't read them. I only check DM's. Thanks! ~ Cheers! &lt;3",

If you PM me, I can give you information and you can tell me if you feel comfortable/confident playing this celeb. There is required viewing/reading but it would all fall under about 2 hours total I wager.\n\n- I am happy to play a celeb for you, if you want me to double up in that sense. If you want me to double up as a celeb alongside my original character, please provide material for me to refer to so we're on the same page regarding information. All characters will be expected to be in their late 20s at least. \n\n- I'm not looking for someone who is just going to go through the motions without putting in effort into their role, especially if we're doubling up on celebs for each other.\n\n- I want to limit fanservice. I know people do these to fulfill a fantasy or daydream but I am looking to create a concrete story with development where not every event should center around my (or yours too) character. I want a balance of plot where things happen slowly. I'm not looking for a sudden infatuation, I want things to feel natural and I wager things may happen more slowly given these dynamics differ from a normal romance.\n\n**About me:**\n\nI write on discord and can give about 3 paragraphs on average, often more. I tend to write every couple of days because life is busy for me. That said, I love chatting with partners even if posts aren't flying off our keyboards so don't hesitate to reach out and gab.\n\nI enjoy cooking and baking and would love it if my partner shares that passion or maybe one for anime or video games. \n\nI work full-time and may be going back to school over the coming months. Real life stuff always comes first. But we gotta communicate any issues. Without it, we'll be spinning our wheels.\n\n**About the celeb:**\n\nI won't go into too much detail here but I will describe him as follows: He's quiet, contemplative, passionate, creative, thoughtful, determined, eloquent, rebellious and genuine.\n\nHe is a renowned chef. He survived cancer. He's kind of a mad genius. And I'd like to think he's kind of a dork at times.\n\n**Closing Notes:**\n\nPM me if you want to give this a go. If you want me to double up for you and your own character, tell me some info about what you have in mind. And we'll talk and see if we can get on the same page. :)",

I am searching for a literate and detailed roleplay partner, interested in creating an intricate and beautiful story together. I enjoy writing long and detailed posts, the maximum going up to three paragraphs. I do enjoy smut and nsfw themes in my Rp. \n\nAs far as original ideas versus fandoms go, I enjoy both with equal passion. I do have a few original ideas in my mind at the moment, but we can discuss your ideas as well. \n\nCurrently I am very much looking for a Smallville rp\n\nFandoms I enjoy are, but not limited to,\nWarhammer Fantasy\nDisney\nPixar\nDoctor who\nHarry Potter \nFirefly\nStar Trek \nStar Wars\nLord of the rings\nPirates of the Caribbean \nSkyrim\nFallout\nMarvel\nDC\nBig Bang Theory\n\nThere are a few other fandoms I like, but don\u2019t know a lot about. Such as mortal combat and soulcaliber. I also have a multitude of platforms to rp on, mostly discord. If this interests you, please private message me, or shoot me a normal message here on reddit. \n\nAnd have an amazing day!!",

I wanna do a bit of lengthy discussion about certain things before we rp so just message me and we\u2019ll get started! Also, have a picture of the Harley you\u2019re planning on playing, I\u2019d prefer it to be a real life or Arkham games picture rather than a animated one, if you don\u2019t have one, I\u2019ll get one!

I'm not any 1500 characters per literate but you know,,, I feel I do a fair amount.\n\nAnyways, my current roleplay partner of 2 years has been on Haitus and I got to thinking, maybe having a second roleplay partner wouldn't be too bad?\n\nThe only thing I ask is;\n- Don't use ** (or just be non lit- please be semi lit/literate)\n- I'd much rather you'd not use a face claim or steal some anime character off Google... You know it's very difficult for me to find a roleplay partner that has drawn OCs :\")\n- I'm kinda young. I'm a Freshman haha- now I'm perfectly comfortable conversing with anyone over 18. In fact I prefer the age gap since I'm more comfortable talking with people of an age gap since that's all I've ever done. It's hard to communicate with people my age sometimes. I'm also perfectly comfortable with NSFW stuff. We don't have too, but I ask you do take into consideration my age because I know most people on here are over 18 and uncomfortable talking to someone under that age.\n\nOther than that, I'm free to DM and we can elaborate more on what kind of roleplay we wish to do, our characters, and so on. I use Discord for Roleplay but I'm open to use Email, Docs, Amino, etc.",

            "selftext": "Hello there!\n\nI'm looking for something specific here. I would love to find someone to start a long-term roleplay with. I'm just talking about a slice-of-life thing, nothing crazy or bizarre or out there. We can absolutely work out the details and develop the scenario together; are we a newly-married couple, moving into our first real house? Are we a couple in college who have been dating for a few months and we've just moved in together for the first time? Maybe we've been together for a few years, and we start with the night we decide we want to try for a child? Or maybe we just start from our first date and get to know each other for real, going through all those other firsts in their own time! I'm up for any one of these, or, if you have a different idea, just say so! We can work together to figure out what we like.\n\nAs for the tone, I'd love for this to be simple, domestic, and intimate. But to me, those softer, quieter moments of developing a relationship are the context that gives the relationship meaning. I want to discuss interests before we start! I do want to discuss the idea of cheating/affairs! But of course, we can definitely discuss this stuff before we start; I want to make sure this is just as enjoyable for you as it is for me.\n\nA few other technical notes: I play in first person present tense, so I hope that's okay. I'm also definitely looking for someone who is detailed and descriptive, preferably writing in between 1-3 paragraphs (though of course some responses require a lot of writing and some not so much, we can feel all that out, I'm not a stickler).\n\nIn short, I'm looking for a simple, sweet, intimate slice-of-life roleplay with someone who's looking for something similar; something regular and consistent where we can both unwind together and build the scenario together over time. If you're interested in that, let me know! Hope to hear from you soon :)",

I have both Kik and discord and like to roleplay on both, my name is Lila and I'm a 21-year-old female.  \nI'm into any type of roleplaying but tend to lean more towards fantasy or science fiction with a little bit of a romantic twist on it. I am looking for someone older than 18 because my scenes can be violent and graphic and sometimes a little sexual. I want someone who doesn't want to write a basic story, I want drama, passion, and mystery in my roleplay so if you are a basic writer I don't know if our styles will be compatible.   \nI also want someone who can match my length and not just give a few words and think the story will go off of that. I am ok with writing in the 3rd or 1st person but I do enjoy the 1st a little more.    \nSo if you'd like to see where our minds could take us lets dive in.",

Just looking to see if anyone might be interested in an Umbrella Academy RP (with OCs - maybe some of the other kids that didn't get scooped up by Hargreeves) through Discord.\n\nI'm looking for someone around my age (early 30s). I've been RPing on and off since my teens. I just love writing, and writing alone gets a bit lonely, especially with #quarantinelife going on. Usually 3-4 paragraphs per post unless the situation is just demanding of something more rapid fire, but I'm not going to nitpick your post length or anything. I can usually post at least once per day. No smut/NSFW at all. If characters find those sorts of relationships, then it's fade to black time. Violence, action, adventure, adult themes; that's all fine.\n\nThanks friends! Please, Private Messages only if you're interested. I won't respond to chat requests. Bonus for those who enjoy some choice OOC chat. ;)\n\nSide note... If you have other ideas, I might be down. Let me know what you're interested in!",

I'd mostly like if you had a sort of \"bright eyed bushy tail\" sort of attitude with hoping to impress her, and show off. I'd like that sort of dynamic with a relationship between the two of us, one trying to win over the other while the other remains mostly unamused.\n\nYou don't need to know too much about Monster Hunter to do this, but if you do, I'm basing this off Monster Hunter World if you need to know. Nothing much else to it, if you're not interested in playing the personality I offered, feel free to offer up another. We can always chat, and work something out. \n\nI don't expect too too much from my partner, just try to match how much I'm writing. I am not completely consistent with my post lengths, but I keep nice detail, and info in them; Enough to get what I'm trying to say through without being unbearably short, or long. Not gonna do what everyone else does, and talk about my experience or however many years I've done this; it's kind of unnecessary, and boastful if you ask me. I know how to write, and please a partner is basically all you need to know about me.\n\nIf you're interested, feel free to send me a message, or start a direct chat here on Reddit.

            "selftext": "Yeah, not like the earth floods and we gotta save the animals two by two type dealio. I\u2019m talking more loosely based on the video game Ark where the survivors wake up on a deserted island inhabited by dinosaurs and prehistoric birds, mammals, etc. survivors have no or very little memory of life before the Ark. Everyday is a struggle for the most basic resources and survival is never guaranteed. If you are unfamiliar with the game that is fine! All you need to know is it\u2019s a survival game where you live on an island and can tame, kill, or be killed by dinosaurs and other creatures. \n\nAs for my preferred writing style! I prefer 3rd person past tense as that is what I write. I tend to lean toward multiple paragraph novella style posts, but so long as you can try to give me 2-3 paragraphs I should be happy. \n\nHonestly I\u2019m very laid back and like to get to know my partner outside the role play. I want to build a friendship while we build an epic fantasy world together. I want to exchange our most fun and absurd ideas and work to make our wildest plots come true. This will be a huge open world with tons of possibilities. \n\nI can play either Male or Female and can often double as well. I am over 18 and require my writing partners be so as well. I have very few limits and as there are high romantic elements to this RP, I am open to NSFW content. As far as darker themes, violence, etc, I am open and can discuss limits later when the time arrives. \n\nIf this all sounds fun or you would like more information please send me a PM! Thank youuuu!",

            "selftext": "Hey everyone here is my ad for a rp partner. So I have been playing a lot of video games recently trying to cram all that I can in before my college starts again and I\u2019ve been feeling the need to start an rp for a few. I am hoping to start one or two plots in the Fallout Universe, or the Gears universe. \n\nFallout- I am hoping to start a rp about a new character I have created for the FO4 game. I want to play as an 18 man who the Sole Survivor found deeper in Vault 111. I have three characters that I can try for this.  You would play as either Lucy Abernathy(depending on what character intrigues you) or as a settler in one of the communities that the Survivor established. \n\nGears of War- This one I am hoping to play as our own OCs for a rp. I am open to what era we begin in. Though I would love to start one in the Swarm Wars. The plot for that would be our squad is tasked to defend a potential settlement site. The DeeBees are running low from the escalating war so that\u2019s why we are chosen to defend this site. We must withstand horde upon horde to ensure our victory. \n\nA little about me is that I am 20 y/o and have been rp for about a year now. I like to consider myself a literate writer and despise writing in the first person. That\u2019s not to hate on those kinds of writers that\u2019s just me. Personally I found that it makes me lazy and makes me write only one sentence at a time. Please know that I use Discord for my RPs because I find it clean and neat. Thanks for reading now Would You Kindly respond.",

I absolutely adore writing and coming up with fictional plots and characters, and am very interested in getting involved in RPing.\n\nI\u2019m looking for someone who is also younger, preferably a teen as well (just because I feel like  it\u2019s kinda creepy and iffy to talk to legal adults over the internet as a minor\u2014always gotta be cautious, y\u2019know?), and experienced and able to deal with me learning how to RP the right way.\n\nI\u2019m into RPing whatever, so long as it\u2019s either a world that\u2019s entirely new and made up, or a fictional universe that I know about.",

I\u2019ve had a couple really good partners, but either they have forgotten our story, or real life has pulled them away. So I need someone who is able to be active and responsive. 18+ as plot may go into the NSFW area. Discord ONLY. THIRD PERSON PAST TENSE ONLY. Quality over quantity. Some situations might be detailed in a paragraph or less, or some responses may only require a couple sentences. My partner can be male or female, as long as you know the character is male. I use celebrity face claims, and other visual aids to enhance the plot. If you need a face claim, let me know, I can suggest some.\n\n\n\n***Idea***\n\nA group of ambassadors have gone to a small war torn country. It\u2019s dangerous, but the bosses think that the ambassadors can work their magic and calm the upset. It works...sort of. The more peaceful people are friendly and welcoming, but there are some more radical groups who threaten the shaky truce that the ambassadors have built so far. Eventually a larger more confident and violent group of radicals try to push their way into the peaceful village the ambassadors are staying. Fearing their safety, political leaders of the US have decided to send in a S.E.A.L. Team in to protect the ambassadors, and possibly extract them if needed. Romance blossoms between my character and a member of the team.",

            "selftext": "I saw a post earlier today that gave me a cute plot idea! The plot is two friends since high school, both not straight at all, have been hanging out/having sleepovers for their entirety of their teenage years. Neither was ever out to their parents, but because it was assumed they were of the same gender, no one questioned them spending so much time together. Now, high school is over and they\u2019re both living their lives and have to find ways to come to terms with the fact that they have genuine feelings for one another, instead of pretending they were just messing around in school.\n\nI am a 24 year old writer so I am looking for people 18+ who are NSFW positive and preferably part of the LGBTQ+ community. This is a plot focused around a queer relationship, however, their genders don\u2019t necessarily matter, so man, woman, non conforming, etc. are all welcome. I use real person faceclaims and write exclusively over Discord. I can bust out a few sentences per reply, so long as I am given something to work with.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in this plot or would like to flesh it out further, shoot me a message or leave a comment below!",

I have a flair for the dramatics in a roleplay, and like it to involve some angst, suspense, rivalry and a little dash of humour here and there. This isn\u2019t to say I strictly stick to darker themes, but they\u2019re what I\u2019m more experienced in! \n\nHow I work?\nI am definitely more inclined to do M/M at the moment, I find it a much more interesting dynamic to explore for a variety of reasons\u2014but that doesn\u2019t mean I won\u2019t consider M/F! I use Discord and I think I write decently well (stroking my ego), and usually go for a few paragraphs a reply. I can go smaller or larger depending on what you like. \n\nIdeas I have? \nI am really into crime, as always. I like writing gangsters and kingpins against undercover cops, at the moment I\u2019d say I\u2019m leaning more toward a tropical location/island setting (weird I know) or a stalker-ish theme, or maybe exploring some psychologically damaged ideas. \n\nMy roleplays can tend to lean into slice of life once the initial drama of a planned event is over, which I don\u2019t mind. I love exploring romantic relationships between characters so that is also more than welcome!\n\nP.S: I do do fandoms, I\u2019ll list some I know here for you lot who care more for that stuff: Hannibal, Peaky Blinders, Star Wars movies, Marvel, Batman films, Sherlock (movies and show).

            "selftext": "Hello everyone! Of course, this quarantine is really having me bored of myself and I'm just looking for some new people to chat with and, of course, rp with!  \n\n\nSo, my name is Gerard, but you can also call me Gee. I live in the EST time zone, however, I usually tend to stay up all weird hours of the night through the morning haha. I've been rping for years now... I'd probably say 6 or so- or almost 6- and I enjoy it very very much. I'm just looking for something fun to do, ya know? I love to write stories and share/discuss ideas!  \n\n\nSo what exactly am I looking for? Nothing *too* complicated, just something pretty casual however still very interesting and once again- fun for the both of us, because nobody likes a boring rp haha.  \n\n\nI am a semi-literate to advanced literate roleplayer, and honestly I tend to really enjoy writing a pretty decent amount just because I'm a sucker for details and everything. However, I am very flexible with the length of replies, honestly, I'm very much quality over quantity and as long as we give each other something good to work with, it's fine with me!  \n\n\nFor genres, I mainly am looking for stuff in the modern, slice of life sort of category- just because that is what I enjoy doing the most. Not only will it be slice of life, but also I love to combine that genre with action, comedy, drama- all that to keep it super interesting! I am not looking for anything really romantic... and that's just because the two characters I enjoy using are already together, so I would like to sort of explore other kinds of relationships in the rp (platonic, enemies, etc.).  \n\n\nI am not a *huge* fan of 18+ like... smutty content, no thank you- Yet I am open to more 18+ themes and all, like I don't mind swearing or somewhat adult humor, or even mentions of more adult things, however I just don't wish to... rp that kinda thing, ya know? I also have literally no triggers- but please share yours with me because I want you to be comfortable at all times!  \n\n\nFor plots- I do have one we can use! If you have one you'd like to share, awesome! I'm totally open to ideas and discussing. The \"plot\" I have is just a sort of basic outline or idea we can build off anyways, so that is flexible and free to add more to it!\n\nI am very open to all different kinds of characters! All genders, sexualities, races, all that- however I just prefer for them to be human and also over 18 (just because my characters are over 18). Besides that- I am okay with a lot! I personally have my characters drawn, so just be alright with that- but I don't really care how you want to show me your character; if you also have them drawn, if you have a faceclaim, just a description- I'm okay with all that!  \n\n\nAnd lastly- I just prefer to rp over discord- that's just because Reddit literally refuses to work on my phone, however I am able to use the discord app wherever I go. We can either rp through pms, or on a server- I don't mind! I just prefer to use Discord either way because it works the best for me and I don't wanna leave you guys hanging haha.  \n\n\nBut yep! I believe that is all- if you have any more questions, definitely don't be afraid to ask! I can't remember everything sometimes. But don't be afraid to comment or pm me if you are interested! I'll get to you ASAP and we can start discussing!",

We'll be able to roleplay canon and OCs so someone who can do multiple.\n\nI want it to take place right after the most recent season. A literate partner is preferred, paragraphs and such. I'm not for one liners so be aware of that.\n\nI'm also looking for 18+ as I tend to do gore and romance rps as well.\n\nIf your interesred please dm me! It'll be on discord.",

Just to get some things out of the way:\n\n- I\u2019m Jenny, i\u2019m a twenty-two year old female in the US.\n- I rp in a third-person, literate, multi-paragraph (2-4) style and I prefer you would do the same.\n- I would ask that my partner has some input into the RP, no matter how small. Don\u2019t be afraid to suggest things!\n- Romance, NSFW topics, and ERP are all good in my book.\n- Again, PLEASE feel free to have input.  I love crafting stories but all ideas are good ones! I want to make this an enjoyable experience for the both of us, with neither carrying the weight of the plot/characters. It\u2019s just a hassle attempting to create a world without the others input/help in making it, yknow?\n- I\u2019d also ask that my partner would take some control over NPC\u2019s/other characters.  We don\u2019t need to make them a major part of the story, and i\u2019m not asking that you take a whole character under your wing, but some help fleshing out the world would be greatly appreciated!\n\nAlright, with that out of the way, i\u2019ll get to brass tacks.\n\nDo you have pent-up anger? Do you hate the situation you\u2019re in, but can do nothing about it? Do you want to make yourself known? Come to No Man's Land, the premier location for treasure hunters and sadists alike!\n\nThe year is 2123.  The Earth has turned from a cultural centerpiece to ash and ice, scattered remains of human civilization dotting every corner of the globe.  Humans are still alive and well, although they now reside on planets besides their former home. However, scavengers and prospectors have begun to re-search the Earth, finding precious materials to sell and auction off on their home planets, the most popular of which being gold.\n\nThe booming success of the first wave of scavengers only furthered the idealistic thoughts of the masses, companies beginning to sponsor search parties and smaller groups in turn for profit from their expeditions. The media began to notice as well, making a small media conglomerate to view the \u2018participants\u2019 of this event, eventually making a full-on show from it.  \n\nThe name of the show is No Man\u2019s Land, where the only rule is there are no rules.  Participants are allowed to maim, murder, and punish any other scavengers in any way they like.  Not all scavengers are participants in the show, but they can be selected to premiere on the program if they prove to be interesting enough.",

            "selftext": "Hello there, it\u2019s been a while since I wrote a roleplay with someone and I have an itch to scratch when it comes to writing so I thought I would dive back into the roleplay world with someone. Before I start going on I should mention that I\u2019m in CEST timezone (GMT +2) just so you know, though timezones is not a problem for me.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI have always loves sci-fi and cyberpunk stories and would love to find someone else to write a story that takes place within one of those settings or a mix of both. So to be honest I don\u2019t have a fully setup story idea or something like that though I have some ideas for setting to start off with and we can go from there:\n\n* One setting is that the story takes place on a giant city planet (like Coruscant from Star Wars) what kind of characters we are on said planet we can discuss, though I like the idea of two people from different sides working together for some reason (like gang member and police, some kind of racer helping the police or an idea of yours.)\n\n* Another setting/start is a pair of people that is on the hunt for a treasure that is hidden on a planet somewhere in space.\n\n\n\nSo those are the two kinds of setting and starts I have at the moment though I can come up with more but I would love to hear you ideas too.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo when it comes to the writing, I write mostly in first person and present tense. As for writing length it differs for me depending on what is going on in the story at the moment sometimes I will write more and sometimes less depending on what is going on.\n\nSo if you are a Sci-fi and/or Cyberpunk story lover then send me a message here on reddit and we can see what kind of story we can get up too.",

I\u2019m currently looking for a roleplay based on the game \u201cSpiritfarer!\u201d I\u2019m 19 years old, so I do prefer someone over 18, however I\u2019m not interested in doing anything nsfw in this roleplay. \n\nI am a lit, multi-para writer. I\u2019m a very communicative person, so I\u2018ll tell ya whenever I can\u2019t post for awhile. This also means that I like to talk OOC, so let\u2019s be friends. But, no pressure of course.\nI also really like worldbuild. Just because the world is sorta set doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t have our own little twists. Just throw any ideas you have at me, and we can go as far as we\u2019d like to.\n\nAs far as the roleplay goes, it\u2019s gonna follow the game pretty closely. Basically the spiritfarer finds lost spirits around the world using their ship and...fares them to the Everdoor when they no longer have any baggage back in the mortal plane.\n\nI\u2019m gonna say it right now, I definitely want to play as a/the spiritfarer. Selfish, I know. But, I just love the concept so much that I just have to make a character exploring that.\n\nHowever, you can play as whatever ya want! Maybe you want to play as a spirit unraveling their past so they can move on to the next world in peace, OR, you could play as a co-Spiritfarer. I mean, a spiritfarer could definitely use a buddy that sticks around while their query dies left and right.\n\nThe sky\u2019s the limit!\n\nIf interested or have any questions, just DM me for my discord user. \n\nHope to see you soon!",

            "selftext": "Heavily inspired by a rather niche visual novel, I'm looking to build/expand a medieval fantasy world ruled by the seasons: four prominent households all vying for power after the royal family disappeared during an assassination attempt many years ago. Each House is represented by one of the seasons, and it was a prince of the House of Winter that was accused of the conspiring against the royal family and beheaded as punishment. As a result, Winter was disgraced and their involvement in the governance of the kingdom and all related matters was prohibited from then on. Simply associating with them will do you no favours in court. This was also the start of an endless winter beyond the capital's walls.\n\nGenerations later, there is still some small hope that the heir will return and the long winter will finally end. A young woman living in a small village in the wilds receives an invitation to the capital, where she will discover that she is apparently a princess of Spring and that she is betrothed to the prince of Summer. Summer has suspicions that she is an heir to the royal family and are looking to capitalise on that before the other Houses can, and things take a dangerous turn. On the way to the capital, she also encounters an infamous highwayman who is revealed to be the last prince of Winter, and is more intrigued by how he changes from cold and distant nobleman to charming outlaw.\n\nI'm looking to play the heir opposite the prince of Winter. The prince has turned his back on the court in favour of wine, women and masquerading as an infamous vigilante, and he does not let anyone get close because of the stigma surrounding his family, so I'm aiming for this to be a slow burn. I'm also open to reworking some or all of this plot and/or characters, and I welcome any additions to it if any potential partners have their own ideas!\n\nJust a few other things you might like to know before contacting me:  I'm 21+, so ideally looking for partners that are at least 18; I write in third person and multiple paragraphs per post; and I prefer to roleplay over email (can be persuaded to use other platforms, just not Discord). \n\nSo if that sounds like something you may be interested in, feel free to drop me a message!",

I\u2019m open to play either Harley or Ivy but I prefer Harley, as far as ideas I\u2019m mostly thinking scale back the stakes to a level similar to the beginning of season one but I\u2019m definitely not afraid to rise them as we go on, I just think we need solid ground to ge your barring you know? I\u2019m not picky at all with story and I am open to your ideas if you have any regardless of genre, so whatever it is, comedy, romance, action, slice of life whatever it is I\u2019m open to hearing it, and if you don\u2019t really have any idea we could totally work together to brainstorm something up. I hope to get some messages and maybe try something out with some of you wonderful people, thank you for reading and for your consideration",

We also talk in a separate channel not meant for role-playing, so we can make friends and send memes.\nStory so far after arc 1, everyone is living their best lives after poisoned river water threatened the entire area where each territory is and all the wolves came together to fix it, with the help from the werewolves.\nWolves don't like werewolves cause they're a freak of nature...
