I\u2019m also only looking to rp with other adults.\n\nHere\u2019s a bunch of ideas for very open ended plots...\n\n- A changeling is hired to look like the other characters lover who\u2019s passed on, though as time goes on the character begins to fall for the changeling themselves. Could also do something else along those lines.\n\n- A demon lord, strong enough to where they have fought against archangels has turned themselves into the hunter society, asking to be held there, the talented hunter put in charge of them finds themselves curious and talkative rather then scared.\n\n- The owner of a flower shop/cafe combo is rumored to have a secret item you can order, in which they\u2019ll lead you to a secret place in the shop and in exchange for something they\u2019ll make all your wishes come true. Your character finds themselves having to work for this witch.\n\nIf interested please message me with your name/username, the plot and pairing you\u2019re interested in as well as typing out a response to the following prompt so I can get an idea for your writing style:\n\nYour character is laying awake at night, thinking about something that had happened during the day, when suddenly they hear a sound coming from down the hall.",

It doesn't need to be super intense or super weird, it could just be something really oddly specific. The idea can be as detailed or as vague as you want.

            "selftext": "Hey, thanks for reading! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I have a starter for a pretty cliche Mafia style arranged marriage set in present day Chicago. The female protagonist seems to have an air of innocence and naivety to her in the starter, almost a victim to the figurative shackles that confine her to her current world. However, beneath the surface she's actually quite strong, resourceful and crafty. Her innocence will protect her, but knowing too much will make her a valuable target for enemies.\n\nI haven't flushed out the entire plot, I was looking for someone who is a strong, detailed writer to partner up with and develop this world, but the idea is to take this pairing and highlight their strengths and weaknesses. Having two characters recognize that their strengths or emotions could eventually be what kills them killed (falling for one another could mean a target on the other's back, knowing too much could be deadly). There are a lot of twists and turns we could take, and I have a million ideas running through my head that I'd love to flush out with someone.   \n\n\nWhat I'm looking for: \n\n* Someone detailed orientated\n* Active (a post a day would be ideal) \n* Multi-paragraph. \n* World building\n* Ability to creatively add to the story on the fly. \n* 18+ , preferably 25+ \n* Communication \n* Google-docs, E-mail or discord\n* Ability to play multiple characters\n* Desire to flesh out a plot\n* NSFW is accepted, but not expected \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you're interested, let me know! I'd love to chat and I would be happy to send the starter your way to see if it's something you're interested in. Keep in mind, it's the starter of a novel, so there is a lot of room for creativity on the male protagonist side, by no means will the character have to fit the 'mold' the starter seems to set forth.",

If you're interested, DM me with your entry.\n\n-//-\n\nGwen walked calmly through the school halls, towards the boys dorm block. Girls were not allowed in there, but she couldn't care less. The blonde winked to a friend, who was sneaking out of one of the rooms. Apparently, she wasn't the only one who liked to feel the thrill of visiting her boyfriend on his room.\n\nShe had been dating Miles for a few months now. Things had been flowing so naturally between them, they didn't even have to went through the awkward \"hey, wanna be my girlfriend\" conversation. They knew each others parents already, and their relationship couldn't be more stable.\n\nBut she suspected that something was wrong. Almost every night, he went out to do something in the city, which he called a \"part time job\". But she wasn't so sure. Gwen wasn't a jealous person. She knew Miles more than anyone else, and she was sure that he would never cheat on her, but after all these months, there was definitely something wrong.\n\nThe blonde knew he always went out exactly on 6PM, and she was ready to question him until he spilled the truth out.\n\nExactly at 5:58, she sneaked towards his room, and opened the door without knocking.",

I generally respond in a literate, multi-paragraph format.\n\nRight now, I'm looking to do a medieval, fantasy, sci-fi or cyberpunk themed roleplay. I did not have a set plot or idea in mind, as I would like this to be a collaboration between us, but some of the genres I love delving into involve action, adventure, thriller, and angst/grit. Therefore, I'm extremely flexible on all ideas and would be happy to work with you to build something we can both enjoy.\n\nAlso, if you do show interest, please commit to starting something. I don't want my time wasted, nor do I want to waste yours.\n\nI do have some requirements for partner\n\n\u00b7 21+ please\n\n\u00b7 Ability to write detailed responses in a multi-para format\n\n\u00b7 Strong literacy/writing skills\n\n\u00b7 Be open to exploring mature/dark themes. I do like to include smut in my roleplays as well.\n\nI do have Discord or email for this, whatever works best for you. I hope to hear from you soon!",

I also created my own team of super heroes known as Heroes Force that takes place before and during WW2.\n\nI have always seen people who roleplay online and I would love to start doing this. But I have no idea how to do this. Like how do I interact with villains and other players in text mode. Is there a Dm? I am looking for someone to help me learn. Someone who doesnt mind taking the time to help me get better. Maybe we start a RP after that. Maybe we become friends. I am open for male or female as long as they dont mind helping me learn.\n\nThanks for advance for this :)",

            "selftext": "\n\n\nI am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+\n\nRecently I have been really into watching supernatural beings movie. I've just finished watching Van Helsing and Dracula 2000. I would like to come up with a story together whether it's we hunt immortals, vampire and human, werewolf and human, or even vampire and werewolf. You may suggest any other creatures you'd like to play but that's just an idea.\n\nI don't want this story to be smut focus, this will be story driven and focus on the plot. I am a very detailed person and I at least write a paragraph or longer. Please don't send one liners as it won't be interesting to roleplay. I mainly roleplay in third but if you are first person then we can do first person.\n\nHere is an idea of how I write: (please do not steal!)\n\n\"Trevor?\" A soft voice called, a women with long dark brown hair and bright blue eyes started down the hallway of the Belmont manor. Her worry eyes travels around until she heard voices. Her eyebrows furrowed in confusion as she stopped at a large door to which she recognized leads to the ball room. She pressed her hands to the double doors and opened them as they lightly creaked in need for a bit of oil.\n\n\"Tre-\" she began but stopped as her eyes widens in fright at the horrid scene before her. \n\nHer hands flew to her mouth as an unknown man with jet black, a bit pass the shoulders hair,  had pierced a cross like weapon, with the longer side inside the chest of her husband. Her voice shook out as a hand immediately flew to her six month pregnant belly of her first child. She took small steps back as Trevor turned his head, looking at his wife with blood spilling from his lips.\n\n\"Ru..n..\" he surprisingly spoke out as if it was his last words. \n\nEvelyn took no chance as she sprinted down the hall, almost tripping over her dress. Her eyes held panic in them as they darted around for somewhere to hide, spotting the room her and Trevor spend most of their time in: the family room. She looked around, deciding to hide in the closet, behind a bunch of coats. She sat down and pressed her hands against her lips to keep herself quiet. Distant footsteps began to approach until they became louder and louder towards the room she was in. Her eyes stared through the small cracks of the closet door just as she saw a figure step in causing her to move back a bit more. Her body shook in fear as one arm was around her swollen stomach. The figure stopped in front of the door until the doors slowly opened revealing the person but to Evelyn's surprise. It was the butler of the house hold. \n\nA shaky sigh escapes her lips as she stood and embraced him. \n\n\"Why are you hiding lady Evelyn?\" He asked in confusion.\n\nElise still held onto him as she cried out \"T..there was a man. He killed Trevor\" she hiccup \"we have to leave\" she pleaded. \n\nBut the butler didn't move as he held a firm grip on Evelyn's wrist. This caused her eyebrows to furrowed as she looked at the butler until another set of footsteps appeared at the door.\n\n\"You've found her. Good\" the voice was husky with an ancient accent. \n\nShe looked to see that it was the same man that killed Trevor as she couldn't help but to notice his blood red eyes staring back at her. His red eyes looked at the butler \n\n\"Thank you. You may leave\" he ordered as the butler did what he was told as if he was being compelled.\n\nEvelyn took small steps back just as the man sped in front of her with inhuman speed. Her breath hitched in her throat as her green eyes stared into his. \n\n\"Such beauty\" the man spoke, lifting his hand up to her hair, gently stroking it \"to bad I have to kill you.\"\n\nA gasp of fright escapes Evelyn's lips as she couldn't help but to notice how long and sharp his nails were and as he spoke, his teeth weren't normal. His canines were much longer and sharper than any human. \n\n\"P..please don't hurt me\" she pleaded as a tear slip down her cheek, she held a hand to her stomach. \n\nThe man ignored her pleas as he leaned his head down to her neck, taking a satisfying sniff \"You smell delightful\" he smirked with a chuckle. \n\nBut Elise didn't know what was coming until she felt two sharp pinches on her neck as a painful gasp escapes her lips. Her hands immediately shot to the man's coat, gripping it tightly in her hands. She felt her blood being drained more and more and felt herself getting weak. Her grip slowly began to loosen and her eyes were struggling to stay awake. The man drained her of her blood , dropping her on the ground as a smirk appeared on his bloodied lips. \n\n\"This power. It's so strong\" he whispered feeling so much energy running through his dead veins. \n\nHe looked at the limp women one last time before leaving as his blood red eyes glowed in the darkness of the manor as rain poured down outside. \n\n\"Now I wait until the next doppelg\u00e4nger to be reborn.\" \n\n ~~\n\nThis is a start of a story I am writing and I find it interesting if I could try to make this into a roleplay with someone I can roleplay with long-term, someone that is detailed and doesn\u2019t write just a few sentences and someone who is serious about roleplaying. What I wrote is an idea of how I write. \n\nPlease do not steal. This is my story and for my use only.",

Sure, she had a nice life as a kid, after meeting her real friends, but as soon as she did, she moved, with her father. Her father didn\u2019t like how she was growing up so she had to go with him, and she hates him more than anything else in the world. So she grew more rebellious, going to parties and such. She met Guy B after a few months of living there. (His personality could be anything.) The two of them started to be friends, and started falling for each other quite fast. Soon, they are in a relationship and going strong. But will they be able to keep it going with the father she has? What kind of drama will they receive over time? What if someone tries to take one away? What is in store for them? \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nHello!

            "selftext": "Sailor Moon Roleplay?\n\nHello! As the request says, I am looking to perhaps do a 1x1 roleplay, from the Sailor Moon fandom.  Quite honestly, I believe that Sailor Moon can be one of the most fun things, to be able to roleplay, if both partners know it. I know the series decently well, but not the best, but I am willing to do whatever research, in order to satisfy my partner\n\n I am planning to use my original character, for which I have a Sailor Moon version of him, which I can link to you in PMs. But, I can also roleplay as a few of the Sailor Guardians as well (mostly Mercury, Jupiter and Venus). I would be looking for someone who can do canon characters, but I can roleplay as multiple characters, if needed.  \n\n I am also a semi-literate roleplayer, which means I mostly do 3-5 lines, but IS able to go past 5+, or even 10 + lines. I would be looking for someone who is around the same literacy as myself , and can do at least around 3-5 lines. If you choose to write more, that is perfectly fine by me. \n\nFinally, I LOVE creative stories and whatnot, at least when it comes to the Sailor Moon universe. I also have a basic plot in mind, which I can tell you in PMs, and which we can work on together.  I will also let you know of my rules and anything else you need to know\n\nSo, if you are interested, simply reply to this message or DM me. Thank you very much, and I look forward to roleplaying with you!\n\nAlso I am not abandoning you if you see this. I just love to do multiple roleplays \ud83d\ude01 ^^",

            "selftext": "So i have two plots i would like to try or if your not interested but have a fantasy themed plot in mind feel free to let me know, both are vastly different and ill explain the plots in brief.\n\nOh and i have discord and kik so just message me on whatever you prefer.\n\nPlot 1. The vampire empire has had historical growth and power but with other races uniting for their survival, an all out grueling hundred year war left all sides heavily in ruins. Treatys were signed and land allocated resolved some of the tensions, but vampires and their hunger for blood was always a rising problem and threat, a vampire had to be well trained to resist the urges of feeding, having to resort mostly on animal blood or those with the misfortune of committing a crime or stumbling into the vampire empire. \nIt has been 200 years after the war, a group of vampires had pillaged a human village and in retaliation a man was surprisingly capable of killing one of them, the vampire killed being a prince. \nThe man is taken to the vampire empire, treated as a prisoner, starved, beaten and was requested to receive his sentence from the queen herself only for a princess to walk in, asking to keep the human as, someone to drink from or for her amusement, or even for her alchemy research. only to realise and later admire the person that he really is. (The reason can vary) \n\nPlot 2. The land of Eskaya was a vibrant and lush land with its large expanses of nature that welcomed all walks of life with a refreshing embrace.\nWhere Forests ruled effortlessly and expanded the boarders. Forming an overgrowth over what was ancient ruins and decaying walls that used to be our towering defense almost a millennium ago.\n\nRecently tensions over royalty and politics were bound to happen, a man by the name of king Vulcan and his two daughters Hestia and Ember were notorious for their warpath and claiming land for their imperial empire. They occupied the west, the mountain ranges being a tactical decision. The land to the north stood Queen Khione, the true queen and blood of this land, not yet married and thrusted into her role after her fathers passing. She showed strength, courage and a strong sense of sovereignty that made the people of Eskaya admire her greatly. \n\nHer people however did not like this decision, wanting to fight, wanting to have their land free even with the certainty of death. But war loomed closer when a village was set on fire, fathers and sons of age slaughtered, the others kept as prisioners. It fueled the anger Vulcan wanted.\nQueen Khione had no choice but to arrange a meeting with Vulcan at the center of Eskaya, a holy land where many had fallen, their weapons, armor and remains littered the ground that grew into open fields.\n\nKnowing the risks, she was forced to play the hand she was given to her best ability. To help smooth the meeting and request for no war, the return of her people and compensation. She appointed a group of paladins to protect her at all costs knowing that war was coming, wishing for no more bloodshed.",

            "selftext": "Hi and Good Day to everyone!\n\nMy name is Kat, I'm 18 and I'm looking for Male Roleplayers to do a MxF roleplay with! I have some ideas but more or less they are interesting and I am someone who will keep a story going no matter what. Here are my rules however:\n\n* Please play only a Main Male character. You may play side female and male characters but the main MUST be male. \n* Please none of the following genres: NSFW, Slice of Life, Cyberpunk, War, Historically-Accurate or Fandom\n* I do third person and am Semi-Literate. I don't write a lot, maybe up to a paragraph at best.\n* Please be a male roleplayer!\n* Please also have Discord! I chat there!\n\nAs for Ideas, here's some basic ideas:\n\n1. Being Cursed (Fantasy, Slice of Life, Romance): Imagine your character lives a simple life. Attends college, loses their girlfriend, and struggles with family. That's when you meet my character. A strange character who seems kind but has a darker side. She is destined to be the next in throne to a evil court by her mother. Come to find out, you are also destined to be with her. So she curses you to be her bride.\n2. Destiny Being A Twist (Fantasy, Romance): Your character lives the same scheme over and over.. he saves a princess from a evil warlord and gets a medal and a good night sleep. But... what if that didn't happen? What if he doesn't save the princess and goes for the Daughter of the Evil Lord? \n3. Detectives in Fantasyland (Fantasy, Romance, Medieval, Fairytale): Characters from a Fairytale world live together in harmony with two sides. The Underworld and the Goodworld. Your character is an \"Out-Of-Character\" which means he doesn't have his own story or even exists in any stories. He's a detective that when Rapunzel doesn't have her prince come to save her or Cinderella doesn't fit the glass slipper, he comes in and fixes the story by reliving it. That's when he meets my character. A newbie who lost her previous partner by Monstro in Pinocchio. She seems kind... But has a dark side to her.. When Angry.\n4. Hunger Games + Future Diary (Fantasy, Romance, Violence): Your character wakes up one day in a different world.. What world? Well... a world like no other. He is with 200 other people who want to win the prize. To be immortal. Yet, he has to get past a crazed girl first.\n5. Assassin X Princess/Prince (Medieval, Fantasy, Romance): Living the high life seems so easy, well. Not for your character. You can be an assassin who's struggled with past decisions to come so far to run from home. Or you can be a Prince who struggles to makes mends with his parents after running away to be on his own. However what lies beyond the walls... lies a group who wants to take the Royalty down..\n6. Superheroes? (I have a hard time to get someone to make a great roleplay with this idea!) (Romance, Slice of Life, Fantasy): Two superheroes who go to the school and hang out all the time have no idea what their other life is. Come to find out, they are both superheroes! And they work together to take down criminals and punish those wrong doer's! But your character struggles with a major super villain... as a parent! (Also can do Supervillain X Superhero)\n7. Two People who hate each other having to raise a \"Special\" Child (Romance, Fantasy, Slice of Life): Two regular people living a regular life soon find out that their best friends died by the hands of a wicked mastermind. What reason? Because of the Chosen One! The Child itself is powerful and is the key to bringing humanity to it's greatest, to restore peace and love to the earth. But will you both put your hate aside to make amends? \n\n Please let me know! Ideas can be taken quickly so please DM me! Have a wonderful day!",

            "selftext": "Hello all! Good morning to everyone, my name is Rin and I've been looking forward to start my own group RP set within the world of BNHA ( My hero Academia.) This world is going to be strictly OCs and is a little different off of the main series. It does take place in Japan but the way I've written quirks are a little different. \n\nThe story of the world so far is that before UA, there was an altercation with the two One for All and All for one user's  which brought their unnatural quirks to life. In a battle that shook up most of the country, both users lost their life and had there bodies harvested by medical experts. In the studying in these quirks and the handlers , medical experts were able to give a person two Artificial quirks. From then on that person reproduced as any other person would have. Throughout generations and generations these genes were passed down, and now in the modern day there is many people capable of using two quirks.\n\nThe story is a very rough idea of where I want to go and this leads me to the entire Mod search. I'm looking for 1-3 people who are willing to help me create a story, help build the server and participate in being mods. \n\nI will say that I don't plan on this RP being all sunshine and rainbows most of the time. Bad stuff will happen and topics that aren't talked about will be talked about, so please be prepared.\n\nOther then that I would whoever messages me to present yourself almost in a Resume format. \n\n- What experience do you have being a mod.\n- Give me an example of an storytelling idea you've used.\nAnd so on, tell me why you'd be willing to help and possibly create the greatest server on this app. Thought I should mention that the server would take place on discord! Thanks all and I hope to see you soon!",

            "selftext": "Hello, I am KingOfCowards and I consider myself an experienced role-player. This by no means is me trying to discourage newer RP partners from joining me (I'm always willing to help you grow and learn). I welcome all levels of roleplay and have no hard restrictions of literacy level. We can do casual, advanced, or full blown novel level of writing per post. My personal preference is somewhere between casual and advanced.\n\nI am looking for some lucky partners to RP a variety of darker original magical girl settings. If you watch anime, you probably know what constitutes a magical girl, so I do not need to go over that.\n\nSome ideas I have are settings that have magical girls facing off against:\n\nLovecraftian horrors\n\nMagical girls (battle royale style)\n\nGovernment agencies\n\nGangs\n\nThemselves\n\n\\--\n\nI like to subvert the family friendly campy feel of many earlier magical girl shows with darker themes (like many recent shows). I am open to romance RP/smut of many varieties, but I would prefer to talk through those ideas in a private setting.\n\nWe can RP evil characters, good characters, or whatever you like as-well. Personally, a sort of anti-hero magical girl setting would neat to partake in. I like to tailor my experiences to my partners, so I have intentionally not gone too in-depth with the details. I use Discord for roleplay, so message me for those details.\n\nThank you.",

            "selftext": "Hi whoever you are reading my post here, I have gotten an itch to play out a roleplay that takes place in a urban fantasy setting and I thought why not turn to here and try and find someone that also have an itch to write a roleplay that takes place in a urban fantasy setting.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf you have a question what urban fantasy is think wizards, witches, necromancers, warlocks, elves, trolls, faeries and other magical beings but instead of being in some kind of medieval setting it taking place in present time. There is a good book series called Dresden Files that is Urban Fantasy book series which I can recommend.\n\nBut back to why I\u2019m writing here, I have no set idea for a roleplay to be honest and would rather discuss that with you. So it can be everything from just a slice of life roleplay to a mystery story to a battle between magical beings taking place in the streets of a big city.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo a little about me maybe, first of all I\u2019m in the CEST timezone (GMT +2) though for me timezones does not matter that much. I have been writing roleplays for 15+ years now, both in English and Swedish, though that being said I would not say I\u2019m a master at the craft of writing roleplays.\n\nAs for the writing I enjoy in roleplays, I\u2019 write mostly in first person and present tense, though I have written some stuff in third person. My writing length depends on what is going on in the story, though I enjoy writing longer pieces if I get the chance since I like diving into the details about the world and what goes on around the characters.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo if you are looking for a roleplay that takes place in a urban fantasy setting then please send me a message (and please to do not write to me on reddit chat since I don\u2019t see them plus I do not use reddit chat.) and we can see what kind of story we can craft together.",

            "selftext": " SPOILERS: The cheese is a lie. I'm lactose intolerant. Our entire relationship is built on *sand.*\n\nHi folks! I'm a 30+ hag looking for a literate to lit+ partner to do some world-building, plotting, scheming, and writing in original worlds (preferably), and some (very limited) fandoms. I RP on Discord pretty much exclusively at the moment, but Google Docs is also a possibility.\n\nI'm in college full time, so my availability is somewhat limited, but I'm upfront about when I'm drowning in homework and can't dedicate time to a post. That said, I am also *super* chill. Roleplay is fun, I don't stress about it when someone needs time to sort out RL stuff before they can make a post themselves.\n\nMy likes: Fantasy be it high or low, modern-day, slightly-in-the-future, cyberpunk, werewolves, vampires, comedy, lightheartedness, grimdark, romance, androids, Vikings, solid communication, people who do or don't want to be friends and are upfront about it either way \\\\o/, arranged marriage scenarios, enemies or friends-to-lovers, bodyguard-and-maiden, awkward smart girl meets driven smart guy and they somehow hit it off\n\nMy dislikes: Boundary pushers, white supremacists, fidelity-challenged IRL, and people who don't have ideas. Bruh, if I wanted to be the other woman and/or carry a relationship, I'd just go on Tinder.\n\nFandoms: Dragon Age (Inquisition), ATLA/LoK, Monster Hunter, Elder Scrolls (Skyrim), Vermintide (I WILL HAPPILY PLAY KERILLIAN IN A NO-ROMANCE SCENARIO), Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, probably stuff I'm missing.\n\nSound appealing? Send me a chat or a DM if interested and I'll fire off an invite on Discord!",

            "selftext": "\nHiya! The name's Jonathan/Jon. As the title says, I'm looking for some Discord roleplaying pals!\n\nSo, a bit about me!\n\n-I'm a male. I prefer to play as a male, I don\u2019t mind who I play opposite! I can no coaxed into playing a female however. I do play female side characters, I don't fine them hard to play, I'm just more comfortable with playing male. I\u2019m also open to playing as GM/DM for the roleplay.\n\n-I have been roleplaying for a number of years now, I think it\u2019s 3ish. I tend to reply with 1-4 paragraphs, always enough to work off and that\u2019s all I ask from you, as well as no text speak, I can\u2019t express my hate towards people that use \u2018u\u2019 over \u2018you\u2019 and also being semi-literate. \n\n-I'm also really friendly OOC and would love to make some friends through this, so if at all possible would love to talk outside of the roleplay, as well as roleplaying.\n\n-I can reply multiple times a day - I'm a fast writer. \n\n\nSo, here are some requirements. \n\n-Please tell me if you're gonna be gone for a while - I don't wanna think you're dead or something.\n\n-Please be at least a tad active. I only require a minimum of one post a day unless you're busy.\n\n-Please use somewhat correct grammar, punctuation and spelling! \n\nNow, onto some genres I'm into.\n\nYou are welcome to play as canon or OC characters. \n\n-Superheroes! I mean who doesn\u2019t love superheroes nowadays? They make up most of popular fiction. I\u2019d be willing to roleplay in the DC or Marvel universes, we could also make our superhero world (I have one if you\u2019d like to use to it!)\n\n-Fantasy! The classic roleplay setting of dungeons and dragons, knights and princesses. I think this could be a fun to roleplay in, full of magic and what not.\n\n-Sci-Fi! Another stereotypical genre starships and laser guns. A whole universe just waiting to be explored.\n\nI'm open to anything, though!\n\nIf you have any fandoms you\u2019d be interested in mention them in your message and I\u2019ll let you know if I know of them.\n\nSince I have to give a plot to get past the rules, I\u2019ll guess I\u2019ll go for what I\u2019m craving the most, a space opera.\n\nNow this idea is very basic and par for the course of most space operas, but I can imagine our characters as bounty hunters of some kind, maybe we both work for the same crime boss and get put together on our first mission together.\n\nIf interested, send me a PM with some info about you, what plot you're looking for I'll send my Discord info if I'm interested!",

            "selftext": "Hello. \n\nLike the title already told you, I'm looking for a long term fantasy roleplay. \n\nI'm a 25 year old female from Switzerland and write roleplay since three years. I'm literate and detailed. I want to play as and with realistic characters. However, and I can\u2019t stress this enough, immature, all cute and innocent characters are for me a no-no. I really don\u2019t enjoy it and feel it as rather annoying (maturity is the key, even for non romantic role plays). I'm okay with NSFW, but has to be well written and not taking over the whole roleplay. I write in past tense and in third person. I can write multiple characters at once. \n\nI\u2019m open minded and love to have an OC chat for brainstorming and plotting. I usually create a server on discord for the rp, which keep things neat, so we really can go big. I\u2019d love to build a whole world with cities, races, magic, conflicts and more. I\u2019ve already some kind of ideas for plots, but they need to be fleshed out, maybe with your input? \n\nGrammar errors don\u2019t bother me, however I\u2019d prefer someone who know the difference between your and you're. I also only accept writers who are at least 18+. \n\nI'm also up from some fandom ideas, Blizzard games (World of Warcraft, Overwatch), some Animes (very Limited, for example Noragami), Books: His dark materials, Eragon. Just ask, I'm very open for anything. \n\nFeel free to send me a message if you\u2019re interested. :D\n\nRespectfully, Nightborn_Priestess",

            "selftext": "Hello, to anyone who might be reading this, I'm a 25 year old male seeking a female roleplay partner to fill my time. I'm currently still recovering from quarantine {I'm still not even fully out of it yet} so I'm currently just trying to help distract myself from the stress of being unemployed and boredom. As well as to practice my character and world building skills. I am atleast a semi-lit Roleplayer, most of the time I mirror my partners in length, or try my best too, and I'm looking for something with adventure, action, romance, and well, possibly some nsfw stuff {though I don't focus on it, and if it's not wanted it can be skipped, but I personally find it nice to fill the time when we are either out of ideas or simply bored}\n\nI'm mainly looking something set more in medieval times, with any/all fantasy aspects you can imagine, magic, other races, kingdoms, etc...but I'm also open to doing anime fandom roleplays, for that, you'll have to specify what fandom if that's something that interests you, and as a disclaimer for that, I do not do canon pairings, only ocs.\n\nI know this probably isn't the most entertainment of ads to read, but for those of you that do and reach out to me, I want to thank you in advance! And for those of you that don't, hopefully we can all find what we are looking for, enjoy your day!",

            "selftext": " \n\nHey everyone ! I\u2019m looking for a roleplay partner with whom I could create a story revolving around a group of people who found themselves stranded in the wilderness, far from any civilization. They\u2019ll have no other choice than to overcome the circumstances they found themselves in, and survive in a place where most wouldn\u2019t be able to.\n\nAs to who those people are, how, when and where did they end up - those are the plot questions I\u2019d like to discuss with whoever would like to write this story with me, since there are many possibilities for a story with that premise. From a damaged ship crashing into an island in the Pacific, to an airplance crashing somewhere in the Arctic, and plenty of other ideas we could use.\n\nHere\u2019s some important info:  \n\n\n* I want to write a story about a ***group*** of survivors, so I\u2019m looking for a roleplay partner who doesn\u2019t shy away from writing multiple characters.\n* It will be a realistic story set during the modern times, so there won't be any supernatural occurances or similar things.\n* I write in 3rd person past tense.\n* I usually write from 2 to 4 paragraphs, but I don't have any length expectations for people I write with, since for me the general rule is that any reply is good as long as it gives us something to reply to and drives the story forward.\n* I can use either discord or google docs for roleplaying.\n* I will be active only on weekends, so I won't be able to partake in the roleplay on a daily basis.\n* No sexual scenes or descriptions.  \n\n\nAnd that's it. If you like this idea for a story, you are more than welcome to send me a message. My time zone is GMT +1, so you can check with that whether it's the middle of the night for me or not, that might give you a clue as to when I might be able to respond to you.  \n   \nThank you for reading this, and have a nice day !",

But instead of becoming your mediocre superheroes both of these guys transform into female werewolves!\n\nThis roleplay would be an exploration of one's identity and maybe even coming of age as two young dudes transform and shift their gender and species while they fight crime and demons!\n\nThis roleplay would be long-term and I hope you are interested in long descriptive roleplay as well as heavy worldbuilding as it is my favorite past time besides this.\n\nI want our characters to have drama and even moments of romance if you're interested!\n\nI roleplay in 1st person although I can possibly roleplay in 3rd person as well, I do multi-para roleplays with long responses as well and I hope someone is interested in that as well.\n\nI hope I can meet someone who is interested in this as I really want to do this, this mix exploration and crimefighting with some romance would be really cool to do!\n\nPm me if you are interested!\n\n(Place the word \"Shewolf\" somewhere in your message)",

            "selftext": " Hi  there, I haven't done a fandom rp  in a VERY long time and I'm in love  with this series. I wanted to do a  Ninny x Snufkin ship and I was  looking for someone to play Snufkin. I  don't know, I just feel wrong  pairing a self insert OC with him and I  always thought if they met,  they make a cute couple(I do be shipping  moomin and snufkin though,  haha). I am also happy with playing side  characters to help move the  plot if you are as well!\n\nWriting:   Third persona and lit (I can do semi-lit in areas). I just really like   writing and I hope to find someone with just as much passionate\n\nPlot:   I wanted to do a slow burn romance, it aking time to build up and   friendship developing first. In this plot, I wanted to place it 5 years   into the future. For this idea I had, Ninny got lost at sea and has   found her way back to Moomin Valley but she is all alone. She lost her   faithful companion and had to learn how to live a nomadic lifestyle.  I   was thinking she could either run into Snukfkin, as she has to learn  how  to survive in the forest or she runs into the moomins and she tells   them about what happened and they shelter her. Ninny then expresses  wanting to learn how to live on her own and she eventually meets   Snufkin. I'm fine with it happening either way!\n\nNSFW?  This series is just so freaking cute, IF you do want to go down this   road the most I would be able to handle is vanilla for this (despite   going hard in OC rp's, this world and these characters are just so   precious)\n\nIf you are interested,   please just send me a DM here! I'm either happy with rping on discord or kik! Thank you &lt;3",

Depending on the plot this can range from not a very nice, more lighthearted character to a supervillain to an evil genius. I\u2019m just really craving that villain character, you know?\n\nNow of course, my characters wouldn\u2019t all just be extremely serious, no-emotion characters. They would have human sides to all of them, as every good character should. \n\nI do have a few plots ready, but feel free to message me some of yours if you\u2019d like. All I ask is that you\u2019re fairly literate and give me something to work with in my response. \n\nI hope to hear from you -R.",

            "selftext": "Hello, all! \n\nWith quarantine taking a toll on the amount of activities one can do to kill time, I have taken up the art of roleplaying once again. I would consider myself a literate writer as I have many years of experience, and am seeking partners who fall into the same category. I typically use discord as a medium, and my responses fall anywhere between 3-8 paragraphs depending on the situation. Chat scenes are always shorter, while details plot progression posts can be much longer. I play characters of all genders and I\u2019m very descriptive when the mood for writing strikes me ~\n\n____________________________________________\n*Now, onto the loose ideas I have for the story itself!*\n\n  - Think supernatural happenings of every variety. Closely related to the Southern Gothic genre, aside from the fact that it would take place in the North and involve a lot more surrealism. \n\n  - I have always been such a fan of horror, especially when it comes to horror of the psychological variety. I envision this story being the kind where we craft a variety of interesting characters. I like the idea of monsters, Eldritch creatures, cosmic demons, seraphim angels, aliens, gods, and everything in between. \n\n  - Fandom Inspirations: While I am not particularly looking for any sort of canon storylines, my ideas were mildly inspired by several outside sources. These include WTNV, Archive 81, The Magnus Archives, Annihilation, Lovecraft, Twin Peaks, Wayward Pines, etc. \n\n**Have you ever dreamed of a small, rainy, beautiful forest town where all conspiracy theories were real? Send me a message and let\u2019s create something truly wondrous together!**",

            "selftext": "Heyo, it has been a minute since I've posted on here and I am going to be the least helpful person on this subreddit at the moment as I have two ideas about what I want to do and not much else. I'm kind of in a lull with my writing and hoping to find someone to really get chatty with who understands my work schedule flip from first to thirds often so while I usually reply multiple times a day there may be days where I disappear as I flip different sleep schedules. \n\nPlease pm me as I do not respond to comments on my post. I will ask for a writing sample and I'm looking for a literate partner and like to know that our writing matches before agreeing to a game.\n\nabout me\n\n* I'm a semi-lit roleplayer, often posting 3-8 paragraphs a post for each character, though this definitely varies depending on what is currently happening in game.\n* I have been roleplaying for well over a decade.\n* I have very few limits, comfortable with most things. I don't want an ERP, it won't be tolerated. I don't mind it in the game, but the game has to be about plot.\n*  All characters will be 18+ (usually mid to late twenties) as I do enjoy adult content in my games, just not as the central focus. \n* I love ooc and am very friendly, world-building beforehand is huge.\n* Romance is a must.\n* I prefer playing mxf couples. I love doubling up or playing the female, though I usually want to double up anyway. I will also play multiple plots so if you will play the male to my plot I will do the same for you! I can do separate games for double up purposes, I'm super flexible.\n* Just because a topic isn't listed here doesn't mean I'm closed to other ideas. I **love** tropes and cliches. I love original plots.\n* I am in my 20's.\n* I will probably make a Pinterest board for our game and quite likely a playlist.\n* I am flexible about where we post, though I prefer Discord or google docs.\n\nwhat I'm looking for\n\n* Please be semi-lit to lit, at minimum two-three decent paragraphs. I can't respond to three sentences.\n* I want someone who can match the content of my post and can post on a semi-regular basis. I'm one of those annoying people who needs a response at least two or three times a week minimum to keep my muse on a game unless something comes up.\n* Someone who is female or in the LGBTQ+ community. Trans men and women are welcome!\n* Someone comfortable with playing multiple characters if needed and help with NPCs.\n* Someone willing to work with world-building and plot.\n* Someone comfortable with adult content and open with what they are and aren't comfortable with.\n* Someone over the age of 18,  I'm sorry but I don't write with minors and there is no exception to that rule.\n* I'm looking for someone I can chat with outside of the game and just generally make a new friend with!\n\nPLOT IDEAS! (look at mem coming up with ideas!)\n\n* Angels and Demons... but aliens. This is based on an OLD game I had back in 2013 when I was a wee baby gamer that I'm hoping to revamp. Obviously the goal is to make it more mature and advanced and I have some general feelings and ideas. I don't have a ton of world-building done so I can take on multiple partners for this idea and I would love to find someone to put their own spin on it as nothing is set in stone, please don't feel scared that I have all this lore you'll have to read through, I promise I don't. The main goal is to start on earth and eventually move into space where it opens worlds (literally) of possibilities. \n* Werewolves. Campy, tropy, giant wolves. I'm looking for something a bit easier, probably a smaller post, game where I can really indulge in stereotypes and cliches. I'm talking outdated wolf hierarchy models, good old fashioned fun where it's not taken to seriously. I got one idea about four of the largest packs all being attacked at once causing mass devastation to the werewolf population and now they all have to join together and fight an impending war against 'insert bad guy here'.\n\nHope you message me! Would love to do some world-building.",

I\u2019m just about to finish my marathon of the Halo games, and I\u2019m reading some of the expanded media in between... and let\u2019s just say I REALLY want a Halo Roleplay right about now. I\u2019d consider myself quite advanced with Halo\u2019s story/lore, but this advertisement is still definitely open to the more casual fans; in fact, it\u2019ll probably give you the opportunity to learn even more! \nSo, I\u2019m looking for you to play a female Spartan III against my experienced Spartan II. I\u2019m definitely planning on us slowly building a squad, giving us the chance to Mix up our team\u2019s tactics, weapons, armors- and of course backstories, dynamics, etc. \n(We\u2019ll of course discuss characters in PM\u2019s, and I\u2019m more than willing to help you make your Spartan III OC if you don\u2019t have one.) \n\nNow, onto the prompt- this is more or less a setup for the background, because I\u2019d like to discuss more intricate things In PM\u2019s.\n\nPrompt: The Spartan Program... the UNSC\u2019s symbol of resistance against the Covenant\u2014 the elite, the frontline. And above all else, you count yourself among this number, a newly trained Spartan 3. Seemingly by mistake, The Prophet of Truth discovered Earth, not immediately recognising it as the home-world Of their mortal enemy. But one thing was clear: the very heart of humanity was at extreme risk, and without the elite Spartans... Earth was looking like it would end up like Reach. \nSo, you\u2019re scrambled into action- being assigned into a unit that... only had one other member. While the infamous Master Chief is a public symbol by now, the UNSC likes to keep some of their Spartan 2\u2019s... secretive. \nYou\u2019ve heard whispers of the man- someone they\u2019d send in somewhere on his own, to get something \u201cdone\u201d. Covenant ships mysteriously crashing, trails of dead Covenant... when given his file to better know your new commander, nearly everything was blacked out except for his name: \u201cWyvern.\u201d \nToday\u2019s the event for your very first introduction to one of the UNSC\u2019s closely kept secrets... who has apparently chosen you above everyone else. \n\n\nWell, that about concludes the prompt! If this interests you, please send me a message; I\u2019ll only be replying to private messages, NOT chats. Tell me a little about yourself- such as how you write, your knowledge of Halo, and your time zone. After that, I\u2019m more than willing to give you my Discord so we can get the discussion going.",

I have a few plot ideas such as a resort trip but I would love to hear some of your ideas too! We can go into it a little more on Discord. However the four girls I would be interested to be in the roleplay would be Beli, Audrey, Tiffany or Kyu. Any questions or if you're interested shoot me a DM! That's all for now!

            "selftext": " Sailor Moon Roleplay?\n\nHello! As the request says, I am looking to perhaps do a 1x1 roleplay, from the Sailor Moon fandom.  Quite honestly, I believe that Sailor Moon can be one of the most fun things, to be able to roleplay, if both partners know it. I know the series decently well, but not the best, but I am willing to do whatever research, in order to satisfy my partner\n\n I am planning to use my original character, for which I have a Sailor Moon version of him, which I can link to you in PMs. But, I can also roleplay as a few of the Sailor Guardians as well (mostly Mercury, Jupiter and Venus). I would be looking for someone who can do canon characters, but I can roleplay as multiple characters, if needed.  \n\n I am also a semi-literate roleplayer, which means I mostly do 3-5 lines, but IS able to go past 5+, or even 10 + lines. I would be looking for someone who is around the same literacy as myself , and can do at least around 3-5 lines. If you choose to write more, that is perfectly fine by me. \n\nFinally, I LOVE creative stories and whatnot, at least when it comes to the Sailor Moon universe. I also have a basic plot in mind, which I can tell you in PMs, and which we can work on together.  I will also let you know of my rules and anything else you need to know\n\nSo, if you are interested, simply reply to this message or DM me. Thank you very much, and I look forward to roleplaying with you!\n\n Also I am not abandoning you if you see this. I just love to do multiple roleplays \ud83d\ude01 ^^",

Currently looking for someone who is open to doing a long term romance rp with NSFW elements. I also like doing shorter 'One Shot' type rps on the side to.. Explore? our characters' dynamic! (But we don't have to do that if you don't want to!) I also want us to have an OOC friendship! I like to send people memes and generally be a nuisance.\n\nI've got a lot of basic plot ideas so let me tell you about my character instead! His name is Locke and he's either an ex-criminal or still currently a criminal depending on how you wanna play it. He loves cooking, cars, and a butthead lol. He's not quick to get into a relationship but once he does, he's a pretty loyal lover. The rest you can find out yourself! He's bisexual with a preference for men but is open to women too!\n\nSo yeah I guess if this is interesting to you, hit me up! I am ONLY looking for people over the age of 18!

            "selftext": "\nHiya! The name's Jonathan and Jon. As the title says, I'm looking for some Discord roleplaying pals!\n\nSo, a bit about me!\n\n-I'm a male. I prefer to play as a male, I don\u2019t mind who I play opposite! I can no coaxed into playing a female however. I do play female side characters, I don't fine them hard to play, I'm just more comfortable with playing male. I\u2019m also open to playing as GM/DM for the roleplay.\n\n-I have been roleplaying for a number of years now, I think it\u2019s 3ish. I tend to reply with 1-4 paragraphs, always enough to work off and that\u2019s all I ask from you, as well as no text speak, I can\u2019t express my hate towards people that use \u2018u\u2019 over \u2018you\u2019 and also being semi-literate. \n\n-I'm also really friendly OOC and would love to make some friends through this, so if at all possible would love to talk outside of the roleplay, as well as roleplaying.\n\n-I can reply multiple times a day - I'm a fast writer. \n\n\nSo, here are some requirements. \n\n-Please tell me if you're gonna be gone for a while - I don't wanna think you're dead or something.\n\n-Please be at least a tad active. I only require a minimum of one post a day unless you're busy.\n\n-Please use somewhat correct grammar, punctuation and spelling! \n\nNow, onto some genres I'm into.\n\nYou are welcome to play as canon or OC characters. \n\n-Superheroes! I mean who doesn\u2019t love superheroes nowadays? They make up most of popular fiction. I\u2019d be willing to roleplay in the DC or Marvel universes, we could also make our superhero world (I have one if you\u2019d like to use to it!)\n\n-Fantasy! The classic roleplay setting of dungeons and dragons, knights and princesses. I think this could be a fun to roleplay in, full of magic and what not.\n\n-Sci-Fi! Another stereotypical genre starships and laser guns. A whole universe just waiting to be explored.\n\nI'm open to anything, though!\n\nIf you have any fandoms you\u2019d be interested in mention them in your message and I\u2019ll let you know if I know of them.\n\nSince I have to give a plot to get past the rules, I\u2019ll guess I\u2019ll go for what I\u2019m craving the most, a space opera.\n\nNow this idea is very basic and par for the course of most space operas, but I can imagine our characters as bounty hunters of some kind, maybe we both work for the same crime boss and get put together on our first mission together.\n\nIf interested, send me a PM with some info about you, what plot you're looking for I'll send my Discord info if I'm interested!",

            "selftext": "Another cold and damp night in London. The kind that sinks straight to your bones, sends a shiver down your spine, and bites through any coat or layer that tries to stand in its way. Such was expected, though, for a February evening. \n\nA woman entered the small pub just off the first road over the Tower Bridge. Busy area, yes, but still maintained itself as a hole in the wall type of establishment. She sat down, leaving a seat as a buffer between the stranger already there and her. \n\nIf the stranger were to look over at the pub\u2019s new patron, they\u2019d see a woman in her mid twenties. Butterscotch locks fell in waves to the midpoint of her back. Blue eyes held specks of green that were dashed and divided like stars in the night sky. They were sharp and unforgiving, even when her face said otherwise. Her cheek bones were high, her jaw bones defined and shaping the area just below full, rose colored lips. The rest of her features were small, afterthoughts to place on a face exquisitely framed. Her nose was small, the tip slightly pointed optimistically upward.\n\n\u201cA gin and tonic, please?\u201d The woman ran her hand through her hair as the bartender began working on the drink in front of her. Her voice was soft, a posh British accent shining through. \n\nAnd yet, it would be her secret to keep that she *wasn\u2019t* at all British. Her secret that she\u2019d been \u201creleased\u201d from a Russian prison two years prior, and her secret that she was a very, very dangerous assassin. \n\n\nHi, I\u2019m hoping to find someone descriptive and literate to write this RP with me. I usually do a few paragraphs to novella length responses and I\u2019m looking for a similar response length from my partner. I leave who your character is to your discretion\u2014 I enjoy writing much better when I don\u2019t know what twists or turns my partner may have.  Some obvious suggestions include: a typical cat-and-mouse game between an investigator looking for the killer (her) involved in a line of different hits who is seemingly a ghost, a cat-and-cat game between rival assassin for a different org/country, and so on. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested and have a character idea in mind, please message me with a continuation of the above story. If you have any questions or comments, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out.",

I lost interest in my previous story idea, so have a couple others to offer out for some fun. \n\n*Idea 1* A vampire and a human story. I don\u2019t have one fully fleshed out, but the guy will be the vamp. He can either be someone that she has always known is a vamp, a new friend/love interest whom she later finds out is a vamp, or we can discuss another direction.\n\n*Idea 2* A witch summons an arch angel down for help. My character would be the witch, the male character would be the arch angel. Reason for summoning can be discussed.\n\n*Idea 3* A witch and a vampire. This idea could be merged with idea 1. No real direction set for this one, could be discussed. \n\n*Idea 4* Something apocalyptic. I am not going to flesh it out, will leave it open ended for my partner and I to discuss. \n\n*Idea 5* Is there something you have to suggest?\n\nI role play on Discord only. Third person past tense only. Does not have to be long term. Can just be short term unless we mesh good and choose to make it long term. Would like romance in all of these ideas. Does not have to be immediate romance, can be slow burn. I am going through some things in real life, so at times I will not be able to respond right away, or for a little bit. And sometimes I may \u201cvanish\u201d without notice. But I will always come back and give explanation for disappearing. I plan to offer the same courtesy to my partner.\n\nIf we mesh good, maybe we can plan something more long term. I am able to write anywhere between 1 and 5 paragraphs, depending on what I have to work with. I do not expect my partner to do as much as I do, but at least give me something to work with. If you become bored with the idea, let me know. Maybe we can spice it up. If something about how my character acts bothers you, let me know. I can try to fix it. Don\u2019t just give me a vague message of it\u2019s not working and block me. That\u2019s just rude. Give me a chance to try to fix things to save the story before you bail on me. Thanks. If I don\u2019t get any takers on any of these ideas by Monday, I am done with role playing entirely.",

It's too much for one person to handle, and I'm not going to put hours into it each day for the drama that is entailing, the brigading going on, and quite honestly, I'm tired and I have a lot of stuff IRL that is more important than this subreddit. Take that for what you will, but my family comes first (and so should yours).\n\nSo while you can't post, you can still search past posts and link up with people if you've posted here before. You just can't make a new post.\n\nThe needamod post is the other sticky here, and if you qualify, you can apply via modmail.\n\nUntil I get more qualified applicants, we work on training up and revamping the rules, /r/roleplay will not be available for posting new posts at this time! but you can check past posts and see if people there can suit your fancy.\n\nCheers!",

            "selftext": "You were just a child when you received your first dragon...a small scaly beast that quickly proved to be a worthy companion and close friend. Here, in the magical elven kingdom of Avalon, it was common for young elves of prominent status to be gifted a dragon to bond with. You, however, are no elf. You are a human who was found all alone and without a family. Although the elves are generally mistrusting of humans, The elven queen took pity on you, choosing to raise you as one of her own. Being a human in an elven kingdom isn't easy...but luckily you aren't alone.   \n\n\nHi! Literate and experienced roleplayer here looking for a long-term rp partner able to contribute to an emotional adventure unlike any other! I have a general plot/setting as explained above but am hoping to find someone that is open to world-building. The general plot revolves around you, a human, becoming a dragon-rider and forming a close bond with said dragon.   \n\n\nThis rp will have TWO main phases. The first being your character as a child rescued by elves and participating in their tradition of riding/training dragons. Together you and your dragon will defy all odds, becoming close friends, and go on many adventures/tests! The second phase will be you and your dragon as adults or teens. They will likely be forced to leave home and undergo a very long journey.  \n\n\nYour choices matter in the RP!! How you treat your dragon and the others around you will impact the story and character development. If you've always wanted to have your very own dragon companion, this is the RP for you!  \n\n\nI am a very literate writer. I tend to be descriptive but quick with my responses to keep the plot moving. Please send me a message if you are interested or have questions. I typically roleplay on Discord and enjoy roleplaying for great lengths of time.  \n\n\nLet's be friends! I love chatting with my rp partners, sharing artwork, etc.",

            "selftext": "\nHi! i\u2019m looking for an long term rp partner! Just to get some things out of the way:\n\n- I\u2019m Jenny, i\u2019m a twenty-two year old female in the US.\n- This is a one-on-one RP.\n- I rp in a third-person, literate, multi-paragraph (2-4) style and I prefer you would do the same.\n- I would ask that my partner has some input into the RP, no matter how small. Don\u2019t be afraid to suggest things!\n- Romance is good in my book.\n- Again, PLEASE feel free to have input.  I love crafting stories but all ideas are good ones! I want to make this an enjoyable experience for the both of us, with neither carrying the weight of the plot/characters. It\u2019s just a hassle attempting to create a world without the others input/help in making it, yknow?\n- I\u2019d also ask that my partner would take some control over NPC\u2019s/other characters.  We don\u2019t need to make them a major part of the story, and i\u2019m not asking that you take a whole character under your wing, but some help fleshing out the world would be greatly appreciated!\n\nAlright, with that out of the way, i\u2019ll get to brass tacks.\n\nThis would be following the Metal Gear Solid generally aesthetic/vibe, although without taking direct things from the game series itself.  The plot would most likely involve our characters in a futuristic setting, most likely in the near future (2030\u2019s-ish).  Things like laser-weapons would not be common, but there would be fantastical elements to this.\n\nThe year is (whenever in that timeframe), with political tensions at an all time high. Deep within Canada, there is a large oil processing facility that was recently uncovered.  Usually, discoveries like this would be brushed off, however many global powers had taken notice of its resemblance to a building that was created after WW2.  The building is called \u2018The Pit\u2019 , according to myth, contained \u2018the seed for the next stage of human evolution\u2019.  Countries like the United States, Russia, China, and even the EU have sent in their best forces, to including British SAS, the Marine Corp, and many more.  Along with this, private military groups have also joined the frey, although their motives are mostly unknown.  Among the pantheon of war hero\u2019s that have been sent to The Pit, multiple nationally-proclaimed \u2018super soldiers\u2019 have been sent in by all nations, along with some private military organizations, and a fair share of underground national organizations.  Most groups and individuals are misinformed, each group having different beliefs on what the \u2018goal\u2019 of the mission is.  Some countries, like the United States, sent in troops under the guise of \u2018claiming\u2019 the area, their main goal to capture and control the area.  Other countries are truthful about what they\u2019re after, but most are hiding this whole occurrence under a blanket of fibs.\n\nSo, that\u2019s it.  I\u2019m open to ideas, so feel free to suggest something! If you\u2019re interested, please contact me!!Thank you!",

What I\u2019m looking for are people who are interested in taking part of a Star Wars RP with completely original characters and a story. This could include worldbuilding and in depth character stories, but I am also definitely interested in pursuing romance. If this sounds like something you might be interested in, pm me. Hope to see you soon~",

            "selftext": "Hey there,\nThanks for taking a look at this post. First off, introduction of myself: I\u2019m 20, male, have been role playing for about a year or so. I write third person, I only use discord, and I like a minimum of one or two descriptive paragraphs with good grammar and spelling.\n\nNow intro of the idea: I\u2019m looking for a role play in a modern setting with dramatic elements and some interesting character dynamics. I\u2019d like to find someone who can play a more good looking, confident, fun loving character (for reference, think of Connor Walsh from \u201cHow to get away with Murder\u201d on Netflix). Someone like that who would play opposite my more mild, work loving, stickler for the rules type who is sometimes unsure of himself, but generally has an average level of confidence. It\u2019d be neat if one dramatic element was a prior attempt at a relationship or something that didn\u2019t pan out.\n\nLastly, some basic things to note: The idea is flexible and I like there to be an open conversation about what we wanna do and where to push the story. I also don\u2019t ghost, as I find it kinda lame. I\u2019ll always be frank and tell you if I feel something is off or if I grow bored of the story, and I\u2019ll always leave the door open to talk things out before discontinuing (if that happens). Please extend the same curtesy (even if it\u2019s just a \u201cYo I\u2019m leaving now\u201d before ghosting).\n\nThat\u2019s all folks. Let me know if the general idea interests you and if you\u2019d like to play a Connor Walsh type character.",

Anyways I\u2019m back and looking for a new partner. Now while I mostly enjoy FxF pairings; I\u2019m open to FxM. Slice of Life is my main squeeze, and romance too! I\u2019m always open to something dystopian or even supernatural. Finding any partner willing to do something zombie-ish is hard these days but I\u2019m also not opposed to that either. \n\nI would prefer someone close to my age range or near there. A paragraph at least, one liners aren\u2019t that thrilling, sorry. I\u2019m not into fandom writings (nothing against just haven\u2019t done any since high school). \n\nIf you\u2019d like to see if we can come up with something, feel free to message me privately.",

I'm Dana and I am currently seeking individuals ages 18+ (bonus points if you're 21+ tbh but you **must** be at least 18, I will under no circumstance roleplay with minors) for some indie, real world-based, plot-driven, OC character roleplays. Fandoms are cool and everything but I honestly cannot roleplay characters that I myself did not create. A little bit about me as a writer: \n\n\\- I write exclusively on Discord just for the sake of having all my writing in one concise place. \n\n\\- I do lit or semi-lit, I strive to provide at least 3 paragraphs if not more, depending on what's going on and the effort the other party is giving me. \n\n\\- I play both m and f and ask that if you reach out, you do as well. I no longer roleplay with people who only play f; I find that this results in me getting the short end of the stick time and time again and wasting my effort on people that do not meet me halfway or even a quarter of the way. \n\n\\- I am highly communicative and ask that you be as well; if I won't be able to reply for a couple of days or more, I will let you know. \n\n\\- Time-wise, I am in the EST. \n\nI am open to smut/spicy content and I ask that you be as well, however, I am primarily looking for **plot-driven content** and do not want the entire roleplay to circle around smut. Also, since I know this is a bit of a debate in the rpc, I do use face claims and ask that you be open to them. I by no means require them from my partner(s), but I do require partner(s) to respect my choice to use them. \n\nPlease, if you're into any of the following content: college/international college plots, small-town plots, apartment/big city plots, celebrity (musicians, actors, dancers, athletes) plots, crime/mafia plots, anything angsty/mature, socialites/trust fund babies; PLEASE reach out via the DMs so we can get something going!

I have a few plot ideas such as a resort trip but I would love to hear some of your ideas too! We can go into it a little more on Discord. However the four girls I would be interested to be in the roleplay would be Beli, Audrey, Tiffany or Kyu. Any questions or if you're interested shoot me a DM! That's all for now!

            "selftext": "The quality of mercy was not one that Imperator Caesar Lucius Domitius Aurelianus Augustus would've hastened to associate with himself. He'd certainly made use of it in his eastern campaigns with a fairly liberal hand, but despite his rumoured generosity and willingness to compromise he'd always considered himself iron-willed and even harsh. It had been that iron will of his that had allowed him to restore the Roman Empire from the tumult of decades upon decades of continued civil war - and it had been that harshness which had driven the inexorable advance of his legions from the dark forests of the Danube to the lush fields of Palmyra.\n\nNever in all his years would he have expected that his last moments would've been spent in Thrace however - especially not with that end coming at the end of swords wielded by his own men.\n\nThe question of *why* looked to be spilling from his lips, but no matter how he might've tried the words would not come. His Praetorian Guard looked almost as aghast at the turn of events as he, but as they turned and left him bleeding on the cool stone floor of his temporary residence in Caenophrurium he found his gaze settling on the cruel smirk brought onto the lips of his secretary Eros.\n\n*Of course.* He thought, already feeling the cool slip of unconsciousness that matched the feel of the smooth stone on his cheek, *A man with everything to lose because of his own actions.*\n\nNow alone in the abandoned manor house Aurelian looked up into the heavens. He could feel his consciousness slipping in tandem with the black seeping of his own blood. The physical pain was a distant echo now however when compared to the cruel sting of betrayal. He'd given all he had for Rome only to be betrayed by those he counted dearest - his own men. Had he not already felt the embrace of Pluto waiting he might've felt the rise of his wroth, but in truth his last thought before falling to unconsciousness was one of disappointment.\n\nPerhaps t'was his faith in the Cult of Sol Invictus, or perhaps the memory of his grandeur or perhaps even simple luck, but Aurelian did not perish that day. His bleeding and broken body was found by men yet loyal to him and after many days and nights of painful recovery he reassembled several loyal cohors worth of men and struck his own camp in the wee hours of the night. Vengeance eluded him however for rather than finding men drunk on power and victory he found his treacherous secretary Eros already dead by the hands of the men who'd killed him, and those very men falling to their knees to beg his mercy and forgiveness.\n\nDespite his earlier musings on the quality of mercy, he had none to offer. The Aurelian that emerged from the shadow realm was far colder and harsher than the man that had perished. Not only were the men responsible for the assassination attempt summarily executed, but in the aftermath he ordered a full decimation of each legion whose members had partaken in the attempt on his life.\n\nBy the time the Emperor continued on his journey east a lone rider traversed in the opposite direction bearing a letter with various orders. Among those orders stood a singular commandment that *you* hasten and make yourself available to the Emperor in Antioch...\n\n---\n\nGreetings and welcome to my ad!\n\nThis scenario will take place in an alternate history account of Roman history. The point of divergence occurs in 275, with the culminating event meaning that Emperor Aurelian survives his assassination attempt and continues on his way east to intervene in the Sassanid Persian civil war. The scenario itself is fairly open-ended and I'm more than welcoming to discussing what kind of a character you'd like to write, but if given the option I'd like for someone to write as the by now disgraced Empress Zenobia of the Palmyrene Empire.\n\nThe short and sweet on me:\n\n- Male located in GMT +2\n\n- Advanced, but non-native writer\n\n- Writes third person past tense, but will consider first person\n\n- Please be a legal adult over the age 18\n\n- Dark and mature themes more than welcome, NSFW up for discussion\n\n- Willing to write over Discord, Email and Google Docs/OneDrive\n\nFeel free to send me a DM if interested, my chat function doesn't really work. Once we've discussed the scenario a bit we can move this over to discord, google docs or whatever you as my partner would prefer!",

Pop on by for our first event; Survival of the Brightest!   \n\n&gt;No one quite understood what it was that drove Mojo to his most recent venture; a wild, destructive performance full of unwilling participants. Then again, who could ever say what Mojo was thinking?   Attention, viewership, control. Power. His driving motivations once again had him flirting with danger. This time, he gathered his participants as discreetly as possible.    \n&gt;  \n&gt;Truly, a task, given how powerful and quick some of them were.  He chose a variety, not focusing on any one group or particular sets of individuals. His best show yet, he would call it. High stakes, high rewards.    \n&gt;  \n&gt; Participants were separated into five groups, and dropped into five Sectors of his newest arena. Each Sector would prove to be more difficult than the last, with A being, in his oh so humble opinion, of course, the easiest, and E being near impossible.    \n&gt;  \n&gt; The rules, he explains, are simple. Survive. Survive, entertain. Earn your freedom. But of course, why would he tell them how?  That would be for them to discover, while surviving what Mojoworld had to throw at them, and each other. Who will live, who will die?  \n\nWe are focused in the 616-verse, but if you want to play an alternate verse, such as an Ultimates version of the character, you are welcome to! But be warned, if an alternate universe version of a character comes in, the original 616 version will be removed from the world.  \n\nShoot me a message for an invite! We are a group of varying literate-tendencies and posting frequencies, as well as styles. We aim to periodically do big events such as this, as well as free events, *and* have a social media channel for fun, on-the-side interaction!",

The format is mainly pretty collaborative with person 1 giving and action or description and person 2 or 3 replying. However this format is not particularly strict. Lengths of writing can range from simple dialogue to paragraph length dialogue and descriptions. Preferably new members are at least 16+ and all skill levels are welcome. Timewise most people are in the GMT time zone however we have some members in the EST time zone too. PM me for more details and to ask any questions.\n\nHope to see you there!",
