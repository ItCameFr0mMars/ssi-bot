            "selftext": "I want to make a roleplay server on discord (because discord has some pretty decent roleplayers). The problem is I don\u2019t know what to make so I wanna know which of these ideas people would be most interested in. I\u2019ll also be listing an age range for each idea since some are more for an older audience than others.\n\nGhosts Among Us 16+ (kinda sus ngl) - Pretty much about ghosts in a mansion trying to kill people who move into it. Lots of space for a somewhat complex backstory. However, each ghost has to have some history in the house that caused them to die there, and therefore haunt it. I had this dream before the \u201camong us\u201d memes appeared.\n\nRoyal Family Roleplay (age range not decided, definitely somewhere over 14 though.) - I don\u2019t really have a premise for this one. This one is more at random.\n\nWolves of Beyond 14+ - I was thinking, instead of this being a normal wolf roleplay, it could be more of with magical wolves and things (with various types of wolves, ex. Raptor Wolf, Dragon Wolf, etc.) I just thought of this because I used to do wolf roleplays a LOT as a kid and now I have a bunch of unused wolf OCs. Plus, I think it would be fun.\n\nDystopian Roleplay (age range not decided) - This one is also a bit random, like the royalty one. I\u2019m not on board with this one, even though I enjoy dystopian stories and stuff.\n\nThe Backrooms 16+ - This is more self explanatory. I\u2019m not sure how I\u2019ll make this work, but I will figure it out.",

            "selftext": "\n\nHey! I am looking to roleplay in the *Game of Thrones / A Song of Ice and Fire* universe. It had been a while now since the last season was over, which sadly ended in a terrible way. Still, I would like to get back into it and return to Westeros and/or Essos!\n\nAnyway, I prefer to play a female against a male character. Willing to play multiple characters when needed for the plot or **if** the story is going to be more dynamic, aka roleplaying an actual storyline in multiple locations in a bigger scale roleplay. No, I am not looking to play multiple characters for you. If we are to play multiple characters, we share the roles together and divide it. It is more fun that way! Also very open for alternative universes.\n\n\nFeel free to suggest a story for any character you prefer or if you pair them with someone. There might be book only characters or ones not in the main storyline. I am just mentioning all the female characters I am interested in playing.\n\n\n(Italic is for historic characters or ones that didn't appear in the main story, most of them are favourites by default. Bold is for favourite characters of the main storyline, whether in the show or the books, but of course feel free to pick anyone! They are in no particular order.)\n\n-\n\nThe characters I am willing to play:\n\n\n\n\n**Daenerys Targaryen**\n\n\nCersei Lannister \n\n\n**Val**\n\n\n**Arianne Martell**\n\n\n**Arya Stark**\n\n\nMargaery Tyrell\n\n\nAsha/Yara Greyjoy\n\n\n**Meera Reed**\n\n\nSansa Stark\n\n\nCatelyn Tully/Stark\n\n\n**Lynesse Hightower**\n\n\nMyrcella Baratheon \n\n\n**Alys Karstark**\n\n\nMya Stone\n\n\n*Lyanna Stark*\n\n\n*Ashara Dayne*\n\n\n*Rhaella Targaryen*\n\n\n*Elia Martell*\n\n\n*Joanna Lannister*\n\n\n*Rhaelle Targaryen*\n\n\n*Jenny of Oldstones*\n\n\n*Betha Blackwood*\n\n\n*Shiera Seastar*\n\n\n*Daena Targaryen*\n\n\n*Naerys Targaryen*\n\n\n*Princess Daenerys Targaryen (Sister of Daeron II)*\n\n\n*Rhaenys Targaryen (The Queen Who Never Was)*\n\n\n*Daenaera Velaryon*\n\n\n*Alicent Hightower*\n\n\n*Jocelyn Baratheon*\n\n\n*Alysanne Blackwood*\n\n\n*Rhaenyra Targaryen*\n\n\n*Alysanne Targaryen*\n\n\n*Argella Durrandon*\n\n\n*Visenya Targaryen*\n\n\n*Sharra Arryn*\n\n\n*Rhaenys Targaryen*\n\n\n*Daenys the Dreamer*\n\n\n*Queen Nymeria Martell*\n\n\n\n\n-\n\nThese were just few off the surface of my mind. I think I am open to some more characters. \n\nI 99% will play my characters against a canon character, as long as they match the timeline we pick and are relatively reasonable against the character. I will not play as or against original characters. I wouldn't mind which canon character you pick, again as long as it relatively reasonable to pair him with a character of mine you prefer. As long as they are *not* Ramsay Bolton, Roose Bolton and Joffery Baratheon.\n\n\nI most likely have an idea for almost every character I listed, but feel free to suggest your own ideas, too! They can be as predictable and conventional as possible, or as unique and uncommon as possible, so you don't have to go for the canon or the pairing that makes sense the most.\n\n\nI prefer to build up and to balance story with romance and possible smut, in order for the story to be engaging and immersive. I write in third person, past tense and my preferred platform for roleplaying is Discord, so make sure to give me your tag when you PM me.\n\n\nHope to hear from you soon!",

I like having romance in my rps, but if my partner doesn\u2019t want them it\u2019s totally fine, I\u2019m just putting it out there. \n\nI can either write a lot, or write small responses, I don\u2019t mind either!

I stopped a long while ago, but due to being isolated at home for long periods of time I've begun to feel the urge to pick up RP again. I mainly use discord.\n\nAs the title suggests, I'm looking for a partner (18+ only) for a fantasy RP in a more grounded world than the typical fantasy setting, and with a focus on royal family drama as well as political strife (think game of thrones). I have a well-developed world of my own that I've been worldbuilding in for many years but I'm open to a custom world of yours as well if you happen to have one you'd prefer. I'm more than open to subplots, including romantic ones  (I will be playing a Female character who is bisexual so  M or F char would totally be fine either way)  As well as collaborative plot points, in fact, it's encouraged. You must be able to write with decent grammar at the very least as well as put effort into replies. (mistakes are fine they happen.) \n\nIf interested, or have questions hit me up in messages please, I won't respond in depth in comments.",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone, a pleasure to meet you. \n\nI go by Kristina, and I'm a 25+ cis-woman craving a small community of role players to write with. As some background on me, I have over 10 years of role playing and writing experience under my belt. I consider myself one of the more old fashioned role players from the days of Neopets, Livejournal, and independent forums. My traditional role playing style is multi-paragraph to novella replies, written in third person and usually past tense. \n\nIt has been a long time since I've forayed into successful group role playing. I used to admin forums for a long time during my days before university, but I have since graduated and I am looking to find that sense of forum community in the form of a Discord server. I would love to find a few other people that might be chasing that old, nostalgic high, and be willing to help me set up a server surrounding the following:   \n\n\n* An original character driven Dragon Age: Inquisition role play. I've done plays where we take the canon roles in Inquisition and put our own OCs into it. It was very enjoyable!\n* A medieval fantasy server with the scope narrowed down (eg. one small town, a group on a quest, or situated in some kind of academy like Fire Emblem: Three Houses.) This would consist of our own lore and world building.\n* An original character driven Fire Emblem: Three Houses role play, with maybe a witchier, gothic vibe. Almost Harry Potter like?\n\nI am not that skilled at working with Discord, but I promise you I am a passionate person that likes to work hard for her server! I love writing, chatting, and making friends. If this is something you're interested in, please chat or message me on Reddit. I would love to find folks with the same mindset. Bonus points if you're nearing your mid-twenties like myself. \n\nCheers, \n\nKristina",

            "selftext": "Fair warning, this might be lengthy. I am looking for someone to RP with and maybe talk with, so be cool with OOC. I'm going to get some stuff out of the way so you can stop reading if this isn't for you. I do NOT play canon characters. No matter what we do, I will be an OC. I have NO interest in Romance. To clarify, if it happens organically, cool, I guess. Romance in of it self, or doing an RP for that sole purpose, does NOT interest me. I only play Male characters, ONLY. I play in fandoms far more than original worlds, it's just easier and you don't spend all your time trying to create the world instead of gaming. I will play NPCs and other characters to progress the story and make it so it isn't just two people standing around talking, I expect the same from you. I am a stay at home dad with a lot of free time. I am doing this to have something to do, so if you don't have a lot of free time, I don't think I'm the partner for you. I have NO interest in Slice of Life RPs. Reality RPs and stuff like that don't interest me. I want action and supernatural or powers or sci-fi or something.\n\nAbout Me: I am 30+ (Old, I know), and been RPing since I was a teenager, so, around 20 years of experience. I don't necessarily think that time denotes skill but it definitely helps. I am a very literate and detailed writer, who tries to work off of his partner but I almost always post at least a few paragraphs. I can write in third or first person, which ever works best for you. I like to describe my writing as introspective, focusing more on my character's thoughts, feelings, and observations as opposed to the room that we're standing in. If I don't know about a fandom you are interested in, I have no problem researching it or having you explain it to me. My personal favorite fandoms are The Dresden Files, D&amp;D setting, Marvel, DC, a bunch of different animes and video games as well as quite a few others. I am open to most anything and have a variety of knowledge. Big big big bonus for anyone that knows and wants to do a Dresden world RP. Love that series. Anything I might have forgotten or you want to know, please ask me.\n\nRight Now: I have no particular story or fandom in mind but I would like to do something with lots of violence and dark themes.\n\nI mostly play on Discord but I might be convinced to RP somewhere else, as long as it isn't too much of a hassle. I'm really not sure what else I'm suppose to say. Hit me up with a message and we can talk there or if you send me your Discord, we can talk there. Any which way, thank you for reading this, hope it wasn't too bad, and I hope y'all have a good day and find what you're looking for.\n\nObviously everyone must be over 18 years of age.",

            "selftext": "The dust has settled on the greatest war ever to face mankind. Fight, or go extinct. Those were the stakes, and with their backs against the wall for the last 28 years, Humanity has finally obtained some breathing room, but at what cost? Billions dead, dozens, hundreds of worlds glassed, even throwing children into the fiery crucible of war simply to trade their lives for time.\n\nEven now, fractured remnants of the Covenant continue to stalk the black of space, no longer the genocidal menace they were only a year ago, but still a dangerous threat. The Sangheilli, once a foe that had pushed Humanity into the pit that nearly became their grave, are the other half of a fragile alliance strained by politics and Human screams for the dead over what was all a lie perpetuated by three 'Prophets'.\n\nThe Spartans of the Human-Covenant War have gone down in history as legends, near mythological in their status as walls that the alien tide smashed against again and again. Propaganda posters of Spartans in olive drab armor of different makes and variants, standing in the middle of fields of dead Covenant, helping wounded Marines onto their medical extractions, even showing massive damage to their armor but still standing, still fighting. Later, others appeared. When Reach fell under the pillars of glassing beams, Spartans in multicolored, mismatched armor materialized on the battlefield, sometimes turning the tide of the battle for another few hours, another few days.\n\nToday, another generation of Spartans are brought into play, containing the remnants of the Spartan IIs and IIIs, the Titans and Greek Gods of the Great War. Now, the Spartan IVs take on the mantle, merely the likes of Hercules compared to those such as Cronos or Zeus, but Spartans nonetheless.\n\nWith a galaxy slowly heating up again around the battered remains of Humanity, the UNSC's Spartans will continue to pick up the mantle of defense. One question remains:\n\nWhat will you do?\n\n-----------------------------\n\nHiya! Long post, I know, but I'm looking for someone willing to play a Spartan from the Halo universe, post-Covenant War.\n\nCurrent ideas on where I want something like this to go revolve around a mixture of blending in and doing secret squirrel stuff, or being loud and flashy, violence of action type missions. This is something I see as ongoing, without a current end to it. I'd rather build as I go and craft an ending befitting the characters in the story, rather than a concrete ending that's played up to.\n\nPlease be at least 18+, preferably someone 20+, because a lot can go on with this prompt that I'm more comfortable with roleplaying with someone that's closer to my age. I prefer paragraph or novella style replies because I can get carried away with mine and one liners just won't do. I'm in the EST timezone, and I'm available often, but there are times I can get dragged into other things and my time is taken from me. I'm a sucker for a good romance done right, so I'd love to include that in there, but definitely don't wanna force it.\n\nSo, if this looks like something you're interested in, please message me!",

Perhaps there is complication: a disability, we're in Covid lockdown, maybe a war breaks out. If you have a particular geographical context, I'm very flexible. Anyway, he's the starter:\n\nI looked over to the woman next to me (that's you). She was the love of my life and I owed everything to her. Two years' ago, I was a heavy drinking, aimless idiot. I'm well paid in my job but it was so tedious that I'd surf Reddit in my spare time. Then one day I got a message about one of my prompts. \n\n'Hiya, I'm really interested in your prompt. I've never seen a man so interested in romance and such a wholesome starter. You made me gooey with happiness. I love the idea of carrying your baby and building a world of love where we can start our family'.\n\nI messaged back and gave my discord. After an initial roleplay and another and another, we'd graduated to chatting and voice messages. Then one night you called me. 'I know this sounds crazy but I'd love to meet you. I have feelings and...'\n\nI smiled and whispered to her. 'I can't wait. How about right now? Let's meet in the central square of our town. I'll cycle over now'\n\nThe moment we met was perfect. We smiled, we hugged and almost immediately, we kissed. We'd met so many times on line so we knew each other but this was now real. We walked for ever, hand in hand, already besotted. In line with our current roleplay, I stroke your stomach as if you were pregnant. We played along and laughed and quickly became partners in love.\n\nTwo years' later, on the sofa, in our own home. The one where we live as husband and wife. Behind the flowers I bought you and the pictures from our honeymoon is a small box. I don't know about it yet but it contains a positive pregnancy test. The one you took a few hours ago. I massage your feet and am up to your stomach when you reprise the pregnancy roleplay we've done a hundred times. 'Baby, will you love me when I'm fat?' \n\nBut tonight is different. How will you tell me it's real? How will we change emotionally and physically? Let's find out",

I have a horrible sleep schedule which means I'm up at really random hours or most of the day. I'm super understanding with schedules and hope to find a similar partner\n\nGuidelines:\n\nPlease be literate, 1 paragraph or more! Discord ONLY, 3rd person. 18+ (I'm not saying that it will be strictly NSFW but I don't feel comfortable otherwise)\n\nPlots:\n\nStar Wars (Jedi OC, all eras but OR is my favorite) romance. Any era works for me! The pairing OC doesn't have to be a Jedi - be whatever you want!\n\nCrime/Modern (can be criminal or law enforcement - up to you!)\n\nSlice of Life (I've done things like student intern (me) and professor, or maybe even working at a small cafe)\n\nFantasy: I'm new to this category but I'd love to try it out! I haven't ventured very far here but I think I'd really enjoy it if you're patient with me!\n\nAnything else! Got an idea? Send it my way! I would like for romance to be incorporated into each plot!\n\nThanks! Hope to hear back from y'all",

The world has entered a period of peace the likes of which they\u2019ve never seen. Because of this the various Huntsmen and Huntresses that we\u2019ve come to know and love have taken on more civilian lives. At any minute ready to spring into action but until they\u2019re needed they simply enjoy life. I want to take a look at what their lives are like now. Something like seeing them adapt to peacetime, try to live in a world where they\u2019re not well needed, maybe starting a family?\n\nThis has the potential to become more dramatic and adventurous but primarily I want this to be a romantic slice of life with us playing canon characters (NO OCS PLEASE). I\u2019ll be playing a female character (I\u2019m pretty fluid but best with Yang, Blake, or Ruby) but I can play opposite either male or female. I\u2019d love to discuss pairings and scenarios over PM. As far as platforms go, I\u2019m good for either reddit PM or Discord. I\u2019m a literate writer and I want the same from my partner. I prefer quality over quantity so as long as it\u2019s not just two word answers I\u2019m okay without getting novel-length responses. I also want this to be third person paragraph style. So if you\u2019re interested hit me up!\n\n(Btw I want a partner that\u2019s 18+)",

            "selftext": "I am 19 and all participants and characters must be 18+\n\nHello hello. I go by Mythic, and I'm looking for some cool people to do some Warhammer 40k rp with. I tried making a big, well written post for this, but accidentally deleted it before posting, so in an effort to save myself some headaches, and so I don't just sit around not doing anything, I decided to make this post short, sweet, and to the point, and hope you'll look past that and give me a shot.\n\nFirst and foremost, I AM NOT, NOR DO I EXPECT YOU TO BE, A LORE EXPERT. If you are, fantastic, I'd love to pick your brain as we rp, and you can lead the story by all means. All I ask is that when you reach out to me, you understand that our rp may not be 100% lore friendly, creative liberty will be used for the sake of flow and fun, and I will always TRY to be as consistent as possible. I'm not too deep into the hobby, I got a handful of minis, the Astra Militarum Codex, and quite a few lore videos watched, along with a IMMENSE passion and love for the setting. Secondly, please, for the love of the Emperor, don't try to police my writing. I don't have a post length requirement, I don't have a rpm requirement (replies per minute. See what I did there?), and, this one may be a shocker, I'm human, and will make mistakes in my writing. Roleplay is a fun escape for me after a hard days work, or when the pills don't work. It's fun and relaxing, and that's how it's gonna stay. It should be noted that, though all the above may be a turnoff, I've been roleplaying for about 9 years now. You're not getting rpk quality from me, though I've posted there in the past XD. I've been reluctant to post here because I see how seriously a lot of you guys take your roleplay. I've done it before, I used to be just like that, but it's just been too long, and I wanna just relax and have fun. This is by no means a bash, it just ain't my thing. \n\nWell, with all that said, I hope you'll give me a shot with this. I have a few ideas in mind (and I wrote most of them in my last attempt, I'm not mad, you're mad, shush!), so feel free to message with nothing in mind. If you have your own idea, or your own thing going that you wanna clue me in on, feel free to have that in your starting message, along with your age, gender, and timezone so I can keep track of things. Can't wait to see who I find on here!",

            "selftext": "It\u2019s been years since Salem\u2019s fall. The world has entered a period of peace the likes of which they\u2019ve never seen. Because of this the various Huntsmen and Huntresses that we\u2019ve come to know and love have taken on more civilian lives. At any minute ready to spring into action but until they\u2019re needed they simply enjoy life. I want to take a look at what their lives are like now. Something like seeing them adapt to peacetime, try to live in a world where they\u2019re not well needed, maybe starting a family?\n\nThis has the potential to become more dramatic and adventurous but primarily I want this to be a romantic slice of life with us playing canon characters (NO OCS PLEASE). I\u2019ll be playing a female character (I\u2019m pretty fluid but best with Yang, Blake, or Ruby) but I can play opposite either male or female. I\u2019d love to discuss pairings and scenarios over PM. As far as platforms go, I\u2019m good for either reddit PM or Discord. I\u2019m a literate writer and I want the same from my partner. I prefer quality over quantity so as long as it\u2019s not just two word answers I\u2019m okay without getting novel-length responses. I also want this to be third person paragraph style. So if you\u2019re interested hit me up!\n\n(Btw just in case of possible NSFW scenes I want a partner that\u2019s 18+)",

            "selftext": "Oceans... oceans... oceans as far as the eye could see. Her dreams mirrored her reality. The door to the balcony cracked open to let salt-filled air into the room. Curtains gently waved, playing a silent game of copycat with the water. \n\nDoor closed, shades drawn. Light poured in to the room. Groaning, the girl in the bed in the centre of the room sat up. Figures rushed around the room. \n\n\u201cGood afternoon, your highness. And may we all wish you a happy birthday.\u201d The girl nodded, mouth forming an o-shape in fatigued yawn. Birthday... oh that was right. She was 24 today, and the special date would be marked with a celebration into the night. Afternoon, though. She\u2019d slept longer than she\u2019d like to admit. \n\nPrincess Katherine Annemarie Darling had much to do before hundreds of royals, dignitaries, and philanthropists from across the world came to spend their evening in the royal ballroom of the kingdom of Salisbury, a larger empire situated on the western coast of the spot of land. Seaport monopoly, the kingdom was marked by its sunny warmth, fresh fruits and catches of fish. \n\nOf course, an empire of such magnitude didn\u2019t culminate without pushback. To the East, the kingdom of [Your Choice Name] was mountainous and rocky. Cold weather kept its people bundled in furs of every kind. Just as powerful as Salisbury, how one ranked the two depended on where one\u2019s allegiances lie. \n\nKatherine prepared for the ball thrown tonight by her parents in her honor. A celebration built from the anxieties of the king and queen that their princess had not settled down made for an invitation that reached every corner. Except the East. The invitation of the rivals and sworn enemies was never tolerated, especially in a period of near war between the two. \n\nSo, of course, the eastern king sent his predecessor in his place. Find the princess\u2014 seduce her, or take her against her will, or make her spill secrets in some other way... anything for leverage, a crucial bargaining chip. \n\nThe red gown contrasted the blues of the oceans and the blues of Katherine\u2019s eyes. Eyes clear as a mountain stream, sometimes they were cold, but always sharp. Bright sun highlighted blonde hair hung to just under tan skinned shoulder blades in waves permanently held by the omnipresence of salt water. High cheek bones, long neck, small and slender nose, defined and raised jawline, Katherine looked the part. The tiara placed atop her head solidified it. Guests had already arrived for the event and were anxiously awaiting the entrance of the birthday girl, whom many looked to seduce tonight to grow their own empire. \n\nAs such, any eastern infiltrator would not have a difficult time blending in....\n\nKate prepared to make her own entrance. Flanking her father, her mother gave her a doting kiss on the forehead before standing on the other side of the King. The three royals entered the ballroom to applause from the guests. While her parents ran off to deal with their own matters, Kate was left to her own devices and to mingle, dance, and drink with those who flocked to her.\n\nI will be playing Katherine, and you will be playing a character of your own creation. You may be any gender and craft your backstory or kingdom as you see fit. I am looking for someone with great grammar and detail so as to keep the story moving.  I write replies on the longer side unless short ones are applicable. \n\nI hope to hear from you soon, please send me a message with any questions and, if you have no questions, with your character description and a continuation from where I left off. From there, we can move to Discord or another platform",

I have a long summary of it's features in a document ([t](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G2df6K4dEt-YJIvRdlwuU_Bpj4dfP4dDGzngbQogNSI/edit#)hat I cannot link to except in dms) but the gist of things is that there is a dimension that composed out of the dreams and nightmares and emotions of people.\n\nThink of it as an amalgamation of thoughts-the more feelings are associated with an area, the more twisted it'll show up as-and the more twisted it is, the more nightmares begin to grow. These beings are started to taking over the alternate dimension and if they get too far-the world ends. That's why your unknowing, randomly chosen character has to awaken their Veni-yan-cari powers to save both worlds.\n\nSome specifications:\n\n* I'm planning for MxF romances because those are extremely fun for me lol.\n* You likely don't need to play multiple characters unless you want to.\n* The length of my posts depend primarily on how much I want to say. Maybe it's a whole bunch, maybe it's 2 lines, whatever is most effective.\n* That's all o7.\n\nHit me with a message if you're interested. Mobutt out!",

            "selftext": "It was early in the evening, but far from a normal day In the city park. Hidden in in some bushes near an out of the way trail was a large, monstrous humanoid only just beginning to wake up after being unconscious for a good while. \n\nHis name was Azeroth, he was a demon lord of of his own domain of the demon realm. His eyes slowly opened, and the first thing he noticed was he was rather beat up, and he felt a significant amount of his powers gone. He tried to piece together what had happened to him. \n\nSome of his most trusted comrades thought of him as far too soft of a demon lord, too content staying in his palace and too friendly with undeserving souls of the doomed. They conspired behind his back and took his domain from him to split among themselves, and trapped him in the human realm without access to his powers. \n\nThe demon lord debated getting up to find somewhere he could hide out, but upon peeking through the leafs he quickly realized this wasn\u2019t a the wilderness, he was trapped in a park, in the middle of a city. Today really wasn\u2019t his day. He wondered what to do in this precarious situation \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nHi! Thanks for taking the time to read my starter about the demon guy I\u2019ve been workshopping\n\nThe plot is mostly open ended and dependent on the kind of character you\u2019ll be playing. Will they assist him in carrying out his campaign of bloody revenge? Or will they help him come to terms with what happened to him and get him used to living on earth\n\nYour welcome to play a character of any gender. They can be a completely normal human, a witch/warlock, a monster/demon hunter, or anything else if just run by me, I\u2019m unlikely to say no. Romance is preferred but not required\n\nMy only writing requirements is that you write in third person, 2-4 paragraphs. I'm not picky about occasional spelling/grammar mistakes.\n\nThank you for reading!",

            "selftext": "Hey all! So I love world-building, and I love long-term roleplays, so here I am to advertise a 1x1 rp I'm really exited to try! It's set in a post apocalyptic world, where the only surviving settlements are meagre villages and one, massive city, highly advanced and futuristic. However this city is in a war. It's very authoritarian, with Android police holding an iron grip on the oppressed civilians, unless you have deep pockets. These androids have no freedom in their acts, being stripped of memories from their past lives as humans. But some aren't.\n\nMy oc is one of these androids, who was lucky enough to be given their memories after a group of rebels were able to scavenge some data of android memories. Now they're part of a resistance, dedicated to overthrowing such tyranny however they can.\n\nBut what about you? Well, I want you to have plenty of freedom. I want you to be the main character. Sure, I'll be playing most side characters, but you'll be the star of the show, unless you want a hand in managing this universe yourself. Maybe you're another android, seeking their own goals in life, or perhaps your a member of this oppressive government, possibly working as a spy against the resistance or maybe just trying to thwart my oc at every step. \n\nIf you're interested, please pm me on Reddit, and I'll provide you my discord username so I can explain things in greater detail. I hope to see you soon!",

The characters kinda know they shouldn\u2019t, but in stressful situations they can\u2019t help but give in to this strong bond to one another. Bonus points if the characters I\u2019m playing are sorta already in a relationship but are flirting and such with their relatives, secretly.\n\nFor now, I can see:\n\nKatara x Sokka\n\nKorra x Deska\n\nI don\u2019t have a concrete starting off point but I hope we can come up with something based on me playing as Katara or Korra, something has been bothering me or I\u2019m under stress, or maybe something just clicks at some point? And even though I\u2019d be having in some relationship with Aang or Mako, I\u2019d find more calm and respite with Sokka/Deska.\n\nI\u2019m looking for a good balance of adventure, everyday interactions aka Slice of Lige, and building up romance. \n\nAs for the dynamics, with Katara and Sokka I see Katara finding Sokka\u2019s goofy traits endearing especially in the stressful adventures and even in her relationship with Aang that may be loose at that point. \n\nWith Korra and Deska I think Korra having \u2018love at first sight\u2019 when she sees Deska would be pretty amusing. She wouldn\u2019t understand why she\u2019s drawn to him besides his looks, but that\u2019s where we develop it further. \n\nI\u2019m open to ideas and looking forward to roleplaying this forbidden but strong family attraction to one another, ideally on Discord.",

            "selftext": "Hey everyone! Angel here. I had a few ideas that either I've seen on Tumblr or have personally made up myself. I'll list the idea and genres they would fit. The ones in bold are ideas I did not personally make but were free to use. Also PLEASE DO NOT ASK ME TO PLAY MALE CHARACTERS! I DO NOT! (yes people constantly ask and its getting annoying.)\n\nScenario A: \"**You\u2019re a cancer patient. You\u2019ve traveled to Hawaii, for an operation, that you hope will save your life. But, while you\u2019re in the hospital, your nurse tells you the story of the Night Marchers. Legend has it, that anyone who sees their parade, will die. When you begin hearing phantom marching-band sounds at night, you start to wonder if the legend could be true.\u00a0\" \\[HORROR, ROMANCE, DRAMA\\]** \\[You can play patient or marching band leader, your pick\\]\n\nScenario B: You play a famous musician (this role is meant to fit Gerard Way but if you want to play an OC, perfectly fine by me! But I'd really like to RP with Gerard &gt;.&lt;) and you go to a coffee shop. You see a cute barista and she doesn't know who you so when you ask her to remake your order she gets snappy with you, unaware of your fame. You really like that, it has been a long time since you've been treated like a real person...what do you do next?\n\nScenario C:  **Gerard is a convict, currently serving time for murder. When he receives a serious injury, the prison warden brings him to the hospital, where you work. As you nurse him back to health, you form an unexpected bond with him. But, can you really trust a killer?**\u00a0 \\[you would play the killer here.\\]\n\nScenario D: Same beginning as B, but, (since this is MCR..gerards brother is in the band named mikey) they both take an interest in my character at the same time so it might get a little messy.\n\nScenario E: You are a small band that has been gaining traction lately and my character is a *major* fan girl. You notice she comes to every show even over seas! She has blogs dedicated to you and your band, everything about you she knows already. Your birthday, favorite food and favorite place to eat. You've always brushed her off since high school (you both grew up in the same town) so when she hears your leaving she follows suit. \\[romance\\]\\[SOL\\]\n\nI have more ideas but it would make this post WAY too long. So message me if any of these interest you or you like the general idea, we can make up one together too. \n\nI'm looking for someone in a partner who is able to reply frequently, literate (no \\* or - ). That's it really, just be able to try and match paragraph lengths...be nice and that's it lol. If you hate melodrama or drama in RP don't respond...as this has quite a bit in it.\n\nAs for me, I am multi-paragraph, descriptive, and I can reply frequently! (daily)",

Perhaps there is complication: a disability, we're in Covid lockdown, maybe a war breaks out. If you have a particular geographical context, I'm very flexible. Anyway, he's the starter:\n\nI looked over to the woman next to me (that's you). She was the love of my life and I owed everything to her. Two years' ago, I was a heavy drinking, aimless idiot. I'm well paid in my job but it was so tedious that I'd surf Reddit in my spare time. Then one day I got a message about one of my prompts. \n\n'Hiya, I'm really interested in your prompt. I've never seen a man so interested in romance and such a wholesome starter. You made me gooey with happiness. I love the idea of carrying your baby and building a world of love where we can start our family'.\n\nI messaged back and gave my discord. After an initial roleplay and another and another, we'd graduated to chatting and voice messages. Then one night you called me. 'I know this sounds crazy but I'd love to meet you. I have feelings and...'\n\nI smiled and whispered to her. 'I can't wait. How about right now? Let's meet in the central square of our town. I'll cycle over now'\n\nThe moment we met was perfect. We smiled, we hugged and almost immediately, we kissed. We'd met so many times on line so we knew each other but this was now real. We walked for ever, hand in hand, already besotted. In line with our current roleplay, I stroke your stomach as if you were pregnant. We played along and laughed and quickly became partners in love.\n\nTwo years' later, on the sofa, in our own home. The one where we live as husband and wife. Behind the flowers I bought you and the pictures from our honeymoon is a small box. I don't know about it yet but it contains a positive pregnancy test. The one you took a few hours ago. I massage your feet and am up to your stomach when you reprise the pregnancy roleplay we've done a hundred times. 'Baby, will you love me when I'm fat?' \n\nBut tonight is different. How will you tell me it's real? How will we change emotionally and physically? Let's find out",

            "selftext": "\nBeginning: Hello! I wanna try a batman roleplay. In this rp, is where it\u2019s early in bruce\u2019s batman career and you play as a female GCPD officer who used to be friends with Bruce Wayne. Your character will be your original character. She will help batman with a new villain who comes on the sene. I would like this to be long term please. But, will she finds out Bruce\u2019s identity? Who is this villain? And will Bruce and your character be more than friends? Let\u2019s do this roleplay to find out! \n\nStory: Years ago, we were kids at my house. We were 12 almost 13. We met not that long ago from school. You thought I was a nice kid, always wanted to help people who needed it. It was a afternoon, where we were playing outside playing tag. Then you came up with an idea, hide and seek. I agreed to play. I look at the tree when you ran away to hide. After counting to 30, i turn from the tree. I look around smiling and walked around searching for you. But, with with one wrong step, i hear a crack. I look down and scream as i fall into a hole that leads to a cave. I breath heavily quickly sitting up. Looking into the darkness, i see eyes looking back at me. You heard me scream, so you ran to where you heard it. You saw a hole, looking down you saw me. I look up at saw you. I yell get my dad. But me yelling echoed through the cave. I look at the darkness again and screams as bats fly around me. My father, mother, and Alfred ran to you after you told them what happened. My father got me out of the hole and i looked scared half to death. You frown and that was the last you saw me. \n\nPresent day, you were walking to the GCPD building to start your new job. After a year of training, you smiled watching people walk around doing their job. Gordon walked to you and shook your hand. He shows you around the building, then he shows you your nice size office where you\u2019ll be working. He starts you off with just taking calls. You know you can do more, but you decide to check it out. After a few hours, you get a call where it sounded bad. The person on the phone sounded in pain and weak. Saying \u201cHe\u2019s here. The Bat is he-\u201c it cuts off. You were surprised about the phone call. You slowly put the phone down wondering what they ment. You wonder if you should tell Gordon or let it go and try to solve this call yourself. (Continue from there)\n\nEnding: Thank you for reading! I hope it seems interesting to you. I do rp on discord. So send me your discord name and the word \u201cAlfred\u201d so i know you read this all.",

            "selftext": "In a world where vampires are far from fiction, a rare recessive trait causes people to turn into bloodthirsty monsters when they die. Long ago, these vampires were killed shortly after they come back from dead. In the early 1900\u2019s, it was discovered that these vampires will become sane again if they drink enough blood after coming back. These people would act and appear just like humans until they need to feed again. Since that discovery, laws have been made to protect these vampires and help them get the blood they need to survive. Humans are paid to donate blood, and the vampires pay to receive the blood. Due to the lack of aging, there are no vampires allowed under 18. It\u2019s now 2020, and it\u2019s your first year going to university. Unlike high school, the campus is of a mixed race. This roleplay is about you, a vampire, and your first time at college, while I play as a human you take an interest in. The roleplay starts with you moving in and attending your first class\n\nI can play MxF or FxF, with or without romance. I roleplay in first person but I don\u2019t care if you do first or third. I can use either Kik or discord, so DM me here if you\u2019re interested",

            "selftext": "Hello all! Im a 20 year old female seeking some wonderful partners, now that I have more time on my hands. Please be of age (18+), it\u2019s just a comfort thing for me! \n\nSpecifically, I would like to write a *romance* roleplay in the world of Harry Potter! With all the dark, angsty challenges these characters will undoubtedly face. This will strictly be Canon x Canon, but I could be convinced to double up! I am also open to hearing Canon x OC suggestions, so let me know.\n\nHonestly, just feel free to suggest *any* CanonxCanon ships or ideas to me that you\u2019ve been itching to write in the Harry Potter universe and I\u2019ll let you know how I feel about it :) I\u2019m very open to suggestions!\n\nI am looking for a specific pairing, however. That pairing is Hermione Granger/Draco Malfoy. I am perfectly capable of playing as *either* one of them and have no preference whatsoever, so let me know who you would like to play as!\n\nAs for ideas for Hermione/Draco, I have quite a few, but please feel free to pitch any plot ideas of your own because I\u2019m excited to hear them. I want to find something we can both enjoy writing about.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of one idea I had in mind for Hermione and Draco, based off of something I read:\n\nIt\u2019s been two years since Voldemort has been killed and the war had come to a conclusion. At the Burrow on a day off, Harry, Hermione and the Weasley\u2019s are surprised by the sudden appearance of a child.. covered in *blood.* The blood is not his own, but it is his mother\u2019s, from the future - something they all discover when the scared, sobbing boy sees Hermione walk out of the Burrow and with relief, cries out, \u201cMummy!\u201d (The idea is that future Hermione sends her and Draco\u2019s child back in time with a Time Turner. The child is holding a wedding ring, a news clipping and a bottle of memories. She would, of course, never do something this illegal unless it was a complete last resort. Their future world is full of death and destruction that she thinks they can prevent.)\n\n^ That is one of *many* ideas, so please feel free to ask for something that might suit your fancy a bit more. I ask that you be 18+, literate and capable of writing at least one detailed paragraph in third person, past tense. I tend to write at least four, but I don\u2019t pressure my partners in the slightest when it comes to how much they write or how often they respond. We all have lives outside of writing, so I understand :)\n\nAnyway, let me know if you\u2019re interested in playing Draco or Hermione, all plot ideas are open so suggest anything you\u2019ve been itching to write! \n\nI hope to hear from you all and am looking forward to writing with you :)",

But I'm not entirely selfish if you fulfill my wishes I can fulfill some of yours by playing a Canon for you too! ^^ \n\nI'm going to be honest, any one from the HP universe would be awesome to make an RP with. \n\n1. Snape x FC Teacher/student. Common i know...but it has good fluff and I have SO many plot points for me and snape. It would make the post w a y too long if I posted them.\n\n2. Harry x FC x Draco love triangle. I have way too many plot lines for this as well. \n\nAnd those are the ones I'm hunting down currently. Obviously all characters are adults. Send me a PM if you think you could do this! :D \n\nI'm literate, multi paragraph, and seeking someone similar. Obviously must be somewhat aware of HP lore...movies lore fine.",

I'm burnt out from roleplay, but I want to get back into my hobby of writing.\n\nI'm looking for a partner who's just starting out. It's okay if you don't post much. It's okay if you're not the best. I like cool people and cool characters. That's what I'm looking for. \n\nI'm looking for some really simple slice of life roleplay. We can include supernatural or sci fi elements, I'm cool with that- but preferably we'd be on Earth. I have some ideas relating to this concept that I can elaborate on through messages. \n\nI prefer original roleplays. Give me your original ideas and I'll try to work with you. If you're having trouble, we'll build something up together. \n\nI'm not looking for raunchy scenes. I don't mind light romance/implied pairings, however. Fade to black, wholesome stuff, etc. Let your imagination go wild. It's not what I'm here to do though.\n\nSend me a message if you're interested. Include your Discord tag. ty",

I\u2019m 18 years old and freshly out of my basic and AIT training in the Army. I\u2019m an active duty tanker and I\u2019m not sure yet on how my schedule will change through the days. I\u2019m currently in Georgia but being stationed in California on the 29th of this month so yay!!! I haven\u2019t done any role playing in a good 7 months so I can be a bit rusty until I get into a good mood for it. Please PM me somethings about you and hopefully we\u2019ll have a time zone that isn\u2019t too split up and compatible schedules. Thanks!!",

            "selftext": "\n\nLiterate ONLY \n\n\nHello, everyone! I\u2019m looking to do a Hunger Games-themed Roleplay again. I got so many great partners the last time I posted this, and I\u2019m hoping to get even more now that I\u2019m pumped up after reading the new book. This Roleplay won\u2019t contain any spoilers if you haven\u2019t read it, though. I want to include some characters from the book as older people, but only if my partner has read it. If you haven\u2019t, no worries, just tell me. I made this before the book came out, and I have the plot set up for that. I will say, though, if you\u2019re on the fence about reading it, you should absolutely do so. It\u2019s an amazing book. \n\nI\u2019m not looking to go as far back as the new book, but far back enough that we can go on without entering 74th Hunger Games territory. My character will be a male Tribute, and your character will be a previous District Victor. Because no, we are not pulling a \u201cDual Victors\u201d thing here where both Tributes walk out unharmed. There will be blooooood! Your character will initially serve as my character\u2019s Mentor, teaching him effective ways to survive. How recently your character won their games is up to you, as long as they\u2019re not as old as Mags or younger than 18. My character, naturally, will also be 18 since that\u2019s the only age he can still be reaped for the Games while also allowing good ol\u2019 legal romance to blossom. I don\u2019t care what gender you are in real life, but I ask that you play a female character for this. Speaking of characters, I\u2019ve been asked about this in the previous times I\u2019ve done this Roleplay. Feel free to give your character some sort of issues to overcome. It\u2019s not uncommon for Victors to experience things like PTSD, drug or alcohol addictions, personality disorders, that kind of thing. Though at the same time, I totally get that issues like these can be personal for some of you, so please don\u2019t feel the need to do anything you don\u2019t want to do! Oh, and my keyboard issues are resolved so I can Roleplay here now! \n\nPlease comment or message \u201cMockingjay\u201d if you\u2019ve read this far so I know you\u2019ve read everything!",

Opossums are my favourite animal.\n\nA little about you (hopefully): 21+ (or 18+ at the very least), cool with someone potentially 12 hours ahead of you.\n\nBasically, what I'm looking for is fantasy. I adore it, and I want to write some really cool stuff. \n\nI'm looking to play a main female character against a male main character. Open to having a cast of side  characters of whatever persuasion.\n\nI'm on a real fae/elf kick lately, so if you indulge me in that, I will be eternally grateful. I'm after those malicious, mischievious, human-hating kinds of fae and/or elves. I adore enemies-to-lovers dynamics. \n\nI'm definitely open to any original ideas you might have! Also down for a variety of fandoms, just throw one at me. Worst I can say is no! \n\nIn regards to the story/writing itself: I am all for NSFW stuff, I greatly prefer third person/past tense, and please have a good grasp on grammar.\n\nPlease hit me up with any interest or ideas you might have!",

Not to mention I live in basically the middle of nowhere so I find RP to be a great outlet. I only RP with adults and other literate roleplayers. I only RP in the third person and require the same of you! \n\nAs for my tastes, I prefer realism. Even supernatural themes can be realistic! Don't feel too bogged down to reality, though. \n\nI also require you have at least a year's worth of experience either writing or roleplaying. I am a horrible teacher! I also would prefer it if you could reply once a day, though I do understand if things come up or you are too tired. I myself am able to reply daily.\n\nAs for my RP type, I absolutely adore having detailed characters. That's just me though...I like to include their hobbies, opinions, and past experiences in my replies if it fits or I can include it.\n\n**favorite ideas:**\n\n*-slice of life teen/kids/young adult* \n\n*-Supernatural youth/super-powered kids and teens*\n\n*-cyberpunk*\n\n*-fandoms of Harry Potter/Supernatural/mlp/ (off the top of my head...)*\n\n**ideas I'm fine with but prefer less unless you offer to GM it:**\n\n*-fall out*\n\n*-historical RP's \\*please avoid the 20's and anything before the medieval ages.*\n\n**ideas I do not like to RP**\n\n*-pure fantasy: I overplayed it in high school and I have become burnt out from fairies and elves. I like them but I just find it a chore now.*\n\n*-fighting/action-heavy RP's. Don't get me wrong,I like action but come on...it's text, lets get creative.*",

I'm most interested in playing a gymgoer, I'm open to any characters you'd like to bring to the table, be they fellow gymgoers, instructors or just someone out to make use of the pool or spa.\n\n\nA little vague I know, but I'm more than happy to chat over the details. I'm very open to hearing your ideas also, I'm happy to play any number of characters or even make this a DM type scenario.\n\n\nI can be reached via reddit DM and can also chat over kik and Discord.

This person would, equally so, enjoy GMing, pre-fourteenth century technology, and bring with them to the table an understanding and comprehension of world history (where applicably useful) and grasp economics, trade, warfare, and other topics related to nation-management.\n\nThe intent is to organize a story told through the perspective of an individual who will, not long into the RP, rise to the rank of landed nobility and be cursed with the responsibilities of such a position. In my mind their situation is a tenuous one, barely held onto as numerous crises threaten to overcome them, demanding clever decision-making and policies to save their own skin as well as those they've been charged to protect.\n\nI write at length, appreciate inventive uses of the English language and metaphor, and would appreciate a partner whom has a Discord account for the purposes of OC chatter, not for actual roleplaying.\n\nUndoubtedly there's more to go over, but that's the brass underline of it.",

I\u2019m currently looking for a roleplay based on the Amazon series The Boys (which I highly recommend). \n\nA bit about me: \n- I\u2019m 21, and I work most of the week, this however doesn\u2019t mean I won\u2019t reply- just that it may not be instant. If you\u2019re okay with that I can definitely make it worth your while, seeing a put a lot of effort into replies. \n\n- I\u2019m literate/ adv literate meaning I can type a good few paragraphs and often try match my partner. I can write less, but nothing close to one liners or a few lines. I like to be creative with my responses. \n\n- I love to chat out of rp! Got some fanart? Send it over. A song that reminds you of the rp? Let me hear it! Pets? Lemme see- I\u2019m all for becoming friends. This in mind I often do long term rp. \n\nThe roleplay: \nI was thinking something between Billy Butcher and Hughie Campbell- seeing as there is a lot of tension between the two, and possibility for angst and fluff alike. \nSomething along the lines of the basic plot- but with these two gaining feelings and trying to fight this. \nHughie trying to push butcher away because he\u2019s scared of being like him, but her pulling him closer because he knows Hughie likes embracing the dark side of himself with him. Of course these are just a few ideas and I\u2019m down for coming up with a plot together! \n\nPlease feel free to message me! Thank you for taking the time to read this! I hope to hear from you soon ^^",

I want to make sure I like you and that we're compatible.\n\nI usually write multi-para and I won't accept someone that writes under one paragraph. I do NOT rp with one liners or semi lit.\n\nPlease write in third person and past tense. \n\nWhen we're discussing rp information, do not get aggressive. Keep calm and respect my likes and dislikes. Be positive and patient.\n\nFor the story:\n\nI'm thinking something along the lines of a slice of life or maybe fantasy of some sort?

First, The Fall, then the rise of the Eternal Night, and only a  few centuries followed where wings couldn't fly one away from the  threat of extinction, at the claws and pincers of ravenous locusts,  thoughtless in their machine-like killing of all life.*\n\n*Yet,  centuries ago, your ancestors managed to fly to safety in the clutches  of the realm of Kalkordia, far beyond the safety of the Shield  Mountains, where storms may be cold and plentiful, you hatched alive and  well, with soft feathers and a full crop. A rare luxury in these days,  as it seems everyone is getting thinner and thinner as time passes. You  also bear their ancient blood, bled from the fires of dragons, you're a  Phoenix, an individual blessed in exceptional magical skill, as they  carry their own flame within their blood.*\n\n*As  your ancestors were, you chose to carry a long-running legacy, whether  you cared for it or not, you chose to join up with one of the many  knightly orders that work to keep Kalkordia safe, the same ones that  saved your lineage generations ago. Knighted, and trained, you've found  your place among the ranks of the flying forces for light in a dark  world, The Candle-Talon Order.*\n\n*You,  just so happen to be picked as a member to embark on a mission for the  Candle-Talon. \"Of utmost importance\", they say. The clock only ticks as,  you still remain in the dark whether you're about to take off on a  routine combat flight, or an adventure of your own...*\n\n*Spread  your wings, with haste, for it's sure, that this will not be an easy  flight, and a storm is only brewing in the distance...*\n\nHey  there, this is a 1x1 in a fantasy world that I created called \"Kalkordia\", following the civilization of humanoid birdfolk. You, unfortunately, are living in what seems to be the end times of it all, as a knight, seemingly all that's left of what's pure in this world, setting out on a destiny to uncover secrets, and perform your duty to save the people of the last bastion of it all.\n\nIf you're interested, please send me a DM and I'll provide my discord!\n\nI  write semi-lit, a paragraph or two, sometimes longer. I also have copious amounts of lore detail and worldbuilding laid out for this, so if you like that sort of stuff, or have any kind of questions, I certainly have no shortage.\n\nThanks!",

            "selftext": "\u201cTo those that are in search of a job. \nI am Arlen Tombrose, the proud owner of the Tombrose mansion located in the woods north from this town and I am in search for an assistant in my work. \n\nThe regulars of this town might be familiar with the type of work I do: slaying monsters, handling curses and artifacts, creating remedies - the things that are beyond a regular villagers abilities. All of these things are quite time consuming, and while my body of servants handles our livelihood just fine, I require help in the practical part of this type of work. \n\nYour duties will include: managing my visitors and letters, fetching ingredients from either different parts of the mansion or nearby herbologists, participation in rituals and organization of my working space. \nThese activities may be dangerous, but are not lethal. All the injuries you may or may not get throughout your working time will be tended to by a highly skilled doctor. \nThe people and things I work with may be bizarre and unfamiliar, in which case I\u2019d like you to refrain from many questions. In your free time you may have access to the library to do personal research. \n\nI will be providing food, clothes, living space and healthcare, as well as a handsome reward to those that are capable of handling this job. \nApplication available through avian messengers to the Tombrose residence.\u201d\n\nThis is the message found on the town board one day. The owner of the Tombrose mansion so far has been somewhat of a mystery to the townsfolk. They never hesitate to ask for his assistance, but no one knows much about him. He is treated like a benevolent guardian of the nearby cities and villages, even if he is a bit distant. \nYour character, for their own reasons, decided to take this offering. \n\n- - -\n\nHello everyone! I\u2019m Sasha, or shoop. I do semi-lit, 1on1 rps, with fantasy elements and such. I\u2019m still a minor, so there will be absolutely no smut in the rp, just a disclaimer for all y\u2019all. In this particular scenario I am searching for an mxm romance filled with artifacts, alchemy and a bit of drama. My time is GMT+1, though I\u2019m still active most of the time. I usually rp on discord. I like to make art and stuff for the rp and characters, and other random stuff. I also enjoy making friends with my rp partners, cuz I feel like it\u2019s easier to have fun in rp with someone who\u2019s company you enjoy. Pm me if you are up for this particular plot, and tell my a bit about yourself! \nHere\u2019s a few things I like to know before we start. \n- Your timezone\n- Whether you have any things you\u2019d like to avoid\n- Any things you\u2019d like to include\n- Any questions you might have about me or the rp\n- Your favorite show! \n\nTLDR: A magician is in search of an assistant, and I am in search of a friendly rp partner!",

If you haven't seen it, it's definitely worth checking out.\n\nI have a variety of ideas, would prefer you be 18+ (I'm not comfortable rping with minors, even if it's not nsfw in nature). I have a lot of experience writing and rping, I play a variety of OCs and canon characters. I rp in novella/paragraph style. Usually about one to five depending on the reply. I love to plot and become friends preferably with the person I'm rping with. I've been a fan of Villainous since the original shorts aired and I'm looking forward to an official season.\n\nI also have an entire lore that involves OCs and canons which I would be happy to talk about, as it's been burning a massive hole in my brain. If you have any ideas as well please feel free to share them! I'm particularly looking for a Dr. Flug or a Black Hat but Demencia works as well if you have the muse for her!\n\nI prefer rping over discord, which I'll give you via DMs.\n\nSalve Black Hat \ud83c\udfa9",

Honestly, I\u2019d love to do a high school based setting or a fantasy roleplay. I. do have some ideas and a site with some settings/pairings, etc. I\u2019m also looking for some fandoms that are listed below. \nPlease be literate, be able to play both genders and write multi-paragraph replies. My intros range from a page to three on Word, sometimes a bit less. My replies are between one and four paragraphs depending what is happening in the roleplay. I'm open to mxf, mxm and fxf in no order of preference.   \nThat being said, roleplay is a hobby for me and I want to keep it like that. It\u2019s sad when it becomes a chore to reply. \nI roleplay over Discord, email and docs with a heavy preference towards docs. Please, please be willing to brainstorm with me. Introduce yourself when you message me. If you just say \u201chi\u201d or \u201cstill looking\u201d, I will ignore you. Please include the word \u2018niffler\u2019 in your message to prove you\u2019ve read this. If you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll redirect you back to my post. \n\nPlease tell me your limits! I personally don\u2019t have any triggers but I prefer no excessive gore and please don\u2019t kill my character. \n\nDM me to discuss ideas!\n\nSome fandoms I\u2019m interested in:\nStranger Things,\nGame of Thrones,\nDance Academy, \nCamp Rock, \nGreys Anatomy\nHarry Potter (golden trio era only) \n\nFor fandoms, I\u2019m mainly interested in Canon x OC pairings. I\u2019m willing to double as canons if you want an original character and I expect the same in return. OC x OC is also good as well but I strongly prefer OC x Canon.\n\nPlease send me a chat to discuss and come with ideas! Hope to hear from some of you.",

However, if you're interested in original settings, feel free to check out my other post(s), as I'm also always recruiting for those!\n\n1. I'm looking for \"advanced/literate\" partners with as much love of the language as I have (know your possessives, \"your\" vs. \"you're,\" proper comma usage, etc.).\n2. I only do hetero pairings and am willing and able to double.\n3. I'm not going to engage with you in what's mistakenly called \"mature\" content. Think PG-13 when RPing with me; I love romance and conflict, but don't get out of hand. I'm just not comfortable writing that kind of thing in a collaborative setting.  That said, 18+ partners are still preferred. I'm in my late 20s, so I'd rather stick with other adults.\n4. Email is preferred, but I can do others. Just ask.\n5. I don't do one-liners. Multi-para, please (unless the scene requires otherwise).\n\nFandoms (**my** character in parentheses):\n\n* Tales of Symphonia (Raine) \\[Looking for someone to double as/take Regal.\\]\n* Star Trek: Voyager (Janeway) \\[Looking for a Chakotay.\\]\n* Harry Potter, Trio Era (OC teacher) \\[Looking for a Remus.\\]\n* Harry Potter, Marauders' Era (Same OC as a student) \\[Again, Remus.\\]\n* World of Warcraft \\[Prefer Wrath era, but will go up to Cataclysm if necessary.\\]\n* Fullmetal Alchemist (Riza) \\[Looking for a Roy.\\]\n* Fullmetal Alchemist Post-Series (Roy&amp;Riza's OC daughter)\n* Final Fantasy XIV:ARR",

            "selftext": " \n\nSo, I am 24 years old, Scottish, and an experienced roleplayer. I've been doing it for quite a few years now, and I prefer the novel, third person style. That means no asterisks and somewhat lengthy responses, although i don't expect a thesis, maybe a paragraph or two. I also prefer to use OCs.\n\nAs for scenarios, well, there's a few I'd be willing to do:\n\n* **Star Wars** \\- Old Republic era, preferably, as that has a lot more freedom in terms of Jedi/Sith dynamic if required. I have a lengthy list of characters for this one, one of the perks of playing the MMO for years and putting a lot of care into my tools.\n* **Elder Scrolls** \\- This could take place at any time in the world, during any game. I am very well-versed in the lore of Tamriel, so there are a lot of options here. \n* **Pok\u00e8mon** \\- Just got back into playing Sword. I'm a fan of the series and I would be going for a style that's more based on the anime; after all, I don't think a Snivy would realistically do much against a great big Regirock.\n* **Harry Potter** \\- Now, this would be in a somewhat alternative universe where the H-man doesn't really exist. Voldemort MIGHT exist, we can discuss that if you desire.\n* **Witcher** \\- I'll be honest, I'm not entirely sure about this one but The Witcher III is possibly one of my favourite games ever, I played it to death and adore it. Never seen the Netflix show, so don't expect me to be well versed in that.\n\nKeep in mind that all of these are just suggestions for the worldspace. In terms of storyline, anything is possible.\n\nRomance is an option, but keep in mind that I am a straight dude. NSFW stuff I'm not too fond of, so don't expect much in the way of smut, either. Maybe along the lines of in 1984.\n\nSo, send me a PM if you're interested! I tend to RP over Discord, so let me know which world you're interested in.\n\nStay safe, a'body.",

            "selftext": "Greetings everyone,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope the weekdays are treating you well, thank you in advance for giving my post a read: I'm writing this post to find a partner  to build a nice, long-term story that has a lot of romance, slice of life, story and smut, in equal amounts. Apologize for the grammar mistakes, writing in English is a skill which I still look to polish.\n\nThe roleplay I got in mind is based on a sad background, my character no longer existing in the  world of the living but in the world of the dead. It's up to us to write the details, but there's something that is keeping her soul bound to the house, a barrier which makes her unable to live this world and have a restful eternity. Could she perhaps be freed by a potential guest?\n\nIf my small idea tickles enough sparks of interest, don't hesitate to DM me. Presenting the general guideline:\n\n\u2022 Balancing story with smut \\[ This is for  the ones which want  something more than just pure smut, not saying that smut is forbidden, but if I wanted pure smut, there are countless of interactive smuts online\\]\n\n\u2022 A role-play should be nice and fun for both sides, I believe that there are some amazing people out there and I'm here to meet people like them, if you want to give a taste to some fun role-play, don't hesitate to contact me on Reddit, we can discuss an actual plot there.\n\n\u2022 The role-play will contain adult (eighteen-year-old or above ) characters, I'm going to play my character above eighteen years old as the roleplay will contain adult elements.\n\nMy time zone: GMT+1\n\nHope to hear from you soon!  \n\n\nPS: For the ones which recognize the fandom from which my avatar and name comes from, we could also discuss about a roleplay in that universe.",

            "selftext": "Hi there &lt;3\n\nI am looking for a partner to play a (sort of) slice of life prompt in The Lord of The Rings setting. I always loved the way hobbits are passionate and caring to their loved ones, and ever since I first read the books, my twisted and romance-driven mind started with the ships. I have two main ideas I want to explore here, but I will gladly hear yours, if you have any suggestions. And I would also change the characters gender, if your idea requires so.\n\n-//-\n\n1. Frodo x Sam x Rosie: This is by far my favourite. Sam, stuck between the graces of his master and the tavern waitress. This would take place before the Fellowship, and we would play their daily life in the Shire, as the sweethearted Samwise tries to make a decision. How long will it be, until he realizes he could simply have both of them? Even though I'm a female, I would gladly play Rosie *and* Frodo. In a very optimistic reality, I may find two male partners for this, and we could play it out together.\n\n2. \u00c9owyn x Merry: This is a cute one, and it would take place before the Battle of Pelennor Fields. Seeing no possibility of surviving the upcoming battle, Merry decides to confess his love for the golden-haired horsewoman. This would be more of a short term, since it would take place in a few days before the battle, and a few days after it. In this prompt, I'll play \u00c9owyn. For obvious reasons.\n\n-//-\n\nIt may be needless to point this, but if I haven't made it clear enough, both prompts are focused on romance. I'm open to any suggestions you may have. My prefered platform to roleplay is Discord. I write betwen 1-5 paragraphs, depending on the scene, and I'll be able to post several times every day.\n\nAnd since ghosting is a common problem in this hobby, I assure you that I will not do it. If things don't work out, I will simply tell you. We can either try to fix them, or part our ways. I hope this interests you, and that you are doing fine in this world ending year. Send me a message if you're interested :)",

            "selftext": "Hi! Looking for a Spencer Reid for a Criminal\u00a0 Minds/MCU crossover with my female mutant OC. It would take place primarily in the CM universe, the Marvel crossover part is my OC being a mutant. Mentions of SHIELD and Hydra, possible appearances of Marvel characters as well. I would like to pair my character with Spencer Reid and explore her joining the BAU, and how the team interacts with her as a mutant (though they are not aware of this fact immediately, she will have to tell them at some point). She does have an unwilling background with Hydra, and presumably the BAU would be aware of the organization, that could come into play later on as well when she comes clean as an opportunity for some angst. If you're interested just dm me for my discord! NSFW themes may be included so please be 18+. I'm in CST time zone but I'm active very frequently throughout the day and stay up late often, so I'm not too concerned with your time zone. I post several times a day, though you don't have to, it's just a bonus if you can!",

            "selftext": "Hi, all. \n\nI've been roleplaying in various forms since I was 10 (forums, chatrooms, and Discord), and I am looking for some fresh ideas to play around with. I'm mostly familiar with original modern fantasy and/or dystopian settings, but in the past I've done some fandom settings (Kingdom Hearts, Harry Potter, etc). I would prefer original content but I'm not averse to fandom content or otherwise fandom-informed content. 18+ partners only, as I like to dabble in heavier themes. \n\nHere are some recent things I've done with my husband and best friend in a group setting:\n1. Post-apocalyptic, eternal night; informed by our larger scale project. Some magic elements but mostly gritty realism.\n2. Loosely mythology-informed world set in a 1920s-1940s aesthetic, where technology is allowing mortals to catch up with the powers of gods and demigods **I would love to play around with this idea more, especially with someone who has more background in myths!\n3. Larger scale project including magical elements, meta commentary, fate vs freedom, etc.\n\nI'm looking for a partner that is comfortable with a variety of settings and can be fairly flexible. I'm cool with romance, adventure, drama, you name it. I'm not the type to roleplay in paragraph form (been there, done that, and I'm in a graduate program now, so I can't, anyway). Majority of my RP life is on Discord now.\n\nFinally, as mentioned in the rules, this would be one on one roleplays, but I'm cool with including others.",

If I seem familiar, please reach out! \n\nJust looking for a buddy or two that can help write some fun stories with me! I don't have any particular ideas, right now. If you do, I\u2019d love to hear them! I love a good fantasy setting, historical setting, sci-fi, but I'm open to collaborating. Having a craving for something dark, maybe with vampires, or werewolves, demons, dragons, or magic. If that\u2019s not your cup of tea, please still message me! I\u2019m just usually NOT into Slice of Life, modern settings, or Fandoms.\n\nA little about me. I'm 27 (so please be around my age. I can't be doing this with an 18 year old, sorry. Maybe 23-24 and up?) I've been role-playing on and off since I was about 14, so this isn't anything new. I currently have one role play partner on discord, which I've been writing with since the beginning. The stories are always fun, but they're not testing my writing abilities anymore. I'm on EST, and do work full-time, but I am working from home, so I can sneak replies during the day. Reply length doesn't really matter to me, the longer the better, of course, but it's quality over quantity. I don't really have any limits when it comes to quantity. I typically play female character, but I'm open to playing both, and am willing to play multiple characters as needed.\n\nAs I said, I don't have any specific ideas in mind, I'd love to hear anything! I can also come up with an idea, if you have none and I like our vibe. Oh! Also, I don't want this to be just business. I'd like to also make a new friend, and occasionally have conversations outside the story. If that's cool with you?\n\nWell, I think that's everything! If you're still here, and are still interested, please shoot me a message, maybe start off with a joke! I look forward to meeting you!",

Shoot me a message if you have an idea you'd like to try and we can see if it's something I can manage!  \n**Warning!:** Preferably 18+ only, due to the possible inclusion of strong language and mature subjects in the roleplay.\n\nCredentials:\n\n* \\+/-6 years of roleplaying experience\n* Literate 3rd person\n* Post length varies from semi-para to novella, though I usually prefer anything between 1-4 paragraphs\n* The roleplay will most likely be on Discord, as I love how user-friendly it is.\n* I'm comfortable with most genres/subjects/plots, if you're curious if I'm okay with something, run it by me and you'll get an honest answer.\n* I prefer quality over quantity, which means that shorter posts are fine. If you're content with the post and it gives me something to work with, I'm content as well.\n* I don't mind waiting. We all have lives outside of roleplaying and it would be unreasonable to expect someone to put aside their life just to reply to a post. Take all the time you need to reply.\n* I definitely do not mind giving people advice or tips about writing if they ask for it.\n\nThat's about it, I guess.

            "selftext": "Hey all, apologise now i am using mobile so be warned of the usual issues on that front,\nI am 23 from Australia, semi-active depending on timezones, im looking for a longterm detailed rp partner interested in my below prompt.\nI will be straight up i am not looking for ERP, while those topics can be included they are not the focus\nBut because of the nature of the rp obviously touchy topics are included, and i am not a fan of censorship so dont expect that!\n\nPlease dm if interested with any questions then we can move to discord. \nPlease dont comment i probably wont see it.\n\nRp prompt\n\nPerhaps it was time to find a new approach for this little 'problem' of yours.This was a Modern day Soviet Union, i will have you imagine how the world would go if simply one man went about his day a little differently to how it should have, If a meeting ran a little late, would he still be alive?\n\nmaybe so, such things taking effect leading the mighty Soviet union never fell, and it survived into the modern world is the eventual outcome of that mans story... but who is he? maybe you will find the answer in the future.----\n\nA text came in, vibrating loudly against the treated wood of the side table, as you lay in bed the screen lit up, reflecting just enough; just in time to stop you from drifting back into a sweet dream and the embrace of that ever eluding beauty who called to you, she was gone now. \nBut now you had to see what dare ripped you away;\u00a0 taking a moment to adjust to the light you looked to find a text from a blocked phone number.\n\n\u201cBring 50% of my fee and all information at your disposal,\u00a0 beside the Vishka bar in south city between 11-12 tonight you will find a car, the passenger side door will be unlocked, if you\u2019re late the deal is off\"\n\n--This was it, this contact was what you were waiting for, whoever they were they took their sweet time ever since you were prompted to slipping a letter into an unmarked lock box at the Moscow cross-country railway....\nthis \"Person\" They were a hand for hire, working in the dark, a thief, assassin, almost anything for a few million.An associate told you that they were certainly the best, clean reliable and no strings attached perfect for the job, but they were also one of those.... things.--Remember what I asked you to think about what might happen when a man does something a little differently, well that was certainly the case in this story.\n\nYears ago a German born Russian man was shot, the bullet moved just a bit to the left and missed his heart, that man went on to become a celebrated genetic scientist in the Soviet union, creating artificial life, it was a secret for a long time, these things involved in major events, In WWll, in the survival of the soviet union, but in 1998... an article was published by an underground paper that exposed these things for what they were, how did they find out? who published this information? no one ever found out...\n\nbut this article included a full list of names, and even some photos of those in high ranking government positions, in one day it ruined many lives, but something like this couldn\u2019t be covered up, these things could be spotted by their violet eyes, while at first was thought to be a genetic issue now turns out to be an entirely different man made species of humans.\n\nMany of these things had family\u2019s with humans, relationships with children; friends and work, in a week it was gone, families destroyed, lives ruined.\n\nit was almost suspiciously quick that construction of a new area of Moscow was built and they were moved there, of course they still had to buy homes and build new lives in what is simply called \u2018South city\u2019a place where the men were reduced to work labour and many women worked as maids or other less than desirable jobs, and by modern day it was a bustling little hub, but something else grew... to some these \"Humanoids\" were fetishized, the name attached \"Violet fever\" but to most humans.. they were nothing, animals and vermin.\n\n-It was said that there are no murderers in the soviet union, as such things are such an American mindset, it helped those like this assassin you contacted, they swept it under the rug, in the instance Your brother was shot in the head? He spit in the face of an officer is what the report would say and you'd never see of it again.\n\n---Checking your watch you found your way to the neon lights of the Vishka bar in a suburban street of south city, the noise of the drunkards and the smell of tobacco of the group smoking outside, turning into they alleyway you could see the old military escort vehicle sitting there, the passenger side door was left unlocked for you.\n\nThis was it, there was no backing out now.\n\n(You can choose your own take on why you are here, (Assassination is the main i recommend), I personally recommend this character hiring the assassin is a temp, and to have your main character either the target, or an associate of said target. but it is open ended to allow your input\n\nThe start of this story after the meeting will focus a bit on the assassin (Me) so i do recommend you\u00a0 be able to play other or various characters, and hence why i also recommend why the one here is not the main.i am pretty open to your characters purpose and so on, (assassination, a doublecross, etc) the only thing i am not interested in is things like a Gang hit etc.",
