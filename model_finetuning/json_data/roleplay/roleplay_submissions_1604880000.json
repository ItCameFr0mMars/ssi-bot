It doesn\u2019t have to be canon characters, I would prefer an original setting, actually. I just like the fantasy war and tactics of it all! \n\nI don\u2019t have a preference for the plot we do, but I do wish to gm it. I love worldbuilding, so if you\u2019re into it as I am, I am happy. You can play any kind of character as well, from a knight to a noble! \n\nIf you have discord, that would be preferable, as it is easier for me to manage. I live in the cst time zone!\n\nMessage if interested! Thanks!",

I think it would be adorable to start off as first years and hobble our way up to maybe more serious plotlines. \n\nBy serious I mean obviously they still had the looming threat of Voldemort and dark wizards, blood purity, etc. I'm not one for totally slice of life types...but a huge part of me wants to just go day by day and kind of have fun being kids in a magical world. \n\nWe can focus on our social statuses, quidditch matches, grades, first loves and what not! Maybe grab some ice cream and start rumors about snape? Who knows...\n\nI'm okay with playing a mix of canon and OC, I'd be willing to play canon if you play a canon for me but I will be maining my own character! \n\nBut ultimately I just want some innocent fun! I do a lot of grim dark stuff and it might be nice to brush up on the daily lives of the students. Plus they are still kids after all, it might be fun to return to the melodrama and silly pranks.\n\nI only roleplay in 3rd person and prefer literate/semi-lit. \nObviously would only want to play with someone who's fairly aware of Potter lore but I mean...who hasn't seen or at least read the books by now? Haha.\n\nI am an adult and only prefer to play with adults, sorry! \n\nI only RP on here. Just send a message if interested.",

I'm a 22-year-old who goes to college but at the moment I'm very bored and looking for a cheesy romantic roleplay, but I'm always open to different things such as sci-fi or fantasy. I do like all my stories to have a romantic element in them though. I always match my partner's length and depending on where the story is I also match descriptiveness. I find it fun to build our own little world and just have fun there. I really like to chat on discord and I will say that I do prefer someone who is over 18 just in case, but the older the better for me. I also would like to roleplay with someone at least around my timezone so that we can roleplay in a more daily kind of way (I'm in the united states) . I look forward to hearing from you, have a goodnight.",

Also, your real-life gender identity doesn't matter to me.)\n\nHey everyone \\^\\_\\^\n\nI've seen a good amount of fantasy where magic falls out of favor and tech takes over, and vice versa. I'd like us to instead make a world where *magic and tech progress together* and are both part of the average person's life! This will be a world full of diverse creatures from your typical house cat to that grumpy slumbering dragon, and everything in between!\n\nImagine:\n\n* A knight patrolling town. A sword in her scabbard. A gun in her holster. \n* Youth cramming the night before their healing magic exam.\n* A mage looking through the spell book on his touch screen tablet. He sees the 10% battery notification and curses: *he forgot his charger at home.* \n* An adventurer, hungover from clubbing last night, trying not to vomit during today's quest. lol.\n* A world with diverse people and areas. (Some areas modern, some more medieval fantasy-like, some steampunk).\n\nHaha! I hope this helps give a good idea of what I would like us to create. I want this to be an action-adventure (so please be willing to write fight scenes). A quest filled with comedy, drama, romance, you name it! We can make the setting and the plot together! I can also give ideas if you'd like. Most importantly, I want us both to have a good time! *We're both the masters of this tale.*\n\nIf you think this would be fun, here are some basics about me. \n\n* I'm Brandon, a 24 yr old dude from the US. That, my reddit name, or any friendly titles are fine by me. \n* I usually write three paragraphs. I can write more of less depending on what the scene needs. \n   * I'll send you a writing sample of mine. Please send me one of yours too. \n* I usually post within a day or two depending on how busy I am. I'm usually around to talk though.\n* I use google docs and discord. \n* I loooove to talk OOC \ud83d\ude01. I'd really like to make a new friend.\n   * I hope we can rp long-term. :) \n* I love world building \ud83d\ude0d, playing multiple characters, and adore making things happen in rp, so I\u2019ll always strive to give you something to reply to. \n* l also have other hobbies: music, videogames, drawing, learning languages, cooking, horror movies, etc, so if we find things in common, yay!\n\nThanks for reading! Please send me a message :)",

            "selftext": "\n\nHey there! I go by the name echo and I am 17 years old (18 shortly!) RPer! I am semi literate-literate and I love history based plots!\n\nCurrently I am looking to use one character in particular of mine, his name is Vincent MacN\u00e8il! He is a World War One based character and was a soldier during the Great War. The plot I would most like to use is this:* \n\nY/C is a German medic (or just a medic) my character, Vincent, has been injured and is left bleeding out in the middle of an mostly abandoned no man\u2019s land. (Injury varies although i\u2019d prefer something a little dramatic etc) will your character save the others life, although Vincent is British? And.. if so- do they become friends? Or lovers, even.\n\nEven though this is the plot I would most like to use I have a few others and I am happy to send them in a PM or come up with plots together! I prefer the plot to be set at the end of the war (or near it) or completely after the war.\n\n\n\nI prefer MlM (bxb) relationships- I find them easier! \n\n\n\nHere is Vincent\u2019s character info:\nVincent grew up in Scotland on a tiny, very quiet and isolated island called Iona. ( as he calls it, \u00cc Chaluim Chille)  \nHe grew up speaking Gaelic (he  can\u2019t read or write in English, fun fact lmao)  he left home, and ended up renting a farm at about the age of 16 which he worked at, and loved until the age 19 where he immedately enlisted into the British army, into the highland light infantry and off to France he went. He enjoys art, it\u2019s a pastime of his and he always has some sort of small book shoved halphazardly into his uniform and a pencil, which is usually actually stolen from someone else. \n\nHe is very cheery and light hearted, it\u2019s a little put on because he is trying to keep spirits up aswell as cheer up those around him. He is cheeky and not very smart.\n\n\nHe is about 5\u20194, he is slim, Prehaps more on the underweight side of the scale, although he still is fairly strong from working at a farm for his whole life. He is very, very pale with bright blue eyes and freckles splattered across his nose and cheeks ( which usually are flushed somehow) mostly- although he has some more dotted elsewhere where. He had chin length  curly dark brown hair, which is usually tied up haphazardly at the back of his head.",

A little info about me, I am twenty five years old. I have been role playing for at least half of that time. I love fandoms and slice of life an the ocassional historical fiction and fantasy role plays.\n\nNow when it comes to a partner. I am a little particular. Please be able to write in third person past tense. As well as multi. paragraphs. Now I'm not meaning novel size posts (which I wouldn't mind), but give me something more than just a one liner. I prefer to play female in a Mx F pairing. Having said that, I do not mind doubling so we both get to play both genders. That way we can get the pairing we want and it would be fair. Last thing, please do not god mod and take over playing my character. You play y ar character and I will play mine.\n\nAnyway! Now that all that negative Nora stuff is out of the way, on to the fun stuff! Like I said, I LOVE Fandoms and slice of Lifes. I also like taking books, shows, movie ideas and just making an AU with all Ocs. Below are some fandoms I like to play. If there is a \\* next to it then I have a plot idea for it. I also put the pairing I am looking for with the character I would love for you to play on bold.\n\n* Teen wolf \\* (**Derek** x OC)\n* Criminal Minds \\* (**Morgan** x OC)\n* Once Upon A Times\\* (**Hook** x OC)\n* Chicago PD / Fire\\* (**Severide** x OC) (**Halstead** x OC)\n* Marvel\\* (**Cap/Steve Rodgers** x OC)\n* Outlander\n* Power Rangers\n\nAs for Slice of life. Please have some idea in mind when messaging me. Speaking of which, I only rp over discord, So when you message me send me your discord handle. Any messages that just say \"wanna rp?\" to some degree, will be ignored.",

I would  love to have the opportunity to  be a solution for you. Come to me with any unfinished, ghosted, or  fandom role-play and I will do my best to  fill the gap so we can have a  wonderful story telling experience. I'll try my best to fit the tone and  demeanor of any character  picked up or we can go in a whole different  direction. I usually prefer  playing male to female counterparts, but I  can try and write for what the situation calls for.\n\nAs  for the writing style I usually aim to have anywhere between 200-500  words and in the 3rd person. I\u2019m not going to say I\u2019m the strongest  writer, but I  try my best. As far as frequency goes  at least once  per day would be ideal barring real life obligations. OOC  conversations  are very much welcome as we can  brainstorm ideas to  develop characters  and bounce ideas off of each other.\n\nI'm 18+ and need all participants and characters to be 18+ as well.\n\nFeel free to Message if you're interested!!",

The largest is the first section which revolves around horror plots I have, feel free to skip around to find your preferences. If I don\u2019t have a genre or fandom listed, that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not open to it!**\n\nHello! I'm currently looking for a long-term RP partner who enjoys original world or fandom based RPs! While I have a couple ideas, I am more than happy to hear out my partners. Below I\u2019ll start with the horror genre, but if that\u2019s not your thing, feel free to skip around to fandoms or other genres!\n\n**Please note that I am looking for romance as well for most of my plots/roleplays, though I only write MxF in which I play Male. If you aren\u2019t wanting romance, let me know ahead of time as to certain plots I am willing to do without, while others I\u2019m not.**\n\n***Horror:***\n\n**St John's Hostel**\n\nThis is an idea I have that centers around the employee's of a hostel that sits almost 15 miles away from the nearest town. It sits on no maps, and googling it will give little to no results. The premise is that all things supernatural and abnormal seem to happen. Whether it be weird guests, serial killers, cannibals, Bigfoot/Sasquatches, or something else just as abnormal. The employee's are more than aware and accustomed to things that go on. Such as 'avoid the screams from the basement that happen every night from 2:11 am to 3:49 am.' Or 'Don't leave meat outside for the wildlife on a Wednesday night.' Then there is the high mortality rate of customers. It's not unlikely to find a man turned into mincemeat, or see some wild beast making its way off with a body. Though it seems most employees are exempt from these cruel fates, long as they know what they're doing.\n\nIn comes your character, a new employee working there for whatever reason, and completely oblivious to the state of things and what's happening. Their background and reasons for being there are 100% up to you, so long as they aren't familiar with the abnormalities.\n\n**Green light**\n\n**\\[Based on the world of 'Control', 'Alan Wake', 'Quantum Break', and several others with similar themes\\]**\n\nSo while this is far from the most thought out idea I have, it's one I would love to utilize. Generally another example people have added it to is 'SCP.' which is also a semi-accurate portrayal.\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Control (FBC) is a clandestine United States government organization tasked with the containment, study, and control of paranatural phenomena. Operating on a national scale, the FBC investigates events and objects which violate the scientific laws of nature, with the goal of understanding and controlling these elements. The Bureau's headquarters is a mysterious Brutalist skyscraper in New York City known as the Oldest House, which exists outside of ordinary reality.\n\nThe FBC is responsible for both the scientific study of paranatural elements and the protection of the nation (and humanity as a whole) from these forces. Among the phenomena studied by the FBC are Altered World Events (AWEs), Altered Items, Objects of Power, and other realms and dimensions. The Oldest House, itself a paranatural location, serves as a containment and study facility for these types of phenomena.\n\nI would love to do something involving this theme, granted I'm not married to it, and everything is open for discussion. Alternatively I am also open to it not even being revolved around the actual group/organization but instead something that would be cause for alarm. Such as a semi-large scale event or being. I would love to discuss this one!\n\n**Conspiracy**\n\n**Based on an old show, and short horror series\\]**\n\nConspiracy is somewhat akin to St John's hostel, though instead of following a desolate location, it takes place around a small town of just under 10,000 people. It's most notable features is that it sits right on the border of Oregon and Washington \\[though every resident claims it's only one of the two states.\\], it's lack of actual location on most maps and registries, and finally the amount of woodlands and nature that surrounds it. However there is a special thing about the small town. It is a hub for all things supernatural and horrific to come around. From beasts that claw their way into homes to feed on those who were unfortunate enough to lock their door, to small creatures that steal simple jewelry at night. From werewolves to a land shark, nothing is off limits. With the abnormal amount of death toll, it stays oddly populated for several unknown reasons. Some of the people in the town acknowledge what happens, while others pretend that it simply doesn't happen and put it to the back of their mind.\n\nEven so, there are several sinister things going on that stick out just enough if you were to look for them. From a small wake that seems to always stay in business due to the horrible events, to a small diner which you can swear the meat doesn't taste like anything you've ever had before. Or maybe the fact that the small abandoned carnival in the woods turns on for one hour every Saturday night at midnight. And finally the biggest fact, being that it is home to several serial killers that rarely make the news.\n\nThe plot and story are open on this, but I do have several ideas in mind along with a character, though I am glad to hear any suggestions or ideas.\n\n**The Bayous | A \u2018Conspiracy\u2019 location with a more eerie feel.**  \n*This is still part of the conspiracy prompt, though gives the option of another setting that focuses on a more swamp based environment instead of something set in a more forest-like location. All the information given about background is still relevant!*\n\nSet in a different location but still part of the Conspiracy prompt, this focuses on another small town. Located in Louisiana. Unlike the other, this town is all about making a name for itself.  \nA variety of claims seem to have made the area a local tourist attraction, despite the amount of gruesome deaths that occur constantly.  \nBecause of this, the local town set just a few miles down from the swamplands seems to have become bustling with activity. Attracting all kinds of attention from media outlets to horror enthusiasts who want to get as close to the real thing as possible.  \nFrom horror themed carnivals to the local drive-in featuring horror movies, it seems that this town place has really leaned into the fame it\u2019s gotten. Many of the locals also seem to share in this love that their home has gotten.  \nThough even with all the tourism and names, very few locals actually wander into the swamps. And those that do make sure to be back by the time the sun is down.\n\n**Slaughterhouse**\n\nA recent string of mass disappearances cause a stir in the nation. The most recent being an entire town's worth of residents to have just disappeared. One of the biggest reveals being a drone shot that showed the words 'CROATOAN' spray painted along a police precinct. This immediately attracted the attention of the media from outside the nation. Because of this, the event was dubbed 'The Roanoke Disappearances.' after the famous colony that seemed to have shared quite a few things in common with the most recent.\n\nHowever this story follows not those left to look behind the disappearances, but the disappeared. Awakening in an alternate world which could be described as a broken mirror of the original. People are forced to kill each other and extra dimensional beings and beasts told only in story for spot. Mostly to appease some kind of beast.\n\nThere is no meaning of fair. People of all kinds are forced to go up against each other. From the elderly being thrown into a death match between a pro wrestler, to an office worker having to fight a pack of mutated wolves. The word 'bloodbath' does well to define this.\n\n\\---\n\nWhile the plot revolves around those forced against each other in a broken world, it's more than open for discussion and nothing is set in stone! If you prefer them forced into a hostile world instead, I can happily work with that as well!\n\n**Blood and Snow**\n\nThis one is based off of a small animatic called 'Let's Split Up.' I'm a huge fan of horror films and slasher films. Not to mention Native American mythology. The idea is that it follows two shape shifting wendigo during a blizzard in the mountains. Unlike previous winters, it's reached the lowest temperatures in the last 50 years, not to mention that everywhere seems to be snowed in. With a brutal storm the two are forced to co-exist as a bunch of camp counselors celebrate and party. Set in the 80's. The biggest difference is that one wants to slaughter and eat their way through them, while the other isn't so keen on killing off everyone immediately. While this does rely on two wendigo, you can easily have your primary be human.\n\n**Something based on slasher movies**\n\nIf you've seen any slasher movie in your life, then you already know what's up. Looking for something that really hits the old school feel akin to the movies involving Jason, Micheal Myers, Ghost face, and all the like. Characters and ideas can be discussed, everything is on the table!\n\n**Something much more Lovecraftian or eldritch horror**\n\nI would love something that really leans into eldritch and general Lovecraft territory. Now word of caution, I am far from the most knowledgeable on this, though I do have the power of google on my side. Generally I love having it set anywhere from WWI all the way to modern day. Though personally post-WWII or post-Vietnam are my favorites but just a bit extra. I love seeing the characters out of their depth, against unreasonable odds, surrounded by monstrosities that should be non-existent. From deep ones and their semi-human offspring, to curses that have plagued families to generations. Not to mention all the cults we can get to see! The options are endless!\n\n**High rise**\n\nThis plot revolves around what seems to be an undetermined number of floors in a high rise building. \\[The highest known is 160 just in case you want to know what the maximum possible was.\\] People awake starting on floor 1. With all exits locked, and nothing but the clothes on their backs people are forced to make their way up. Most stairs and elevators seem to be useless on most floors, instead forcing those to find what is a makeshift path to the next floor. Every window seems to have been blacked out, and heavily reinforced, leaving minimal lighting unless whoever designed the twisted enviournment sees fit to add more. Each floor has some sort of sick game that those who make it up are forced to survive. These are not tied to the rules of reality. From sicking wolves, to dealing with the undead. Weapons, supplies, and everything else is scarce. Some floors seem to be unhinged from reality, spanning what could be miles or even new environments that are impossible to be contained within a building. The farther in our characters make it, the less things can be explained.\n\nA lot of this is up to us and how we want to decide things. We can keep it ground in reality, but I\u2019d personally prefer it if we didn\u2019t. We can discuss what we want to see from the plot and general settings for the floors. Not even the sky is our limit!\n\n**A quiet little town** **\\[Based on Silent Hill.\\]**\n\nSeveral strangers wake up in a small town inhabited by locals. With an eerie mist that seems to block any bit of vision just past the woods, they are forced to figure out how they got there, and why they are there. The residents of the town seem to be very few, but those that are there belong to a cult that worships a monstrosity that seems to also be hunting down the unlucky survivors.\n\n**Hostile Territory**  \n**Inspired by the series \u2018Manifest Destiny\u2019 and \u2018Primal\u2019**  \nThis prompt follows a pre-modern fantasy horror setting. Most notably during anywhere from \u20181000\u2019 AD to the early 1800\u2019s. It also allows for an \u2018AU\u2019 of our world\u2019s history, so don\u2019t feel the need to follow specifics if you want to have fun! **This can also be set in another setting and timeline, if you would rather a vibe much more akin to \u2018Primal.\u2019**  \nThis follows settlers and their expedition to America, Or an expedition of the Western US after it\u2019s purchase, all the way to the time of the Oregon trail.  \nThe idea is that this follows unfamiliar territory, hostile with natives and other problems. Though many unreal, and abnormal. From beasts that should never exist, to carnivore plant life and even hive mind infections. It follows those trying to survive and reach the end, with no option to turn back.  \nThe idea is that this is unfamiliar territory. The big three options are during the early 1000\u2019s AD, where the vikings Discovered America. Or during an alternate history Expedition of the Louisiana purchase. And of course there Oregon trail.  \nPlease note that we have more freedom, and we can even have it set somewhere else as mentioned above if you\u2019re looking for a much different setting or something more akin to \u2018Primal.\u2019  \nWe can always discuss this, and there are A LOT of options on the table!\n\n**Last stop.**  \n**Inspired by bloodride \\[Which I never even watched, just saw some art of it.\\]**  \nThis prompt revolves around those who find themselves trapped after boarding what should have been a normal bus just after midnight. Their reasons are all different, but without much matter. What does is where it\u2019s going.  \nThe bus seems to be untethered to reality. Without any real driver, it trudges forward through an uncharted route. Those that look outside will see something different. From desolate wastelands, to ruined cities.  \nThe bus seems to always stop at a new location, a doorway into a different world. All with some kind of horror. Some that seem to be a desolate desert with no end in sight, from those that seem to be bustling with people  \nThe bus often demands fuel at these stops before once again continuing. In most cases, it ranges from something simple such as gasoline, to less realistic options such as simple jugs or water. Though in other cases, less savory demands are made, such as blood from a specific animal species or even those of the living.  \nThe bus seems to have no set times, with some drives between worlds taking merely minutes, while others have gone for almost a whole week.  \nThe most notable thing is that despite having no driver, there is a disembodied voice which acts as a guide in a way. It answers most questions, and even has something to chime in at times. The voice has promised those that make it to the end salvation, but refuses to give more information than that about their destination.  \nThe only light is that the bus acts as a safe haven, along with a good couple meter circle around it.  \n\\---  \nThis prompt personally isn\u2019t the most detailed, as I prefer to go into specifics and come up with circumstances with my partner.\n\n**Terror Infinity**  \n**Inspired by the series of the same name.**\n\nFor those who are unfamiliar with the series \\[which I won\u2019t be surprised if most are, it\u2019s not exactly big, and it\u2019s foreign.\\]  \nIt follows those who are forced into \u201cGod\u2019s Dimension.\u201d Which happens to be an endlessly moving speed rail that has quite a few rooms. The whole idea revolves around that groups of people are brought into this mysterious world and forced into famous horror movies, games, and other settings with a clear goal and purpose to survive.  \nThe idea is that they get \u20181000\u2019 points for surviving a single event, and they have no choice in avoiding it.  \nThe reason for these points? It cost 50,000 to go back. Which means that at a minimum 50 \u2018events\u2019 must be survived. Though that\u2019s only if not a single point is spent.  \nWhat can they be spent on? The most common seems to be immediate healing upon return, which can vary from only a couple points for smaller wounds like cuts and damage, to up to a couple hundred for large scale wounds like an amputated appendage. With nearly a thousand being used to bring someone back from the brink of death.  \nThough those can also be used to increase \u2018stats\u2019 such as physical strength, buy weapons, ammunition, and all kinds of things. Even supernatural abilities.  \nThough that doesn\u2019t make anything easier, the more movies the group survives, the harder they get.  \nThere is quite a bit more to this, but I\u2019ll save that for DMs in case anyone is actually interested!\n\n**The zombie apocalypse**\n\nI have a ton of zombie apocalypse ideas as well! They will also be listed below.\n\n**1) Welcome to the freak show!**\n\nIf you've ever played any zombie video game, there is a high chance that there is more than just your run of the mill 'zombie' from undead that seemed staggeringly strong, to ones that explode when you get close. These mutant freaks seem to be an uncommon breed, but by no means rare! I would love to focus on a world that includes these mistakes of nature and much more!\n\nSome examples: Days gone, Dying light, Left 4 dead, The last of us, Dead island, And more!\n\n**2) Second generation survivors!**\n\nA generation is typically 25-30 years depending on who you ask. For this I'm specifically looking at an apocalypse that takes place anywhere around 50-60 years after it had become global. Meaning our characters \\[And most likely their parents.\\] would be born into a world that was already brought to ruins. This would mean that the undead would not be considered the same to them. Zombies seem closer to a wolf or rabid dog than a person who has passed away and reanimated. People have become used to their lives in communities and actively have little fear for the undead, typically leaving them alone.\n\n**3) A family favorite game show!**\n\nIf you've ever heard of 'Dead Rising 2' then you might be familiar with TK and his incredibly popular show 'Terror is Reality.' This idea takes a bit of inspiration from it. In a world where the apocalypse was just narrowly avoided, cities and towns which had infections spread or breakout would often be quarantined then cleaned out by professional companies. In comes a new reality show all about survival. With a $100,000 cash grand prize for winning, players must survive an entire year in all matter of places. From private islands that are full of starving infected, to the quarantined streets of Hollywood. The catch? Death is around every corner. With no medical relief staff, and other players gunning it for the money. Will you risk it all for the hundred grand? Or split the winnings and play it safe?\n\n**4) Time's Arrow!**\n\nWho said the apocalypse has to be set in the modern days? I would be just as happy having it set in a historical time period. Peak of Rome? Sure! Vikings fighting back draugr? Of course! There are so many choices to choose from! The sky's our limit!  \n\\[Please note, I'm primarily looking for time periods before guns advanced past muskets and flintlocks.\\]\n\n**5) Through the fire.**\n\nWhen the apocalypse initially rained down, everything of course was quickly thrown out the window. But where was the military during this time? The idea follows a small squadron of soldiers and civilians trying to make it across an apocalyptic united states of America in hopes of finding a cruise ship that has been giving out radio signals for the past several weeks. The catch? They are in need of a person who knows how to sail a ship long-term in hopes of reaching the Hawaiian islands. A member of the navy who happens to hold this specific skill is accompanying them. Though many trials await them on their journey.\n\n**6) Through the unknown.**\n\nNot all zombies are caused because of a virus. Some are products of a curse or a bokor/caplata. This voodoo/black magic always has a source, and our characters are part of the expedition team to put an end to it! Of course several cliche characters are perfectly fitting for this idea. From the ex-marine who's now a mercenary, to the science loving geek who knows just about everything that's happening. The effects for the 'apocalypse' in this idea can be limited to just a single city/town all the way to the entire country/hemisphere. This focuses greatly on being in a developing country or tribal land!\n\n**7) Abandoned colonies.**\n\nAfter seven decades of colonizing mars, humanity found its future bright. With new innovations and technology only thought to be of science fiction constantly being developed, they started to become self reliant. Dome shaped colonies fitting families, and all kinds of scientists seemed to be doing exceptionally well. Though things take a turn for the worse when communications with earth shut down along with several other colonies.\n\n**8) What comes after.**\n\nI would love something set \u2018after\u2019 the initial apocalypse has come and gone. With most undead finally having withered away, minus a few large groups here and there that are in quarantine zones that have been closed off or become inaccessible by any means for the undead to escape. \\[For example 20 foot walls build around that would require someone to climb a ladder and such. Not the best example, but you get the idea.\\]\n\nPretty much this plot would focus on what comes after the initial apocalypse. The rebuilding of America \\[or another country\\] after things have come and gone leaving the world scattered. The time since the initial apocalypse started can be anywhere from a good 4-75 years. \\[4 is assuming the bodies decay at a normal decay rate, leaving them pretty much gone after 4 years. Anything above that would more closely follow the idea that they aren\u2019t bound to normal decay like most zombie movies or shows seem to keep as a factor.\\]\n\nThe finer plot details can be discussed in DMs, but I would love to really see how new societies have taken to handling things in the world. From ones that have pretty laid back laws and demands, to ones that are so strict that even stealing can lead to a death penalty. I would also love to see some form of \u2018universal currency\u2019 but we can always discuss and plan that out later.\n\n**9) Ground Zero**\n\n**Inspired by #Alive**\n\nWhile I love the apocalypse once it\u2019s been established, this prompt specifically follows our characters from day one, ground zero. Where the first of infections took place, leading to the mass spread.  \nI have two options for how it starts in this situation. The first is by physically spreading the normal way, which will have more of a gradual turn across the states and world as things go in a downward spiral. In this situation, we\u2019ll see our characters traveling across America \\[or another country\\] to find a safe haven. Some places seemingly free entirely of infection, and others that haven\u2019t quite heard the news. Where money is still being used, and our characters are able to find a sense of normality, to places that have no human life left, and are littered with the infected.  \nThe second being that everyone with AB- blood type \\[Around less than 1% of the population.\\] are immediately infected by a mass mutation of rabies, while those of other blood types only react to the normal way of spreading. Because of this, infected pop up pretty much everywhere within 24 hours, leading to a mass infection that overcomes the world easily within a week or two at most.  \nDepending on which we go with, it\u2019ll leave a very different world. The second will have a lack of normality and safe havens, along with real government response, while the first will have quarantine zones, carpet bombings, and much more! We can always discuss it!\n\n**10) And the rest!**\n\nOf course I am open to many other ideas, and not just what is on the list! If you have a specific one in mind, go ahead and tell me! I'm more than happy to hear you out!\n\n**That's all the ideas I have for anything horror based now, but feel free to let me know if any interest you, or you have your own ideas as well!**\n\n***Fantasy:***\n\nSo when it comes to fantasy, I\u2019m primarily looking for a roleplay partner who's interested in something set in the world of **Dungeons and Dragons or at least a world with many fantasy elements akin to it!** While I'm more than happy to take elements and 'homebrew' races, magic, and more, I do generally want the idea to be set in a world of that setting. I have a small couple of ideas in mind, but am more than happy to hear out any you may be holding!\n\nWhile fantasy is my primary interest, I am open to all sorts of it timeline/era wise. From modern to medieval, to anything in between! Even sci-fi/cyberpunk works with me! Please let me know what your preferences are so I can take that into account!\n\nI also have nearly no triggers, so don\u2019t be afraid to come at me full force! Though if something is too much for me, I will let you know! I will gladly hear out yours as well and make sure that no elements akin to those are involved in the roleplay!\n\nNext off, I have several characters ready to be used, all various races. **I am more than happy to let my partner choose which one interests them the most!** Please note that none of them are required to be used, but it\u2019s my primary interest in using them!\n\nWhen it comes to romance involved, I do slowburn, fast burn, middle ground, and anything else in between! I\u2019m also fine with other situations like arranged marriages, already together, etc. Please let me know your preference on this one as well so I can take it into account while we plot/world build!\n\nAs for my partner, I'm fine with a fair amount of races.\n\nBelow are those races \\[off the top of my head.\\] **Please note I am open to ones not on the list, this is just from a quick jot down. Feel free to ask about any you may be interested in!**\n\n*- Human*\n\n*- Most types of Elven*\n\n*- Tiefling*\n\n*- Genasi*\n\n*- Half-orc*\n\n*- Aasimar*\n\n*- Triton*\n\n*- Yuan-Ti pureblood*\n\n*- Kalashtar*\n\n*- Changeling*\n\n*- Simic Hybrid*\n\n*- Vedalken*\n\n*-OC races*\n\n*- Most humanoid races in general.*\n\nI enjoy both light and dark themes, so feel free to come for either! *Please note I will NOT play the role of a GM, looking for a partner, not a player*\n\nI\u2019m also more than willing to discuss other worlds and do things other than high fantasy. Low fantasy is welcome as well!\n\n***Sci-fi/Cyberpunk***\n\nAnother genre I love! While I generally enjoy having multiple races in sci-fi/cyberpunk, it is far from a requirement. Much like fantasy, I do have a cast of characters that can be used, but none of them are required to be thrown in!\n\nFor this I generally enjoy all kinds of plots, from detectives/mysteries to hardcore action. Whether it\u2019s laser swords, high tech guns, or body augmentations, I\u2019m always interested in most variations of this genre!\n\n***Other genres***\n\nI\u2019m also open to nearly all other genres. **Modern. Super-heroes. Slice of life. Romance. Drama. Angst. Historical. And much, much more!** If you have any specific plots or genres I haven\u2019t gone into, don\u2019t be afraid to hit me up and ask me about them! I normally would write more, but at the moment this ad is already quite long, and I still have to go into the fandoms and myself.\n\n***Fandoms:***\n\n***Please DO NOT ask me to write canon to your OC!

Preferably with an OC that I recently have gotten designed, as I don't really write any canon villains for my primary.\n\n**Devil May Cry:**\n\nI'm thinking that it should take place post DMC 5 (Most likely several months at least). While I don't mind if you play canon or OC, I'll be having my primary be Nero. I would love it if after the events of DMC5 that things involving devils became much more common knowledge! Possibly leading to the infamous 'DMC' getting quite a bit more work and calls, possibly even to the point where they are overwhelmed.\n\n**Borderlands:**\n\nI'm more than fine with OCs, but I heavily prefer canon characters. As it goes, I'm looking for anything in the borderlands universe. So all the games/settings are open to me. While I do want something based POST-BORDERLANDS 3 or AU Borderlands 3. It isn't a must. I can do anything from Borderlands, Borderlands 2, Borderlands: TPS, or TFTB!\n\nIn the case of writing a canon character, I'd heavily prefer August, or Rhys.\n\n**Star Wars:**\n\nSo for timeline wise up to the 'Mandalorian' is fine. I'd prefer if it was set during the time of the inquisitors. In the case of me playing an OC I can gladly do a Sith or a Jedi. Possibly even a force sensitive bounty hunter.\n\nIn the case of me writing Cal kestis, I'd prefer if it took place not that long after the events of SWJ:FO. Though this can be discussed.\n\n**AND MORE!**\n\nI have plenty of more plots for fandoms, but the ad is getting quite long already, so I'll leave it here!\n\n***About me:***\n\nA bit about me! I'm just your regular dude who enjoys camping, hiking, horror movies, coffee, and several other things, but I can tell you about that later!

And then weekends I'm pretty active as well. When it comes to post length I tend to match my partner, so whether I'm giving 10 sentences or 10 paragraphs, I'm always able! I can do novella length happily! I'm 21 and have no triggers, and am willing to delve into more mature or sensitive themes, though if something is a bit much for me, I'll let you know.\n\nI love talking OOC with partners and generally try to keep a good friendship with them if they're down for it. I won't share any info about my real life, as I've had stalkers in the past. So if I don't show you pictures of myself, or won't talk about certain aspects, please don't be offended.\n\nI actually have commissioned art for A LOT of my characters, and am more than willing to show them! I also prefer to stick to discord when it comes to a medium/platform, but I'm more than willing to discuss other options. I will not use kik/telegram.

The Arbiter is a powerful, but fairly typical Star Destroyer which has been tasked with assisting the new Galactic Empire in maintaining order and peace. Are you perhaps one of our brave Stormtroopers, who form an unstoppable line against traitors and insurrectionists? Are you perhaps one of our famous high flying pilots who protect the vastness of space from pirates, terrorists, and even space creatures? Are you one of the commanding officers who courageously lead the forces of the Empire to victory? Are you one of the Inquisitors, Jedi who have seen the error of their ways and decided to rejoin the galaxy as warriors of truth instead of their former treachery? No matter your position, we\u2019d love to have you on board as we travel to distant planets across the rims to keep the peace and save the galaxy. Sign up today! \n\nThis is, clearly, an RP that takes place within the side of the empire. Now this doesn\u2019t change the canon of whether or not they were the heroes, it more gives perspective on why people fought for the empire for intentions both good and bad! You are one or perhaps if you\u2019re skilled multiple member(s) of the Arbiter. In your application discuss your character ideas, maybe story beats, and conflicts you\u2019d like to see explored! I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts and ideas. And of course, may the force be with you.",

It broke your heart and I acted terribly. \n\n10 years later, you're engaged with a boring but rich man. He provides for you and there's a big wedding to plan.\n\nI've been travelling the world as a medic. I got better qualifications and had a very early marriage with a fellow medic. Several years on, we're divorced and I've come back to my hometown. I'm bigger, hairier, more muscular, a lot more confidence.\n\nI don't intend to seek you out or date you but if we meet, I'm going to apologise. Explain that I was young and stupid. I'm a father now and I understand life a little better. \n\nWe bump into each other and after the meeting you reconsider your life with the rich guy. The lack of passion, the boring country club, the same package tour holidays.\n\nI'm currently living in a mobile home by the beach while my new home is ready. I'll be working as a doctor in the clinic. Just to cover maternity for the last doctor. But it gives me a small period of stability, a time to save and maybe a ladder to a bigger thing. Or I can travel again. It's just I've no partner in crime. \n\nThe thing is: I loved the family life but my ex wife wasn't the one. The travel I love but I want it to be with someone I love. Then maybe I can settle down. Start another family. House in the suburbs. Boring contentment",

Make sure you read what I'm looking for to ensure we are a  good match but feel free to jump around as this is rather long.*\n\n\ud835\udc68\ud835\udc83\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc96\ud835\udc95 \ud835\udc74\ud835\udc86...\n\n\ud835\udce3he names JuJu or Venus, it\u2019s a pleasure to meet you! I\u2019m a twenty-year-old female with way too much time on my hands. I\u2019ve been RPing for about seven(ish) years, though I honestly don\u2019t remember when I first started.  I\u2019ve used many different sites but mostly stick to discord and a few forum sites nowadays.\n\nSo a few things to expect out of me that aren\u2019t exactly writing-related but pertain to me as an RP partner. I love to make graphics and playlists to go along with RP and our characters, it\u2019s just something that I find  fun. I also rather enjoy out-of-character, anything from just general chatting to gushing about our characters. I feel like the RP always lasts longer when there is communication, so at least decent chitchat and the ability to communicate when something is wrong is a must!\n\n***My Writing Specs***\n\n*\u25c9 Multipara - Novella (Quality over quantity)*\n\n*\u25c9 Third-person preferred.*\n\n*\u25c9 Can write male, female, and non-binary characters.*\n\n*\u25c9 LGBTQ+ Friendly, give me all the pairings!*\n\n*\u25c9 Characters of all races.*\n\n*\u25c9* *Fan of Dark Themes*\n\n*\u25c9OOC fanatic.*\n\n*\u25c9 I can write multiple characters*\n\n*\u25c9 Worldbuilding is something I enjoy, so if you like it too we'd probably be a good match!*\n\n*\u25c9  I prefer to RP in an organized discord server but can do email, google docs, and DMs as well (or if you happen to use RPN I\u2019m more than happy to RP there as well).*\n\n\ud835\udc73\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc8c\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc88 \ud835\udc6d\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc93...\n\nI'm really not picky when it comes to partners, as long as you put detail in your post and voice when something isn't working, we should be fine. I  do not have a posting requirement, but if you are someone that takes a  while to respond, just give me a heads up so I know you didn't ghost! If it's been a while I may give a little 'boop' to see if you are still there. If I do not hear back after a month I will remove/delete our RP.  That being said just contact me and we can try to get it going again.\n\n***Partner Specs***\n\n*\u25c9 You must be eighteen plus in order to RP with me.*\n\n*\u25c9 At least one good quality paragraph, per post.*\n\n*\u25c9 OOC Friendly*\n\n*\u25c9 Willing to plot stuff out with me.*\n\n*\u25c9 Someone that talks to me when something isn't working in the RP.*\n\n\ud835\udc6e\ud835\udc86\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc93\ud835\udc86\ud835\udc94, \ud835\udc77\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc93\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc88\ud835\udc94, \ud835\udc82\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc85 \ud835\udc77\ud835\udc8d\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc94...\n\nSince  I have too many plots and WAY too many pairings this will only be my most wanted. If you have something in mind or want to hear more plots for a certain genre just let me know. If you are interested in being partners please DM a bit about yourself and you as a partner.\n\n***Genres***\n\n*\u25c9  Fantasy:*\n\n*High Fantasy - Dark Fantasy - Urban Fantasy*\n\n*\u25c9  Historical/Period Piece:*\n\n*Middle Ages* *-* *Western - Victorian - 60s, 70s, 80s*\n\n*\u25c9  Science Fiction:*\n\n*Cyberpunk - Dystopian/Utopian - Space Opera - Planetary Romance - Post-apocalyptic*\n\n***Pairings***\n\n*\u25c9  Royalty*\n\n*Royal x Handmaiden/Servent*\n\n*Royal x Guard/Knight*\n\n*Royal x Rival Royal*\n\n*Royal x Pirate*\n\n*\u25c9  Sci-Fi*\n\n*Time Traveler x Past*\n\n*Apocalypse Survivor x Apocalypse Survivor*\n\n***Plots***\n\n*\u25c9* ***A Tale of Two Kingdoms*** *- Royalty Plot*\n\n*Muse  A is a prince. Muse B is a princess. Both royals are from neighboring kingdoms that have had a tenuous alliance for hundreds of years. Muse  A\u2019s kingdom has a formidable army; while Muse B\u2019s kingdom has plentiful gold and silks. War is threatening to come to their lands and the only thing that can secure peace for both kingdoms is a union of families by marriage of the next heirs to the throne. The prince and princess are set to be wed shortly after their first meeting, once Muse B is of age to bear children. At first, the betrothed couple do not get along. The bad blood between their fathers has tainted their views of each other long before they come to meet. Gradually, as they are forced to engage in the courting process for the sake of the kingdoms, their negative impressions of each other fall away.*\n\n*\u25c9* ***Where Is Home*** *- Space Plot*\n\n*It\u2019s the year 3015. Aerospace engineering has advanced by leaps and bounds.  In this age, the average citizen can board a luxury spacecraft and  venture out to see the sights of the solar system (A trip that would\u2019ve  taken roughly 11 years by 21st century standards now only takes 3 days  and a few hours to complete!) It\u2019s still an experimental program and tickets are quite expensive, but for those who couldn\u2019t possibly afford  the once-in-a-lifetime trip on their own, there is a lottery draw. Muse A  and Muse B have been selected through the lottery drawing this year.*\n\n*While on the second day of the tour, radio transmission is sent from Earth,  warning that a huge asteroid is headed directly for the planet; this could spell disaster for the world as Muse A and Muse B know it.  Everyone waits on pins and needles to hear the news. Just before the asteroid is set to make an impact, the spacecraft loses connection with  Earth and everyone aboard assumes the worst has happened. Though strangers before the ship left Earth, Muse A and Muse B turn to one another for comfort. As far as they\u2019re aware, everyone they\u2019ve ever  known on Earth has been lost. With no motivation to continue the trip and potentially no home planet to return to, the captain and crew must turn their efforts to finding a habitable planet to relocate to or at the very least making contact with intelligent life who might assist them before their limited resources (including oxygen) run out.\u200b*\n\n*\u25c9* ***Loyalty*** *- Crime Drama Plot*\n\n*Muse  A is a guarded private investigator, who\u2019s been hardened by years of working cases that no one else wanted. Muse A is at the end of their professional rope, exhausted by a decade of pounding the pavement to get the bad guys, while constantly looking over their shoulder. Through it all, Muse B has been their loyal companion\u2014the one they always turn to when the dam is about to break\u2014the only one that can keep Muse A from resorting to their worst vices. Muse A\u2019s latest assignment\u2014a missing person\u2019s case, involving the sibling of a childhood friend\u2014has Muse A  clutching Muse B tighter than ever. Muse B is there for all the late  nights, easily soothing Muse A\u2019s frayed nerves, but what if something comes up pointing to Muse B being involved.\u200b*\n\n*\u25c9* ***Black Ties &amp; Hidden Holsters*** *- Spy Plot*\n\n*Muse  A works in espionage, a very elite department that for all intents and purposes, does not exist. They are the very best at what they do but always work alone. Muse B functions within the same secret department,  and although they are a few years Muse A\u2019s junior, their skill set rivals that of Muse A. One particular mission comes across that seems to be tailor-made for Muse A, with one catch. In order to infiltrate an international weapons ring run by a suspected corrupt ambassador, they cannot act alone, but rather need to assume the identity of an international weapons inspector with a wavering sense of duty -  including their devoted spouse (or professional associate), Muse B. This mission will extend on for an undetermined amount of time as Muse A and  Muse B work together in the foreign country to gain the trust of the ambassador and gather the concrete proof they need to confirm suspicions. It\u2019s a never-ending whirlwind of black-tie galas and the finest cocktails, rubbing shoulders with the most influential, lies and deceit, as they gather the information required to bring the underground ring crumbling down. Purely by nature, the spies are reluctant to act as a cohesive whole, but duty demands they watch the other\u2019s back at all times and maintain the facade.*\n\n*As time goes on will they warm up to each other and come to appreciate their talent and skills or will they simply wait for the other to make a  grave mistake and leave an opening to eliminate their strongest competition? It\u2019s easy enough to make it look like an accident.\u200b*",

            "selftext": "Hey there! I hope you\u2019re all enjoying your days! Today is my day off, and I\u2019m currently looking for a new partner to do a literate romance based in an older Ninja Turtle universe after a dear partner disappeared. In terms of style, I\u2019m going for the 2012 designs, but we can definitely discuss setting, scenario and character details to fit our needs! This will involve you playing a canon character for one of my original characters. I am happy to double if needed as well, and we can have two separate roleplays going for whatever you\u2019re interested in doing in this fandom universe! I\u2019m also interested in the punk turtle designs by Sirconcon and would be open to discussing something there! This is rather vague I\u2019m aware, however I really want us to build something tailored to our wants and needs! So if you\u2019re interested in a literate, plot-driven romance with some older crime fighting turtles, you\u2019ve come to the right place! \n\nRules \n\n1. Please be a literate, 3rd person player. You do not need to write a novel, however sentence/paragraph structure are a huge must for me. No text talk or improper punctuation.\n2. Please be active overall. I understand we have lives, however, if you are the type to disappear/ghost, I am not for you. I want us to keep a steady stream going so things do not get stale! If you do need to leave, please just communicate.\n3. This will be romance and plot focused. Get ready to write something wonderful together! \n4. Because the characters are all going to be 21+ here, I am asking that you also be at least 21 years old yourself. \n5. Please be okay with MxM romantic pairings. If you request a double, I can do MxF or MxM for you. \n\nIf interested, feel free to PM me! Thank you so much for reading, and have a wonderful day!",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone.\n\nFair warning - English is not my native language so I will make mistakes. That's inevitable and I've made peace with it. If you're interested in my writing style, please check my profile - I have multiple prompts that I've posted on a different subreddit but they're enough for you to get familiar with my writing style.\n\nThe primary thing I'm looking for is a story about characters. I would like a slow and deliberate burn and exploration of the relationship that would - potentially and ideally - lead from good friendship to a romance. Settings that I would love to explore:\n\nRomance with a famous person - this would be a story about an average Joe that somehow meets and befriends someone known and powerful. It could be someone \"small\" like an Instagram model but also we could aim much bigger. I'm interested in the dynamics of such a relationship, how such a \"normal\" person would find itself in this new and interesting world.\n\nRomance with a superhero - similar to my previous point, but this time you would be playing a superhero. We could dive into the lore of the characters but it's not necessary.\n\nRomance in the time of an apocalypse - I don't have any solid details or needs about this one, but after playing Day's Gone, I got interested in the zombie apocalypse setting. I'm letting this empty on purpose in hopes that a discussion and brainstorming will bring something that we will both like :)\n\nOf course, other genres are also welcome. I love action and drama and would prefer to avoid a sci-fi. Also, we're most definitely a story in a modern setting :)\n\nI would prefer to do the roleplay via Reddit PM's but I can be persuaded to create a discord server. As for the matter of a timezone: I'm from Central Europe :)\n\nI hope that this is enough information for all of you. If there is something you would like to know, feel free to shoot me a message.",

Today I am looking for one of the two things that are completely different from each other.\n\nOne is a zombie apocalypse roleplay (The Walking Dead inspired)\n\nThe other is a normal life roleplay with a twist. I am usually not good at coming up with SOL plots but I am quite articulate and add in a lot to plots so if someone has a good plot please reach out!\n\nNSFW content is fine by me but please don't make it all about it.\n\nI roleplay in third person literate and mostly want to have fun roleplaying back and forth. If you're gonna ghost then don't reach out.\n\nI usually like a balance between a plot and 'romance' between our characters so keep that in mind when reaching out.\n\nI also like chatting oc if you're up for it as it helps in the rp.\n\nThat's it,message me if you're interested and what an interesting rp partner!",

            "selftext": "So, I've recently gotten back into playing Fallout 4. Love it a bunch, as anyone would. But spurred on by a dream I had that won't leave my mind; I would love to do an rp with Nick Valentine.\n\nI'm happy to pitch my plot idea or come up with something entirely new. Preferably a bit of romance involved but not a must. A case of some sort to give it that detective feel, and some of the ghoulies of the wastelands to give it a bit of a dramatic edge.\n\nOverall I'd just love to rp in a setting of a post apocalyptic era that is Fallout\n\nHit me up if this might be your cup of tea!",

I have a few ideas rattling around in my head ranging from alternate universes without powered to Ivy being Harley\u2019s knight in shining armor, but I want to hear from you guys too so please if your interested send me a message and we\u2019ll get to brainstorming.",

I have a couple ideas, but I'd love to Brian storm with someone.I'm open to ideas you'd like to add to anything. I love using reference photos, ooc, face claims I'm always making sure my partner is enjoying themselves. I'm always happy to add stuff if we see it first I can double or play npc.\n\n\nMost of my ideas are base around a unmarried women who became queen rather young, and just never married wanting to prove she didn't need to marry to make her kingdom prosperous.  When she meets a wealthy man or angel/demon/vampire whatever. And they start a relationship or make a bet or something.  It  doesn't have to happen super fast or anything. But there's something brewing past their initial meetings someones got secrets, and isn't being honest, there's trouble afoot...   There's some magic and mystery. I have lot of ideas I would like someone's help put it all together to make a fun roleplay world for us.\n\n\nI'm also down for something Game of thrones Inspired",

Under the moon of an eternal night, extermination is beginning to rear its ugly head, as the elements become ever more harsh, and the world succumbs to corruption and destruction.*\n\n*The world has been consumed by a horde of ravenous locusts, who answer only to the forces which drive chaos and death. Yet the brave, persistent and noble few have made their final stand for avian civilization, in a promised land known as Kalkordia. Life has flourished, and given a second chance under the protection of the Shield Mountains.*\n\n*Yet, the people within, have changed much. They've become greedy, misdirected, bloodthirsty, and have reverted back to their old, feuding ways when unity was within their talon's grasp.*\n\n*You're a Kalkordian, living under the sleepy rule of a poor kingdom, or passing through as a nomad or traveler. Your hatching was of special nature, where the fire in your veins makes you a Phoenix, legendary masters of magic. However, conflict brews within this kingdom, as the monarch inches closer to their death with dark corruption of their body, with vultures circling around his rule, oblivious to the threat from the dark magic killing him. As a phoenix, people begin to look to you for help...*\n\nHey there, this is a 1x1 RP, in a world that I've created called Divine Sky, a fantasy universe where the humanoid birdfolk built a civilization on a strange world known as Volata. You, unfortunately, are playing a birdfolk in what seems to be the end of it all, on an adventure with increasing scope and stakes, in a world built by violent cycles and cruel gods.\n\nIf you're interested, feel free to ask any questions and DM me. I've been looking for a 1x1 partner to help explore and build this world, while also telling a good story and having a fun RP at that.\n\nI write semi-lit, but if you'd like to do this lit, that's fine.\n\nMy ideas for character pairings. I like to do M/F pairings, usually as siblings or strong friends, though I'm open to other ideas.\n\n- Twin brother and sister, both carrying an omen and curse from their clan's past.\n\n- Flying knights or squires who adhere only to their code, fighting a holy war against the threat.\n\n- A mage/wizard, and their guide throughout the land, happening upon the local conflict.\n\n- Commoners taking matters into their own hands, \ndeveloping much from little.\n\n- Two individuals from different nomad bands crossing paths, and getting involved here.\n\nOr any combination or own idea you have.\n\n\nThanks!",

            "selftext": "Hey! I'm Stoneflower, an 18+ literate writer. I can write any length necessary, and prefer 3rd person. I'm looking for a long term Discord writing partner.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm willing to write either gender, with any type of pairing (m/f, f/f, m/m, m/m/f, all the other combinations). I'm comfortable with practically any topics (well, maybe not comfortable, but willing to write them).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to focus on OCs and original worlds. I am, of course, fine if you want to take elements of characters or worlds to implement in our setting, but don't take full parts (I don't want you to write as Boba Fett - but if you want to write a character who's a bounty hunter, and is inspired by Boba Fett? That's cool.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy main thing I want to do is build up a large world with you, from scratch. Any setting, any era, any themes. This world building would likely be in the form of either several plots going on (potentially with different characters) at once, that we write as we please, or several plots over our time writing together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have no definitive goal (besides writing a plausible, interesting world), and really just want to work with you to incorporate our ideas to build this up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe way I usually write is multi-paragraph replies (usually around 3-5), with occasionally shorter parts (a few sentences - particularly within dialogue), and of course sometimes some longer stuff (5+ sentences). I also love doing banter (basically just sending messages back and forth as our characters). I usually get several replies out a day (obviously depends on my mood and what I'm interested in). If I'll ever be absent, I'll be sure to let you know some time in advance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... if you're interested in doing this with me, contact me!",

            "selftext": "Howdy everyone! While normally I don't toss up an ad for this premise, it's something I'm specifically looking for at the moment.\n\n**I'm specifically looking for a GM.** I know that tends to be mean different things to people \\[As a couple months back I tossed up an ad for one, and nobody actually responded with interest being a GM, instead they assumed I wanted a 1x1 where they just design the world.\\]\n\nSo I'm specifically looking for a partner who can take that role on. That'd be you won't have a 'primary' character and would be writing for the world and most of the encounters. Kind of like being a DM for a game of DnD.\n\nThough don't worry, I'm more than happy to play a cast of characters as well, though my main focus will always be on my primary!\n\nI'm more than happy for you to have a cast of characters as well that are constantly involved, with some possibly even there the entire roleplay, though nothing is set in stone! I also don't mind the killing off of most of my characters minus my primary! Even if it's not asked in advance.\n\nLately I've gotten a couple 1x1's I'm happy with, and I'm not actively seeking another. So if you're going to message me for a 1x1 despite reading this, just know you'll be turned down. It's nothing personal, I'm just not looking for any.\n\nI would love for romance to be an option involved, in the case it is. Please note I only do MxF at the moment when it involves my primary character. Though for secondary characters and pairings I do pairings of all genders and sexualities!\n\nSo what am I looking for specifically?\n\nI'm open to a couple options! Both original world and fandom wise.\n\n**For original world**, I'm interested in all genres! From high fantasy set in a modern or medieval world, to something set in a much more cyberpunk tone! Realism or complete fantasy are both fine with me! I also historical and so much more!\n\nOf course I'm open to even more niche genres if you have any in mind!\n\nFeel free to bring any genre to the table, and I can pretty much promise you I'm game!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**For fandoms:**\n\n\\- The Witcher \\[Specifically the game's universe, not the books or show.\\]\n\n\\- The Last of Us\n\n\\- Watch Dogs \\[Preferably akin to 2 or Legion.\\]\n\n\\- Something akin to the recent Tomb Raider games. \\[More inspired than actually part of the fandom\\]\n\n\\- Star Wars\n\n\\- Resident Evil\n\n\\- Devil May Cry\n\n\\- And possibly more! I'm more than happy to hear suggestions/requests!\n\n***About me:***\n\nA bit about me! I'm just your regular dude who enjoys camping, hiking, horror movies, coffee, and several other things, but I can tell you about that later! I'm currently kicking it in the east coast of the United States, which means my timezone is EST. I'm normally free any time after 2-4 pm \\[EST\\] from Monday-Friday. And then weekends I'm pretty active as well. When it comes to post length I tend to match my partner, so whether I'm giving 10 sentences or 10 paragraphs, I'm always able! I can do novella length happily! I'm 21 and have no triggers, and am willing to delve into more mature or sensitive themes, though if something is a bit much for me, I'll let you know.\n\nI love talking OOC with partners and generally try to keep a good friendship with them if they're down for it. I won't share any info about my real life, as I've had stalkers in the past. So if I don't show you pictures of myself, or won't talk about certain aspects, please don't be offended.\n\nI actually have commissioned art for A LOT of my characters, and am more than willing to show them! I also prefer to stick to discord when it comes to a medium/platform, but I'm more than willing to discuss other options. I will not use kik/telegram. Please don't ask.\n\nThanks for reading, **if you are interested, simply DM me!**",

I'm a 20 y/o female looking for anyone 18+. I prefer to use Discord to roleplay. I'm a big fan of AU's and I'm not picky about plot lines or relationships as long as no one is underage. \n\nI've just gotten really into My Hero Academia (though I'm only partway into season three), so I was hoping to create a scenario in this universe! I'm into plenty of other anime too (mainly Hetalia and MHA) , so I'm open to whatever! Other ideas are welcome, just shoot me a message.\n\nThanks!",

They sent you to assist in a recon mission into occupied Europe, the war ended a year ago and it seemed only like a regular job, and yet something had pissed this man off. While it may seem a surprise however the doors swung open, an older well dressed man exited with no more than a petty scoff, leaving you to enter freely. There were always a lot of whispers here in Moscow, but just as many suspicious folk who would disappear into the night, you knew simply because many times you knew just where they went, it was not important how much it may or may not have weighed on you.\n\nBeing ushered by the guard into the room you were met with a particularly peculiar sight, a figure nearing 6 foot tall facing toward the window, a peaked cap showing rank as well as the coat hanging over the chair, both ranking insignias, the figure however drew more attention, even you could not deny the feminine fit physique of the General before you, but of course it was only shocking when they turned, a familiar face of the one who called for at least quite the crude nickname they gave to a woman who climbed ranks here, There was no denying it by the signature scars over her nose and lip, and of course the strange Violet eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re Late\u201d is all that was said as she seemed to stare you down \u201cI was Told you could be relied upon to be prompt and attentive in my mission\u201d\n\nThis war was rough, for all sides of course, But we were not out of the woods, Germany still stood, but perhaps in a much more unlikely fashion, they held much of the territory to the West but Russia held near all of their Eastern side, however minimal fighting done between them and instead a treaty however shaky was formed. This story follows a assisting officer (you) along with a Special unit Komandarm (me) into a shady mission throughout Ukraine, Belarus and Poland, one of which she discloses minimal information, however situations and the overall mission cause you to raise questions, especially regarding the nature of the Komandarm you are with. \\[Humanoid/Super soldier themes, I do not want to give spoilers though\\]",

            "selftext": "Hey there, everyone! After taking a long break from roleplay, I\u2019ve recently gotten the itch to get back into it.\n\nA little bit about me before we get into it: I\u2019m 21 years old, male, I love coming up with characters with my partners, and I love playing good ideas more than any specific genre or roleplay type. If you have a stellar idea for a roleplay, please suggest it!\n\nThat being said, there are certain types of stories I enjoy a lot if done right. D&amp;D-esque fantasy stories with ensemble casts and loads of worldbuilding, nostalgia heavy slice of life romances, and anything with eccentric characters and a healthy dose of comedy!\n\nAlso, I do straight and lesbian pairings, but I\u2019m not comfortable doing mxm pairings, sorry. \n\n\nRequirements + Things You Should Know:\n\n1. Must be literate. Proper grammar and spelling are essential. Nothing too fancy, we all make mistakes, just hope it\u2019s decent enough to not annoy me lol.\n\n2. Must put effort and detail into your posts. They don\u2019t have to be masterpieces of literature, but I\u2019d prefer something \u201cnovel-like\u201d and not just \u201che did this and then this\u201d. I try to put a lot of effort and detail into my posts, and would appreciate it if you did the same.\n\n3. My partner must be 18+ Preferably in your 20\u2019s, as someone who\u2019s 21 it can be awkward if my partner\u2019s  too young or way older than I am. \n\n4. Must be willing to match what I write or at least 2-4 decently sized paragraphs.\n\n5. Everybody gets busy, I definitely do, but I\u2019m generally not a one post a week kind of person. I tend to get really excited about ideas, so writing about 4 paragraphs a week kind of disappoints me. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to be super prolific, but at least a couple of responses in a week would be nice. If you want, we can set up roleplay \u201csessions\u201d if you can only find a certain time in the week where you\u2019d be free to RP. \n\n6. I like and prefer character driven stories\n\n7. Not every character has to be super in depth, but I\u2019d prefer it we both played multiple characters to varying extents, depending on the roleplay. I like creating the atmosphere of a \u201clived in\u201d world, ya get me?\n\n8. I loooove collaborating, so don\u2019t be afraid to discuss plot stuff and pitch ideas OOC with me even after we start the rp, things tend to get stale if we\u2019re just winging it the entire time and are not communicating about how we want the plot to go.\n\n9. I only RP in reddit PM\u2019s, nothing else. \n\n10. Not mandatory, but an example of your writing would be extremely appreciated! It sucks planning a story out with someone, only to discover that what we both expect from our partners doesn\u2019t really match up.\n\n\nNow, for the plot;\n\n\nLately, I\u2019ve been really interested in doing a long term romance/slice of life dramatic story in which a character (male or female) is somehow transported back to 1949 with absolutely nothing to his name. We\u2019d follow his life from then through the 50\u2019s and maybe even the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s if we timeskip. Everything from there is up to us and what we come up with!\n\nWhere does he land? Who is your character and how do they meet? How did he get there? What will his life be like in this foreign era? Will this story be plot and drama heavy or more focused on the romance and slice of life elements? Will more sci fi concepts be included or explored? These and other questions can all be discussed! Also, he can be changed to be female if you\u2019d prefer a fxf romance :)\n\nAny questions or things you\u2019d like to discuss, please PM me and we can work it out! Thanks for reading!",

The survivors are forced to finish their spellcasting training by themselves and avenge their village.\n\nThat's the basic premise for the story, however I would happy to hear any improvements people have. The main storyline will be the survivors travelling to the Azura homeland, The Crimson Isles, and what they encounter along the way. This can be conflicts, new people, other villages and many other things.\n\nFor your character you will have to choose which path of magic you have chosen:\n- Elemental\n- Weapon Master\n- Summoning\n- Dark Magic (This is a dangerous path to choose, if you do choose it know that there will be some cons to using it to make up for how powerful it is)\nFor more information on any of these paths, just ask and I will give whatever answer you need.",

Thanks for taking a look at my advertisement!\n\nMy name's Kyle, I'm 20, English and I'm currently looking for some RP partners to write some cool and original stories! Before I say about what I like to roleplay, allow me to introduce myself and my likes.\n\n\u2022 I'm currently 20, so I'm looking for someone 18+. Simple enough reasoning.\n\n\u2022 I'm currently only looking for female RP Partners playing a female OC. I do apologize if this doesn't include yourself. It's just my personal preference.\n\n\u2022 I, please, ask that anyone who RPs with me is somewhat frequent. A post a day is just something that just isn't entertaining to me and my interest will quickly drop. If you're going to be too busy or otherwise occupied on some days, please tell me.\n\n\u2022 I like a partner who's detailed and experienced. Fine, quickfire posts can be shorter, but I like quality in my posts. Also, I RP in THIRD person only. Again, just my preference. I also play OC Characters only as well. I don't find it entertaining to play a Canon Character. My secret word is Delta. Please use this in your message at some point so I know you're reading all of my post.\n\n\u2022 Finally, I like people who are interested in the same things as myself. Please understand what my RP is being based on.\n\nRight! Now I have my expectations out of the way, here are the things I'm looking for to RP!\n\n\\--\n\nThis RP is going to take major inspiration from the Disney+ Show, The Mandalorian. Expect this time, it's going to be set within the Destiny Universe.   \nI\u2019m currently looking for someone to play a new and upcoming Guardian within the ranks of the Vanguard, out on a mission to find a Guardian long since forgotten about. The Jackal, Anubis. Ikora knows him as Kyle. This man is considered Osiris\u2019 left hand, with Ikora being his right, and has been missing from the city since a personal tragedy rocked his world. Ikora has intel on his whereabouts but is struggling to pinpoint a location, so tasks you with doing so. Ikora needs her friend back. The Red War has left a heavy toll on the city and the rise of other dark forces and powers requires Ikora to have all hands on deck and to do so, she needs her Brother-In-Arms back. Find him, Guardian. Bring him home.",

            "selftext": " Hey everybody! So, I have this OC that I really want to use in a DC roleplay, and I have a general idea of an AU I\u2019d like to see them in. We can work on specifics of the world and plot together, though! I want this to be a collaborative process. The AU is a darker AU, and my OC deals with some heavy stuff, so definitely 18+ please!!  \nA little info on myself, first. I\u2019m Stevie, I\u2019m 19, agender and use they/them pronouns. My time zone is EST. I love to make friends OOC, but can also cool it with the table talk if you want lmao. I\u2019ve been roleplaying for about 4 years now. I usually do third person, OCxOC, semi-lit to lit roleplays. I tend to be really active, since this is my daily escape of sorts, but let\u2019s discuss what kind of availability you\u2019ve got because real life always comes first. My characters tend to be a part of the LGBT community, since that\u2019s an important part of my own life! Lastly, I have two cats and I *will* talk about them and send pictures, sorry about it.\n\nI\u2019ll give a little information on my OC here and then you can PM me for more information! I roleplay over discord, so we\u2019ll probably discuss more details there! I can expand on my character (I have several short stories about their life written, a three hour playlist, and several drawings I\u2019ve done. Sue me, they\u2019ve existed since I was fifteen.) and the AU there as well!\n\n(tw mental health things, a neglectful parent)\n\nWes Todd (they/them) is the only child of Jason Todd, and the oldest of the Bat Family\u2019s grandchildren. They\u2019ve grown up with the pressure and expectation that they would one day be the next Robin so, when Bruce passes them over it really shatters them. Jason also isn\u2019t a great dad, he prefers flirting with Roy Harper and being a vigilante to trying to raise a kid so Wes is usually on their own. Sometimes, Richard Grayson can step in and be a kind of parent to Wes, but they often have disagreements and that falls apart. Wes is fiercely independent, would rather goof off than discuss genuine feelings, but they\u2019re highly empathetic. They also struggle with mental illness and that can get kind of intense, just as a warning.  \nI have so much more I could say about them, and some of the headcanons I have about the Bat Family around them, but if you\u2019re interested in that little blurb let\u2019s start there lol. Hit me up and we can discuss more stuff!! I love to rant about Wes and also really love to hear people rant back about their own! Let me know if any of this sounds interesting to you!",

            "selftext": "With the recent clearing up of my schedule, I've had more time in general, both for scrolling listlessly through reddit for hours and actually being a productive human being. So, I decided to hopefully fill some of that time by getting back into roleplaying! I'm 20, with roughly 5 years of roleplay experience in the 3rd person, and I live on the West Coast, so you might be getting some late-night replies depending on where you live. In terms of expectations, I'd just like someone who's literate and can respond at least once a day, with enough creativity to match my writing length(about 2 paragraphs average) and make their responses read interesting. I have some ideas of my own, but feel free to bring anything you want to the table, as long as it's a little original.\n\n**Idea 1: Low Fantasy Heist**\n\nThis is one I've been wanting to do for a while now, but never really got to play through. In a feudal-Asia-style low fantasy world with DnD races and all that, a thief sneaks into a noble's home with the intention of gurgling some jewelry or other valuables. But when the noble's bodyguard notices them, things start to get dicey.\n\n**Idea 2: High Fantasy Aftermath**\n\nAfter a nondescript war between two nations in this high fantasy world, two representatives from said nations are sent to live together in a neutral city in order to work out a peace treaty without the influence of either power. Over the course of trying to come to agreeable terms, the two diplomats find themselves agreeable on other things, and romance starts to blossom, even if to the detriment of the countries' peace negotiations.\n\n**Idea 3: A Wild Goose Chase**\n\nIn a world where superheroes exist, as two police detectives on the city gang's payroll, our characters are assigned to tracking down a certain vigilante who always seems to be one step ahead. But one of us is the vigilante, and is highly motivated to lead the other down the wrong path, or to at least convince them not to rat them out.\n\n**Idea 4: Your Choice!**\n\nI might have basic starting points ready, but I want to know your ideas for scenarios too, and depending on what you have, we could create something great! I'm not very familiar with fandoms, but if I recognize one I know, I'll try to keep an open mind.\n\nI prefer to use Reddit or Discord for these kinds of things, so we can either stay in pm's, or take it to a private discord server. And not all of these plots require romance or NSFW, but we can work them in at our whim. All in all, I'm just looking for a relaxed, literate story I can help further everyday.

            "selftext": "Howdy Gang! My name is Nathan, 22 years of age, and currently a senior at college. I\u2019m currently in eastern time, but by the end of November I\u2019ll be in Central for Thanksgiving/Christmas.  That being said, I have a little bit of experience roleplaying (on and off for the last couple of years). I consider myself semi-literate, with the ability to match my partner's post length. I would like to lean on the more detailed side however.\n\nThat being said, here are some ideas I think would be interesting:\n\n1. Conservatory Students: This is based on the anime \u201cYour Lie in April\u201d (Probably my favorite anime of all time). It wouldn\u2019t be a direct copy of the story, but the premise is the same: 2 Young musicians in love, and their adventures/blossoming romance. I would love classical music to be the main focus, but since I know it isn\u2019t the most popular genre anymore, I can shape it to rock, jazz, pop ect. Really anything but EDM and country.\n2. Metal Gear-Esque: Like the last one, not a copy and paste of the MGS series of games, but in that style. Something like 2 agents must work together to complete a secret mission. Main focus would be on the action/adventure aspect, but I wouldn\u2019t mind a romance plot as well.\n3. Athletes From Rival Schools: Somewhat clich\u00e9. Late high school/College students from rival schools that play the same sport, or something similar (Soccer, Volleyball, Tennis, Football/Cheerleader, etc.). They meet at a game or something similar, and romance grows, despite the rivalry being there.\n4. Phoenix Wright/Danganronpa: This is a harder one, that involves a lot of world building. If you know the premise of each game, you probably know what I\u2019m looking for: A case that builds and unfolds. The focus would be on the investigative aspect, but romance could be there. \n5. Greek Mythology: Nothing specific with this one. Either make our own myth, or play out another. I was inspired for this one from all the Smite I used to play back in the day. As much as I loved the mechanics, I also loved learning the mythos/lore. I also loved the Percy Jackson series growing up, so maybe something like that as well, whether it be a camp half-blood type rp or not. \n\nFandoms/Other Video Games/Genres\n\n* Naruto\n* Fairy Tail\n* RWBY\n* Fire Force\n* Halo\n* Assassins Creed\n* Western\n* Historical\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEveryone and All characters in these roleplays have to be 18+. Also, if you want something similar to an OOC regardless of where we RP, I'm always welcome to it! If you are interested in any of these RP's shoot me a pm. Have a good day!",

Just lost my job, so I have a good bit of free time while I hunt for a new one! I don't have any particular ideas, right now. If you do, I\u2019d love to hear them! I love a good fantasy setting, historical setting, sci-fi, but I'm open to collaborating. Having a craving for something dark, maybe with werewolves, demons, dragons, or magic. If that\u2019s not your cup of tea, please still message me! \n\nI\u2019m just usually NOT into Slice of Life, modern settings, or Fandoms.\n\nA little about me. I'm 27 (so please be around my age. I can't be doing this with an 18 year old, sorry, be at least my age?) I've been role-playing on and off since I was about 14, so this isn't anything new. I currently have one role play partner on discord, which I've been writing with since the beginning. The stories are always fun, but they're not testing my writing abilities anymore. I'm on EST, and do work full-time, but I am working from home, so I can sneak replies during the day. Reply length doesn't really matter to me, the longer the better, of course, but it's quality over quantity. I don't really have any limits when it comes to quantity. I typically play female character, but I'm open to playing both, and am willing to play multiple characters as needed.\n\nAs I said, I don't have any specific ideas in mind, I'd love to hear anything! I can also come up with an idea, if you have none and I like our vibe. Oh! Also, I don't want this to be just business. I'd like to also make a new friend, and occasionally have conversations outside the story. If that's cool with you?\n\nWell, I think that's everything! If you're still here, and are still interested, please shoot me a message, maybe start off with a joke! I look forward to meeting you!",

            "selftext": "Hello! I'm a fairly experienced collaborative writer; or, well, I was before a long break from storytelling! I'm hoping to find someone to write with to chase a couple of lighthearted prompts I have rattling around in my head as of late. Just some quick housekeeping, though, before I detail those ideas: I'm in my twenties, and I'd like my writing partner to be as well. I really try not to write any characters with established canons or universes, since I feel like it's easy to get stuck trying to capture a particular protagonist's mannerisms and style. It's more fun for me to explore characters original to our own story, and I hope you agree! My responses tend to be a couple of paragraphs long, at minimum, and I'm primarily looking to write through Reddit messages, although I'm willing to hear out other options as well. Now that the boring, terms-of-agreement stuff is out of the way, here are the prompts I have!   \n\n\n1. **The amateur superhero and the roguish supervillainess** \n\n  \nWhat if a small college town featured both an upstart superhero making headlines in the local newspaper and a supervillainess looking to make mischief and sew silliness, but the two of them unknowingly shared several classes together? That's the gist behind this idea! My character is a comics-loving college student who, with the help of a fashion design major who's sworn to secrecy, fashions himself a superhero suit when he hears about the antics of a supervillainess. He won't have any powers, relying instead on guile and athleticism and a nifty array of gadgets. What he doesn't know, though, is that your character, a supervillainess (who can certainly have any powers you think would make the narrative more fun!) who has her eyes set on infamy and glory, is a classmate of his. This prompt is more slice-of-life than your typical superhero story: There can and will be scenes of action, to be sure, but I'd like to focus on character interactions, when they're in their super-suits and when they're not! And, inevitably, what ensues when their secret identities become less than secret.\n\n  \n2. **The humbug and the holiday-hearted heroine**\n\n  \nMy character is a college freshman who moves to some snowy northeast locale (possibly New York or somewhere in New England would make the most sense) from his native California. The early part of his first semester is over, and so too is the weather he feels more comfortable in: What's left of fall's warmth has faded to wintry cold, and the first December flakes are already starting to fall on campus. Of course, missing the endless summer of the West Coast, where he could still be surfing well into January, he finds himself burying himself in his studies and reluctantly sporting a winter coat as he trudges from lecture hall to lecture hall, unamused by the cheery lights strung between the lampposts near the library, or the decorated spruce tree in the student union. I thought it'd be fun if you'd like to play one of his classmates who cherishes the holiday season, and does her best to pull my character into a seasonal sense of joy and wonder. And it would be even more fun if our characters have a kind of lively rivalry: Maybe your character lives in the dorm next door, and, say, sleuths out his Bluetooth speaker code and wakes him up for their earliest class with a steady stream of Christmas songs. Fun, festive pranks like that to help make their holiday season bright!   \n\n\nFeel free to send a message if either of these prompts feels like something you'd enjoy; and, if you do, please include an idea for the character you'd like to play! Good luck in your writing endeavors, whether these are the stories for you or not.",

            "selftext": "Let\u2019s get to business!\n\nI\u2019m looking for new roleplays. Specifically fandom roleplays but if the idea is interesting enough I will do an oc x oc roleplay but I am picky. \n\nI\u2019ll start with my fandom ideas. I\u2019m looking for something potentially transformers or venom/carnage or just symbiote based. I would appreciate it if you can play canon as I am a canon x oc roleplayer. I don\u2019t mind playing canon on the side or multiple characters but I do not play canon full time. \n\nAny other fandoms I have consist of: hellboy, blue exorcist, seven deadly sins. I have another but alas, banned topic. \n\nOc based roleplays are a bit more tricky. I\u2019m a stickler for fantasy- specifically dragons. Come at me with a dragon plot you\u2019ll have a higher chance of getting me interested, even if it\u2019s \u2018weird\u2019. I\u2019m not huge on action or post apocalyptic and I prefer to come up with plots with my partner. \n\nNow if you\u2019ve gotten this far you\u2019re either interested or bored which I commend you to. Now let\u2019s get into the rules and such\n\nI am advanced literate! Please be somewhere similar. All I ask is 5 plus lines and to type cohesive sentences. It\u2019s all good being able to type 5+ paragraphs but if they\u2019re a garble of poor English and grammar then it\u2019s not exactly worth it. Same the other way around. It\u2019s one thing to type a handful of lines but what\u2019s the use of putting a lot of detail in to 2 or 3 lines. It seems counterproductive \n\nLimits wise. I can cope with most things. Furry? Cool- send me pictures of your fursona ooc unless were using them in the rp. Into some messed up things? Dear god give me a warning first. \n\nFinally- I have troubles in my personal life medically. Sometimes I am unable to reply to posts for a day or 2 at a time. If that\u2019s an issue let me know so I can warn you in advance if I feel as if I\u2019m going to hit one of those points. I\u2019ll appreciate any and all ooc talk as long as it doesn\u2019t overshadow the roleplay. \n\nThank you if you\u2019ve gotten this far! I hope to hear from you all soon.",

Something about learning about what makes countries and lands tick, and how people can exploit it, is just fascinating to me!m\n\nI prefer fantasy settings for this kind of plot, the real world is confusing enough, and I want to worldbuild! Sci fi would also work, but fantasy is my go to genre. \n\nI like playing as the head of state of a country, or the heir to it, but I can do anything! I really don\u2019t have a preference, so if you have an idea, just tell me!\n\nMessage if interested! Thanks!",

I\u2019m a 21+ literate writer looking for a couple of partners. I have around 12 years of roleplaying experience and consider myself a decent writer. I am happy to provide samples. \n\nAs far as genres, I\u2019m craving something in the horror-vein (some cool gothic-type stuff, maybe sci-fi horror) but am open to most other things. I\u2019m not incredibly picky, but am uninterested in slice-of-life. \n\nAs far as partnership goes: I am always happy to chat OOC. I put significant emphasis on mutual collaboration and communication. At base, a good roleplay is built from a foundation of open dialogue and honesty. \n\nIf you think we\u2019ll be compatible, send me a message! I look forward to hearing from you!",

Guess 99 percent friends here never heard this platform, lmao\ud83d\ude02 I also knew this app from my friends and joined the platform when it was under Beta stage!\n\nJust met bugs every day. Hahhaha don't know when..it's my daily fun to report suggestions and bugs to the team. Yeahhh, a lot of kind user volunteers like me from different countries are helping this new baby app to grow bigger cause it's really an amazing app!! We are having a lot fun here. It's kind of like our spirit home \ud83e\udd70\n\nThis app just released its official version with amazing updates like chatroom roleplay support, name card, voice bio... Still have plenty of functions that need to be perfected compared to Amino, Discord... But it's strange that we like it so much. Maybe because we have devoted our love since joined or the people here are so nice and active))",

            "selftext": "The title hero is often overused. People that take on trials for their own personal gain use it, as a way of sweeping their intentions under a thin cover. Others, use it as a title to be revered, and looked up to. Many heroes aren't the genuine article. Most of the time, they are just people, looking to set themselves aside from others.\n\nTrue heroes are often very rare, and very short lived. Well, most of them, at the very least. The primal mages of the Arcanum coast...well, they're a bit of an enigma. You could ask almost anyone in the kingdom about them, and you'd probably get a smattering of theories of what they are. Some will say primal mage is just a title, taken up by the next person in the line, others will say they're immortals, slumbering away until they're needed again. But out of all the theories, one bit of information is constant. The mage of storms was a coward, and abandoned his companions when they needed him the most.\n\nMost people sneer when that title is brought up. Even more so when people have the gall to utter \u201cStorm Raven\u201d, rather than boil it down to a simpler, more insulting title (although that was about as far as anyone could take it). What he did to earn that vilification wasn't exactly known, either. Most just left it with what they knew. Probably because it was the easier of the alternatives to accept.\n\nMost people wouldn't dare digging into his past. It would only be met with nasty looks and various other unsavory things. A few people were crazy enough to try and hunt down what happened, though.\n\nWho knew? Maybe someone would find the elusive \u201cStorm Raven\u201d slumbering, in some unmarked shrine, waiting for his companions to wake him up once more.\n\n)(\n\nAnd with that brief introduction, allow me to start this off with a brief explanation. This is, obviously, a fantasy rp, set in the country of Arcanum, aptly named because of all the magical happenings that fill the land. I'm planning on making this a rather expansive world, with plenty of lore and mysteries sprinkled in (if the above starter wasn't any indication). \n\nWith that, some ground rules. I'm looking for an 18+ partner, that can keep up with posts around 2-5 paragraphs. I am planning on some romance being included, hence the 18+ requirement. Other than that, some action and drama as well, along with three dimensional characters, all that jazz.\n\nI'm awful at these closing notes bits, so honestly, if I've caught your interest, shoot me a PM. Please add some detail in your introduction, **I can't stress this enough.** We can definitely work something out. Before I leave, though, I'll ask that if you do message me, put the word stormcloud in your message- it helps me know you read the entire prompt.",

Some of the shows I'm into are Walking Dead, Dragon Ball Z, Sopranos, Gotham, Smallville, Wentworth, and Lost. Some movies - DC, Marvel ( Pre MCU like Sam Raimi's Spider-Man, X-Men, Hulk), horror ( Slasher - Freddy, Leatherface, Jason, Michael, Ghostface). However, I'm not opposed to doing something completely original that has nothing to do with fandoms either. Never really done an original story but I have played as original characters in some of the shows listed in this post\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf Interested then feel free to PM me. Thank you in advance",

            "selftext": "I know this request is a little cheesy and clich\u00e9, but I have found that it's actually a really cool roleplay idea. My idea for the plot can go two major ways, and there's so many other scenarios to go about this! One thing for sure I'll make clear is that this is a modern roleplay, I don't want this to be set in a past time. This is more of a fantasy/romance/slice of life? My OC has been turned against her will, and is now forcibly living the lifestyle of a vampire. This could go about many ways, maybe Vampire/Vampire Hunter, Vampire/Normie, etc. She is college age, got turned at 20. \n\nSo. Some things I'd like about/from my partner. I prefer a male roleplay partner but it is not required by any means. Please, please communicate with me and please be active. I've been having a lot of partners ghost me lately on really good roleplays and its such a huge bummer. With that said, I don't want our roleplay to feel like a chore, but don't tell me you're going to reply and then don't answer me for weeks. That's really upsetting. \n\nAs far as me, I am in the EST zone. It helps to have a partner in the same zone or near it but again, not required. I'm a huge night owl so I'm sure it can work out somehow. I write in 3rd person, I'm not a novella writer but I do respond with at least a paragraph, I'm working on trying to be more descriptive. I play games often too but please do not let that deter you from roleplaying. I respond rather quickly regardless of what game I may be playing at the time. If I am working,, i can respond periodically but I am more active after 8pm EST. Please let me know if you are interested!",

If you persist, I'll ignore your message.\n\n\nHello, you can call me Doe!  I'm in my 20s, a small business owner, and a proud cat mom. I write  multiple paragraphs/novella style (200-500+  words). I love to write detailed descriptions and delve into a character\u2019s head/emotions as well as  surroundings. I compare it to   writing a novel together.\n\nI  understand if the scene doesn\u2019t have alot going on and therefore requires less like rapid fire. I adore having long, thoughtful replies where we truly immerse ourselves in the world. I'm hoping to find a  partner whose as enthusiastic and passionate about the plot and writing as I am. When I get invested in a story, it\u2019s 100% dedication. Getting  a reply is the highlight of my day.\n\nI'm a big fan of romance and using face claims. I\u2019m the type to make  pinterest boards, spam you with gifs, headcanons, and send you songs that remind me of our characters and/or ship. I'll get excited if we  come up with future plot ideas, or if our characters are being cute or angsty and I can yell about it in the chat.\n\nLast but not least I only do MxF (with *myself* in the female role) and don\u2019t double, but I\u2019m more than happy to write side characters of either gender to help move the story along. \n\nDesperately Searching For\n\n* 21+ partners\n* For you to have an excellent grasp of grammar, punctuation, spelling, and  capitalization. Both in character and out of character. (Literate to  advanced writers only, please. I'm not looking for newbies).\n* The more description, the better! I'm looking for someone who can write as  much as me (2 to 4 paragraphs or more) and really bring the story to  life. I lose interest if I'm the only one that's invested/enthusiastic  or coming up with plot ideas. Quality writing makes my heart happy, as  does world building together.\n* Joining me in the wonderful world of ship/character development is kind of a must. I feel discouraged/feel like I'm the only one invested if I get nothing in return for say, coming up with some cute headcanons.\n* While I'd prefer real life face claims, I'd also be open to using realistic art if you're uncomfortable with real life. I draw the line at  anime/cartoon-y art.\n\n(Since I've gotten some messages about it, I'd like to say I have zero interest in slice of life or historical plots)\n\nOriginal Genres:\n\n* Crime\n* Post Apocalyptic/Dystopia\n* Supernatural/Modern Fantasy\n* Southern/Mid-Western/Urban Gothic\n* Sci-fi\n* Superpowers/Gifted\n\nFandoms: (I don't write canons)\n\n**Star Wars**, X Files, Haven, Fringe, Stranger Things, Heroes, The Wolf Among Us, **Mercy Thompson Series**, True Blood, Marvel, The OA, Disney (personified), His Dark Materials, Beastars, Horizon Zero Dawn, The Last of Us\n\nAll my characters will be adults and I require my partners to do the same,  as there will be adult themes in my writing. For more plot and genre  ideas, message me ^^ I can write over email or discord, and if we click I'd be happy to give out that info.\n\nPlease be detailed when you message me, let me know why you chose to contact me. Seeing only \"hey do you wanna rp?\" is a guaranteed way to turn me off.\n\nLook forward to hearing from you!",

I need at least a post a day, but usually prefer to be on together in a back-and-forth conversation. Therefore please carefully consider my time zone before contacting!\n\n**Original idea:** \n\nMy character is a male demon, who makes a Faustian deal with your character to grant them one wish. The only problem is that the wish goes wrong, and leaves your character growing up bitter and resentful of this demon. Years later, he comes to collect their soul and they end up dragged along with him as he goes about his demon business... The demon is snarky, charismatic, selfish and unapologetic... but maybe he's got a soft side somewhere deep... deep... DEEP down?\n\nThis is an action plot but with some comedy elements of enemies/opposites being thrown together. I'm open to a slow-burn M/F romance here too, or just enemies to friends. Please be prepared to help plot and come up with fun new scenarios. I have an overarching idea but I don't want to be doing all the heavy lifting.\n\n**Fandom:**\n\nMarvel/MCU: I'd like to play Bucky Barnes against Steve Rogers.\n\nI have a number of ideas - just ask!\n\nIf you anything sounds interesting, please private message me. **Don't use Reddit chat,** I won't see it.

            "selftext": "Hello, I'm a very experienced roleplayer, been in the roleplay world for several years. I'm seeking for new partners to play out stories and ideas, got one or two in mind myself, but I won't state the details publicly because of the dark themes I tend to dive into.\n\nI'm a literate roleplayer and I can guarantee decent post length (not less than one thick, complete paragraph up to three, four five... depending on what you give me and depending on what part of the story we are working on!), good grammar (although English is just my second language) and very frequent posts (at least once a day, at the moment.) I can play both male and female roles, but I'm currently willing to play a female character. I tend to include side characters in my stories, just to make the whole thing more interesting. Please, if you are going to write with me, make sure to be able to handle one main character and at least one side character as well and at the same time, and have nothing against pre-made characters as I do have one male character to offer, which is kind of ready although we still need to discuss some details together. This why I'm normally very picky, my bad.\n\nI'm obviously willing to plot together and I can come up with ideas, so feel free to message me on here or ask for my Discord/Kik username if you are vaguely intrigued.\n\nThank you!",

            "selftext": "Hey,\n\n\nI am back here looking for literate partners whom I could roleplay with. I have two plots that I wish to roleplay with but I am completely open to listening in to your suggestions on my plots, your own ideas and anything you want to try.\n\n\nYou might have seen similar plots and the reason why I am posting from a new account is that I forgot the password to my old account and decided to start again!\u00a0\n\n\nI am 22 years old and will not roleplay with minors. Also, I am okay with a few NSFW elements in the plot and we can further discuss that when you reach out to me.\n\n\nAs for the Original Plots that I want to share- I have a few. They are extremely different from one another but there is a lot that can be done with the plot. I will also mention the fandoms I am in so that we can come up with fandom based plots for the roleplay as well.\u00a0\n\n\n______________________________________\n\nMy Plots:\n\n\n\nPlot 1: Opposites Attract.\n\n\nNate the character that you will play is a little narcissistic and superficial. He's tall, popular and has a temper issue.He is sculpted by God. He has been in a long relationship with Maddi, who is very bipolar and toxic. But he is no less. He used to think that Maddy was it for him.\u00a0\n\n\nHe didn't have tattoos neither does he rebel by Breaking rules. He has the perfect grades and the perfect everything yet people fear him for once you're not on his good side, it's terrible to be on his bad side.\n\n\nEnter Belle. She is the polar opposite of Nate. She only knows Nate because of sharing a few classes with him but doesn't get in his way at all. She loves baking, cooking and dancing. She is bubbly. But there is one thing that she hides. She had been falling for Nate and everything he went to Maddy, he'd break her heart. She pretends to not react much to it by over indulging herself in other things and activities.\n\n\nBut when Nate gets to know of Belle's little crush, he starts pining for Belle and they have a small fling which is nothing official. He keeps going back to Maddy and that complicates the relationship between Belle and Nate.\n\n\nARRANGED MARRIAGE PLOT:\n\n\nThe world was on the brink of destruction and humanity had vanished from the phase of the planet. Fertility rates were at an all time low and life expectancy had gone down by three times. All the destruction and chaos cause by the Great War had its toll on the few survivors.\n\n\nBelle was one of them. She was just 23 years old and missed her life before the war, the bombings and the mass murders. She was the daughter of an affluent minister who had somehow paved his way through contacts and money to keep his family alive. But things had changed now.\n\n\nShe was expected to be married off to the modern day commander. These lines of commanders were responsible for the restructuring of the planet that they once lived on. They were known to be extremely loyal to the government and were cold hearted men- that's what a war does to men.\u00a0\n\n\nBelle was married off to Steve, one such commander. He was higher in ranks compared to his colleagues. He was in his early 30s and was barely the person he was before the war took place. Belle was expected to marry him, hold his reputation up in the dystopian society\u00a0 to make a family with him and to take care of him.\u00a0\n\n\nTITANIC PLOT:\n\n\nMy plot is a bit different than the movie and you'll soon get to know why. As for me- I am an experienced rolepayer and I am literate too. I have been doing this since a year and have learnt a lot about the art of roleplaying!\n\n\nEnough about me- as for the plot, it involved my character- Belle and yours- Steve. Both of them come from rich families. The most elite families in New York. Belle is naive, bubbly and a hopeless romantic while Steve is staunch, stern and a womanizer. They have been arranged to marry so that their families can form a strong alliance in New York. Steve is complaining against the idea of marriage. He prefers being in the company of the woman he's having an affair with while Belle is excited to try her best to find love. Will she\u00a0 be able to keep up with Steve and make him love her as well or would she end up in a loveless Marriage? Most importantly, would they survive the biggest obstacle that they are going to face aboard the titanic?\n\n\nThe dynamic between members of both families, the tone set and the uneventful incident sinking of the titanic have always piqued interest in me.\n\n_______________________________________________\n\n\nThese are some detailed plots that I would LOVE to play with anyone who is up for it. I love slow burn romances, unrequited love, drama and the likes of all that is very extra haha.\n\n\nI am obviously open to any suggestions or even creating a new plot with you! I hope to get some responses and I look forward to talking to you soon. xxx",
