Why? Known by few. Many think of him as insane, as they should. For as all living beings know, there are consequences to killing a God\u2026\u201d*\n\nThey call them World Walkers. People who can travel between worlds and learn their secrets. They are employed by many in power to bring messages, assassinate, and gain knowledge.  There are few who are born with the power and even fewer were knowledgeable enough to wield it. Antosha Melikov is one of those people. The story of his path is broken across the worlds he crosses, no one knows the full truth of it. All they know is he\u2019s after a certain group of powerful people, and he\u2019s done nothing but use his time to gain power.  \n\nIn this RP, your character and Antosha will be walking the path of vengeance. Vengeance on a God. It\u2019s up to you to figure out why you would walk it with him. Do you wish for revenge on the God's heralds? On the God himself? Are you there for the money? The opportunity for power? The glory? Another reaper tasked with the same goal? Nothing else to do? Whatever it is I look forward to seeing what you come up with! You\u2019ll be able to create any kind oc character you can imagine. After all you can come from a different world. So you could be a modern human, alien, medieval fantasy person, sci-fi, literally the possibilities are endless. I just ask if you do come from a world other than modern Earth you come up with ideas of what the world your character came from is like! I very much love worldbuilding with folks.  \n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Hello! You can call me Pygmy. I\u2019m 18 years old with six years of roleplay experience. I like to write in third person and I\u2019m a literate writer. Expect a few posts a week, but if I won\u2019t be around I\u2019ll be sure to let you know! If interested please DM me and we can talk about setting up everything and your character, though don\u2019t tell everything! I like to learn about characters through the roleplay. Without further ado, Here are some of my rules.\n\n1. Please be 18 or older. There will be some dark scenes, and some NSFW content woven into the roleplay.\n2. Expect some comedic writing! I love adding lighthearted and upbeat writing to make things more fun.\n3. Expect two paragraphs or more in a post. Please try to keep one liners to a minimum and I will do the same. However I don\u2019t mind shorter posts if you or I are having a hard time with writing at the moment! So don\u2019t force yourself to type. Also please have a grasp on grammar. If there\u2019s a few misspelled words don\u2019t worry about it, but please be legible.\n4. Feel free to chat with me about inputs! Though know in advance not everything can be added in. If you have any questions about the world let me know! I'm still developing it, so the more interesting things I can add the better! More worldbuilding will be revealed through the RP..\n5. I'd prefer to have at least one response a week, though if something is happening I understand. Just please let me know if you are no longer enjoying the roleplay!\n6. Don\u2019t be afraid to have conversations OOC! I love talking with people and having conversations about whatever. And if I don\u2019t respond for a while please don\u2019t hesitate to message me.\n7. I\u2019m only on discord.\n8. Don't be surprised if you have to play multiple characters from time to time.",

I'm searching for a male partner to create and roleplay together a story based on a great civilization in this world: The Nordics, or popularly known, the great Vikings.\n\nThe plot can be based on any time of the Vikings' ancestry, but I would like to include several factors that were part of the routine of this population, such as culture, customs, beliefs, the raids, and the organization as a society. \n\nI wanted to create a plot based on the vision of our characters, but also to explore what happens outside their daily lives. I would very much like to have a romance between them, but the story does not have a specific genre: genres mix, romance mixes drama and action, like a good book is written.\n\nThe main story can be based on real historical events, using historical figures, but it can also be built by our own creativity, with new characters and events.  \n\nI am looking for a partner who has literary experience, who likes and knows how to build stories and narrate events, who can narrate several characters besides the main ones, and who has a good knowledge about Vikings, so that the story becomes more rich in details, and thus becomes more and more real and pleasant to explore.\n\nInformations about me:\n-My timezone is GMT-3.\n-My routine is not very busy, so I have a lot of free time.\n-I have experience as a writer, but English isn't my first language, so sometimes my writing may have some errors, which will be corrected.\n- For this plot, I prefer to write in third person. \n\nIf you are really interest in being my partner and creat this new world together, feel free to message me with a presentation about you.",

But when the town decides that they can no longer tolerate the witch, whose side will [y/c] be on?\n\nI want the romance in this to be slowburn and natural. I also want it to be FxF. I might give MxF a shot, though.\n\nThis one is most likely going to be dark. Just let me know what your triggers are so that I don\u2019t accidentally overstep.\n\nThis is going to have religious tones. I\u2019d really prefer for you to be open minded to other religions, especially paganism. If you cannot be, then please move on.\n\nOnto the nitty gritty.\n\nSpecifications: I\u2019m semilit. I write one-three paragraphs, and I usually hit three in my starters. I write in first person, but can write in third person if need be.\n\nExpectations: I\u2019m looking for someone who can write at least two lines. As long as you try to match, I\u2019m fine.

It broke your heart and I acted terribly. \n\n10 years later, you're engaged with a boring but rich man. He provides for you and there's a big wedding to plan.\n\nI've been travelling the world as a medic. I got better qualifications and had a very early marriage with a fellow medic. Several years on, we're divorced and I've come back to my hometown. I'm bigger, hairier, more muscular, a lot more confidence.\n\nI don't intend to seek you out or date you but if we meet, I'm going to apologise. Explain that I was young and stupid. I'm a father now and I understand life a little better. \n\nWe bump into each other and after the meeting you reconsider your life with the rich guy. The lack of passion, the boring country club, the same package tour holidays.\n\nI'm currently living in a mobile home by the beach while my new home is ready. I'll be working as a doctor in the clinic. Just to cover maternity for the last doctor. But it gives me a small period of stability, a time to save and maybe a ladder to a bigger thing. Or I can travel again. It's just I've no partner in crime. \n\nThe thing is: I loved the family life but my ex wife wasn't the one. The travel I love but I want it to be with someone I love. Then maybe I can settle down. Start another family. House in the suburbs. Boring contentment. We'll meet and I'll get you to call off the engagement very quickly. You can't get married when you're pregnant with any man's baby",

I usually use discord as we can create a server and keep things organised.   \n\n\nI am looking for someone who has their own ideas and likes to make complex, realistic characters who  have dreams and flaws. I am open to ideas on the exact content of the RP. Finding the right person is more important to me right now than the precise storyline. I enjoy slice of life, fantasy and more.   \n\n\nI like to write decent length responses. Not all responses have to be several paragraphs eg. with dialogue but I want someone literate and able to write good length responses as seems appropriate. I am looking for someone 18+ as I enjoy having a romantic angle to RP at times.   \n\n\nIf this is of interest to you then please get in touch! I would love to hear your ideas.",

            "selftext": " I\u2019m back at it again!\n\nSo I thought of this really cool idea for a Slice of Life Roleplay. I want to build a town, a living and breathing town. It can be anywhere in the world but I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s a small town where everybody knows each other and everybody who lives there had been living there most of their lives. Everybody\u2019s intertwined somehow and they all live rich and detailed lives. Everybody had secrets, triumphs, and failures. \n\nThis will be a 1x1 roleplay where we play as multiple characters. Now we won\u2019t play everyone all at the same time because that would be convoluted and impossible but we each have a few main characters and then a bunch of side characters. These characters can be any gender identity and any sexual orientation. We can have any pairing in the book, FxF, MxM and MxF. Every pairing that we have can have their own time in the spotlight as well. I\u2019m thinking that we can also do events like a town wide Christmas party or Thanksgiving party. \n\nI think this could be a really fun idea and a great way to get out some creative juices. I would prefer this either be over Google Docs or Discord. Maybe Discord more for the organization that it has. I want this to be longterm, something that grows with us as we mature and grow. \n\nI\u2019m thinking we can start with our two main characters just moving into this town and take it from there. So they have to get to know everybody and such. \n\nSome Rules:\n\n\\~ Be 18+ This will contain mature themes  \n \\~ Be literate enough to at least write one paragraph   \n \\~ Be able to post once a day  \n \\~ Love OOC chatting as much as I do!\n\nIf this interests you at all please message me!",

I can write quite a bit when I\u2019m feeling inspired and while I don\u2019t expect you to match, I do expect you to put your best foot forward though, as will I!\n\n\u2799 Your grammar and spelling don\u2019t have to be perfect. This goes hand in hand with the rule above - just try your best and I\u2019ll be happy. \\^\\^\n\n\u2799 Please write in the third person, 1st person is hard for me to immerse myself in. Past or present tense is fine with me, but I usually stick with past tense!\n\n\u2799 Be LGBTQ+ Friendly. I might ask to pair my OC up with someone of the same gender so if you prefer to only do FxM that's completely fine and I can choose my OC to fit that accordingly - but please tell me beforehand! Otherwise, I'm m//, f//, and enby friendly.\n\n\u2799 Real-life comes first, take breaks when you need to, don't feel pressured to respond every day, and take your time. Roleplay is a hobby, not a job! Plus, I have... lots n' lots of patience. If you disappear for months, I guarantee if you come back and ask to start up again I'd likely say yes.\n\nHowever, do please keep me updated! Even if it's a simple 'I'm doing okay' I'd like to know that everything is alright! While we're on that topic, please talk to me OOC as well! I love headcanons and rambling about the roleplay as we write. Plus, who doesn't love making new friends?\n\n\u2799 I\u2019m willing to play any canon character for you in return for you writing one for me, I might stumble at first, but I will try my best. Please be willing to do the same. It\u2019s okay if you\u2019re not perfect, I\u2019m not expecting you to be, but be willing to leave your comfort zone! On that note, if we share the same interest, I\u2019m okay with splitting, doing an AU on my end, or switching (depending on the fandom)!\n\n\u2799 I only roleplay on Discord or through email.\n\n\u2799 I am ghost friendly, no hard feelings! I don't try to ghost anyone unless I'm very uncomfortable, but I understand when people need/want to just dip out without a goodbye. Goodbyes can be awkward!\n\n\u2799 Romance is cool, fun, and funky fresh (that\u2019s the whole point of doubling lol) but I want a plot too! Please, throw me your plot ideas, AUs, and whatever else! Mystery, drama, action, adventure, horror, angst, throw everything you have at me - I would love to plot with you!! That being said, communication is key, please give me more input than 'sounds good/okay/im fine with that'!\n\nthat\u2019s it - i\u2019m really not that picky! i like to think i\u2019m very open to most things people can throw at me, but as long as you can follow those basic guidelines, please message me!! i don\u2019t bite! C: and of course, as above, so below - all of these rules apply to me just as much as they do to you.\n\n\ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc2c - \ud835\udc22 \ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc32 \ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1e, \ud835\udc22 \ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27'\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc28 \ud835\udc28\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc31\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc1c \ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2b \ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc31\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \uff65 \uff61\uff9f\u2606: \\*.\u263d .\\* :\u2606\uff9f. \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\n**\u21dd Jojo's Bizarre Adventure**\n\nI am caught up with the manga / anime but prefer if we stick to roleplaying in the anime parts. Would make an exception for SBR, though.

Im into a lot of different plots so don\u2019t be afraid to give me some ideas! \n\nI enjoy Slice of Life role play the most and like being as descriptive as I can be. Im into a lot of different plots since theres so many we can do in SoL. My favorite plots would be:\nApocalyptic \nHigh School\nSmall town\nCollege\n\nThose are just a few of the role plays I like and enjoy! I am open to hearing new ideas and we can hopefully talk and come to an agreement on a role play. So don\u2019t be afraid to send me a PM so we can chat and figure out scenarios!! I also prefer discord since its the easiest for me to use and I don\u2019t really like Reddit chat but we can always work something out!\n\nPlease do not DM if you are under the age of 18! Please! I don\u2019t mind NSFW role play also. I expect it to happen at some point if we are role playing together but we can do clean also I really don\u2019t mind! \n\nI like being literate and descriptive, I like the role play to be good and enjoyable for both parties. I don\u2019t want to rush into NSFW instead I prefer a good build up cause I think that makes it more enjoyable.\n\nAnyways! Thanks for reading my post! If you are interested please send me a PM and don\u2019t be afraid to bounce new ideas around! Im in it for the long term so don\u2019t be afraid to give suggestions!!",

I tried. Barely found anyone older than 18 y.o, let alone someone writing more than a few sentences, that's probably not a place to look for literate older players that I can find here around the subReddits \ud83e\udd17\nSo I have no idea where to look then, maybe I can reach someone this way. Once it worked so why not try again? \n\nBut hey, Reddit is a big big world, and maybe I believe in coincidences so I'll leave this post here, in any case, just hit me up.\nWhy Russian?

            "selftext": "Hi all! Sadly, this subreddit temporarily closed the moment I joined and now months later I noticed it is up and running again so I am really eager to try advertising. If you can put up with my wordy and confusing way of posting an RP ad, maybe you'd like to write with me!\n\nA little bit about me: I am a 21 year old writer and I love roleplaying as a way to share creative ideas with others while improving upon how I already write. This means I am not a super demanding partner. As long as you are communicating your writing to the best of your ability, I'm not going to force you to type more or less or change how you roleplay. I'm always interested in trying different ways of writing and roleplaying!\n\nOne negative aspect  (or maybe this could be a positive depending on how you look at it) of roleplaying with me is that I am not so good at preparing fully fleshed ideas before talking to someone and therefore I don't really ever have a specific prompt to work with. I think it's much more efficient to talk about possibilities until we both agree on what we want to write about. However, I do have a couple key preferences that might help you decide if I am someone you want to RP with:\n\n1. I pretty much only do FxF roleplays. This means that I prefer roleplaying as a female main character and I usually prefer my partner to do the same. This is literally nothing against male roleplayers or male characters, it's just a personal preference I have that makes me comfortable for various reasons. FxF can be an aspect of romance if you prefer but it is essentially just a character preference for me. Also, this doesn't mean I am against playing male characters all together and it doesn't mean I'm against male characters being in our RP. FxF is just referring to our main character choices and if you are a male who also likes to write female characters, I would be totally fine with that!\n2. Style and mood is everything to me. I like lots of different plots and stories but a consistent tone is what usually drives me to write. When I say I like consistency, all I mean is that I think it is better when we are both aiming for the same thing. If we are going for a cute and fluffy RP, I don't really wish for it to take a sudden depressing grimdark tone. Vice versa as well: When dealing with serious subject, I don't really wish to infantilize the topic in a way that makes it feel silly. With all that being said though, I think really good roleplaying comes when we reach a point where we can naturally balance different aspects appropriately, without a really abrupt tonal shift every single time.\n3. I am inspired by anime, manga, and other types of animation when it comes to roleplaying and not so much real life subject matter. This does NOT mean our RP has to be based off of an anime or existing series, just that my ideas are usually drawn from that sort of fiction and you'll notice I don't like to do face claims or involve my real life at all. I also find it easier to compare what we like about existing series so feel free to bring up things that you enjoy when planning a roleplay with me!\n\nI'll name a few things I personally like as well to illustrate what I'm best at writing.   \nI really love magical girls, just about any fun plot involving girls using magic or getting powers is always exciting for me.  \nI like lots of different seinen content that usually involve serious subject. They can be a lot more dramatic and action-focused than the other stuff I RP but they can also be psychological or experimental.  \nThrillers are good too, anything with an element of suspense and mystique.  \nI also like awkward, slowburn, realistic romance. Not just two characters getting together but all the authentic stuff that comes with actually getting to know someone.  \nLOVE horror but more specifically I am interested in the paranormal and mythos from different cultures.  \nThen sometimes I'm fine with doing unapologetically cute, fluffy, and laid back roleplays to relax.\n\nThe stuff I wrote down may or may not paint a clear picture of what sort of roleplaying I like to do but keep in mind that this is just what I can say for sure about what I like to do, everything else is up for discussion and I definitely encourage people to share their own ideas and interests with me if they are curious enough. I pretty much always respond positively.\n\nRegardless of what we end up writing together, send me a message here on reddit to get the conversation started! My ideal medium for roleplaying is Discord and gmail so attach those to your message if you'd like. Hope to hear from some of you!",

They\u2019ve just moved to this small town and they\u2019re trying to live their lives. Maybe they\u2019re going to college and are freshman? Maybe they\u2019re in their 30\u2019s and needed a fresh start in life? Whatever the case may be, I\u2019d love to be able to write out their lives from start to finish. I want them to fall in love, get married, get divorced and then remarried or maybe they live a happy fulfilling life on their own. Whatever it is, I want them to do it!\n\nI\u2019d like to do this over Discord since it\u2019s easier to keep track of things. I\u2019ll make a server and we\u2019ll have a channel for characters, side characters, and roleplay. I love keeping things organized!\n\nThere are a few rules that I have, just to make sure we\u2019re on the same page:\n\n&gt;Be 18+ This will contain mature themes  \nBe literate enough to at least write one paragraph  \nBe able to post once a day  \nLove OOC chatting as much as I do!\n\nIf this interests you at all please message me!",

I'd like to explore the unprofessional side of things, what they do off the job, family/friend interactions, anything that involves them keeping their \"profession\" on the down low and doesn't necessarily involve lock, load, fire, on endless repeat\n\nAs far as characters go, I have some ideas that would allow for some interesting character dynamics. If these aren't of your liking, I am flexible and open to new ideas. Some ideas are:\n\nOperative x Trainee\nOperative x Operative (Coworker dynamic)\nOperative x Missed Target\nOperative x Spouse\nSpouse x Spouse (Ala Mr. and Mrs. Smith)\nOperative x Police Officer (Forbidden romance possibility)\n\nI'm leaving roles open as far what or who we are, as I'm a little more interested in character interaction and their relationship. I am able to provide more in depth to the ideas above and can even provide the Operative's code. Also, OOC  interaction is encouraged as I think it would help if we could coordinate/complement each other's thoughts in the RP.\n\nMy only requests as a writer to another is that you are over 18, and that we avoid one worded answers.",

I am up late due to work and I\u2019m an early riser. I roleplay mostly male but I\u2019ll do just about any side character we add into the roleplay. I love to do a range of role plays from Slice of Life, to mysteries, westerns, or fantasy Fandoms (star wars, just about any anime, Harry Potter, etc.) with any OC or characters from the books or movies or shows. I love to add a ton of drama and twists to them. If you want to roleplay message me! I am free most of the time and look forward to creating something wonderful! Can\u2019t wait to meet you! I have a couple ideas in mind they\u2019re mostly slice of life\u2019s but I\u2019m open to anything. These aren\u2019t set in stone they are open for change. \n\nSports Star x wife/girlfriend \n\nMarvel/DC crossover- this is a weird random idea I\u2019ve been wanting to do for a while. \n\nSpace Adventure/odyssey- something to do. With long travels a whole universe we can create together. \n\nVampire x human- kinda cliche and overdone but I kinda want to play the human since I\u2019m always the vampire lol\n\nI am currently looking for a Star Wars roleplay involving OCs!! If you have an idea or want to create one together please let me know!",

The Dragon's Phantom is also intangible, but able to interact with the physical world around it through unknown means. Reports state that it's somewhere around 60-70 meters long. It doesn't seem to have any special abilities to control it's surroundings, but it's still very dangerous, due to it's size and immense strength. \n\nIt might be intangible, but a field test stated that it's possible to wound it with our latest weaponry. And of course you'll be equipped with our latest armor to protect you. Do you copy, Soldier?\"\n\nHe says with a stern expression on his face.

I have a few ideas, and I would love to hear yours as well! \n\nif you're interested, here are some things you may need to know:\n\n* I'm in a CST timezone.\n* range of Semi- Literate. to Literate, with a preference to write in 3rd person, but can do 1st.\n* I can match my partner in length. I would like both of us to write at least one paragraph...no one-liners, please.\n* I would love to world build around the Ocs with you! \n* 18+, please. I do not mind any mature aspects in the roleplay, but it should not control the whole plotline. **With that in mind, the Ocs should be over 18.** \n* My main way of communication is discord.\n* I'll talk to you ooc a lot to get a feel on how you are doing and generally bounce ideas. \n* slow typer but I will try my best to give quality to make up for the time lost. ( usually, I overthink what to say and then finally type it out five-ten minutes later. I'm working on increasing my WPM as well.)\n\nEither way, thank you for reading! I hope you enjoy the rest of your day/night! if you have any questions or interested, slide into the DMS. The door is open.",

            "selftext": "Medieval fantasy is usually written with the \"heros\" as the main focus, but I'll be honest, it's getting old. I want to try a story where the bad guys are the main characters; the ones who eventually get what they want. Whether their intent is simply to see the world burn, or something with more nuance, I'd really like to explore this idea.\n\nI'll say first that I want a partner who's decently literate and capable of writing two paragraphs (or more) per response. Single paragraph responses are okay in moderation, but overall detail is important.  I'll mention also that I'm a slow typer, my replies can take a while (up to 30min) to write sometimes, depending on post length and complexity.\n\nWhen it comes to formulating ideas, I like to do so with my partner. If you don't care about giving input and come off as apathetic, I will lose interest quickly. Please come with some creative character or story ideas, I have plenty to share myself. Reference images are a huge bonus, I mean this in regards to characters, important locations, items that are difficult to describe. I'm a very visual person, and although this isn't required, I do appreciate it.\n\nIf this interests anyone, feel free to PM me for my contacts. Thanks.",

I\u2019d prefer my partner be over 20 years old.\n\n-I can rp both genders, but I usually have my main character be a female.  I generally only do hetero pairings.\n\n-I typically write anywhere from 3-5 paragraphs. I\u2019d ask my partner do their best to match.\n\n-I can typically get a couple of responses in a day, and i\u2019d ask that my partner does the same.  \n\n-I\u2019d like plot to be the central aspect, with a romance subplot aswell! We can discuss this further once we get to talking.\n\n-If I ever cannot respond for some reason, I\u2019ll do my best to give you a days notice! I\u2019d ask the same, but obviously there are some things that you can predict.\n\n\n\n\nShanghai, China.  After years of financial crisis and political conflicts, the city becomes overrun and ransacked, making one of the West\u2019s only eastern connection in turmoil.  In response, the US hires multiple private military companies in order to get the city back into US hands.  This story will follow two characters who are sent into the conflict.\n\nSo, hi.  After that little vague prompt, you might be wondering exactly [how] interesting a boring political conflict could be fun to write about.  My answer? Stupid amounts of worldbuilding and some fun scenarios.  Our characters, under these circumstances, would need to choose between their own ideals and the ones of their superiors, all along the way digging themselves deeper into a conflict they truly have no connection with.  I want to include themes of espionage and action, along with quieter, more character-driven moments. Plus, with the freedom of military-like topics without the restrictions of writing about such.\n\n\nLemme know if you\u2019re interested THROUGH A MESSAGE. Thanks!",

I figure I should tell you all a little bit about myself? I'm 23 and tend to write between 2-3 paragraphs per post; Nevertheless, write more than that depending upon what's going on in the roleplay itself. I struggle with punctuation and such but always try to make sure that my posts are decipherable and clear to understand.\n\nI can do both first and third-person, so let me know what works best for you! I mostly roleplay over discord since it's just easier to keep organized (it also allows me to check messages out on my phone too.) As for face-claims; I like to use reference photos of real people, anime, and cartoon pictures make me cringe.\n\nI like my partners to be around the same age as me; this is just for my comfort. It's just much more comfortable for me to write with someone roughly my age, especially in a romantic slice of life roleplay. As for the roleplay itself, I do have some ideas; however, I would much rather go through them with you in person! If you're interested, then please send me a message, and we can discuss the ideas there!",

            "selftext": "Hey everybody! Thanks for taking the time to pop in and see if my idea is of interest. First off, to give you an idea of me and my writing style, I\u2019ve been roleplaying for a number of years. I recently took a pretty long hiatus, but have come back as of about a month ago. My writing style would be lit-advanced lit. I write more novella style, third person, with posts ranging anywhere from a few sentences to 10 paragraphs, depending on the situation. Obviously more dialogue or action heavy bits will require a bit less than a wall of text. \n\nAs for my idea, I can only claim partial credit for the inspiration. My original partner disappeared before we even got the RP off the ground, so I\u2019d ready love to see if someone likes what we came up with and wants to run with it with me. The idea is that an angel, having lived since before time itself, has grown tired of angelic life. She has watched mankind from the clouds and found humans to be quite curious. Her curiosity grows to strong desire to understand them, and eventually to *be* one of them. In her moment of weakness, Lucifer comes to her and offers her a deal: Give up your angelic wings, fall to the earth, and I will grant you the ability to live as the humans do. He promises her she will love as the humans do, be excited over things humans are, and will be able to experience all that is good. At any time she can simply will herself back to heaven, her curiosity satisfied. \n\nShe agrees to the deal and finds herself in the American colonies right at the cusp of the American Revolution. For the first time ever, she understands what it feels like to have the sun on her skin, the grass beneath her feet, and...the icy grip of fear of the unknown. As time goes on, she learns that Lucifer did not lie when he told her she could live as the humans do. However, he didn\u2019t tell her about all of the awful things mankind suffers from, be it naturally or at the hand of another person. Even worse, she eventually learns that she is, in fact, still immortal and is unable to return to her cloud and harp. Stuck on this planet, she must navigate new found emotions and experiences while also trying to find her place in a land both unified and plagued by turmoil. \n\nThe way this is playing out in my mind is for us to have our own primary characters with you the angel and myself an OC. We would then have a sort of pool of characters that we can introduce and utilize as each of us see fit. This would add a level of depth and richness to the story and also give a uniqueness to each side character as they are built by us both rather than just one person. An example could be my character\u2019s father. In my character outline, he is very influential in her life, but is not a key character in the overarching story, so therefore would be awkward for only one person to utilize. As for content, I want this to be as dark as it is light hearted and inspiring. I am not afraid of any topics or subject matter.\n\nIf this sounds of interest I\u2019d love to hear from you! I have a heavy preference to roleplay with only females, so please respect the tag. Sorry, gents. While I have roleplayed via other channels, discord is my strong preference for this. If you\u2019re interested in doing this, please be communicative, engaged, and creative. While I have this outline, I want to tweak it with you and make this story ours, not just mine! Please send those orange envelopes my way!",

I am currently looking for someone to do a Percy Jackson roleplay with me. I have a preference for mxf pairings but I can write as either gender. Usually, I find that doubling is the easiest way to make things fair, but it is not necessary.\n\nAll I ask is that you can write at least one paragraph, have decent grammer, and are able to contribute to the plot. Character-wise I would prefer if we used our own original characters and not canon characters. I have a discord, so we can either roleplay on there or on here.

Well then I\u2019m a Semi-Lit roleplayer who is really into roleplaying anything. I can do certain video game, or certain movie universes, or do a full on completely unique universe that me and a partner can make up. I normally enjoy romance Roleplays but I can also do action, saddening, adventure, or really just anything. As long as it can excite both me and you I\u2019m sure it will be amazing. I guess just some basic rolaplay rules I suppose?\n1. I mostly only play females and rarely if ever Roleplay Males. I can roleplay a male but I feel way more comfortable with females. This doesn\u2019t effect who I like to roleplay with at all, and I certainly don\u2019t mind who or what you are. \n2. I normally dislike people who only like to troll or make fun of our roleplay world we can create so if you only really want to troll and do stuff like that please don\u2019t roleplay with me. Although I still widh you best of luck on your journeys.\nAnd I think that\u2019s most of the basic rules I have. If you want to pm me or something just to chill, talk, hang out, and roleplay then I\u2019d love that! I\u2019m always open and mostly always free so hope to see you soon. Also I really hope this is how you\u2019re supposed to make one of these things because Yeah I\u2019ve never made one of these before",

I\u2019m an 18+, 3rd person writer in the EST timezone and I\u2019m here to bring some good old holiday cheer.\n\nI\u2019ve recently started binging this show on Netflix, called Dash and Lily. It\u2019s so cute, and with the holiday season approaching, I\u2019d love to do something based off of it. As it\u2019s based off a romcom, there\u2019s totally going to be some cheesy fun, but isn\u2019t that the whole point of roleplay? Escapism?\n\nThe plot is simple: A notebook, we can decide how it looks, is found by one of our characters at a bookstore. In the notebook, there\u2019s three words \u201cDo you dare, if so, turn the page.\u201d\n\nThere, is a challenge, we can decide what it says, and once the challenge is completed, leave the notebook at the bookstore. In this notebook, these two are going to share an adventure around the city, sharing secrets and getting to know each other. We can even write the notebook itself, using a google slideshow!\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in writing a cute holiday romance, send me a message with the thing you love most about rom coms.\n\nif you dare.",

Thanks for checking my post out.\n\nI\u2019m looking for a partner who is female or willing to play as a female to create a story directly based off of the Fruits Basket anime with me. This roleplay will revolve around romance and drama.\n\nI wish to play as my OC, who is a member of the zodiac. Whether she is an add-on animal or will replace someone both of us think won\u2019t be important to our story can be discussed. She will be part of the Sohma family. I will give you her specific details in PMs!\n\nI *prefer* to play with another OC who is outside of the family, but if you want to play as one of the canon girls, I won\u2019t stop you. \n\n*General info about me and my writing:*\n\nMy name is G and I\u2019m a 20 year old female, so I\u2019d like anyone who is interested in writing with me to be 18+! \n\nMy writing style is literate and third person. My replies usually range anywhere from 2 to 8 full paragraphs depending on my partner\u2019s length and what is happening in the RP.\n\nMy reply speed is typically 2-3 times a day. No worries if yours is less or more. I am patient!\n\nThis is a common question I get - my timezone is EST. \n\nI prefer to write on discord!\n\nFor this RP, I don\u2019t see any NSFW content being included.\n\nI think that\u2019s about it for now!\nIf you\u2019re interested, send me a DM with some info about you, the character you wish to play, and any ideas you might have. Thanks again!",

There\u2019s multiple avenues we can take this, you could be the avatar? Another member of a nation? A non bender? I have a bunch of ideas for plots depending on what your character is!  A regular avatar becoming a the hero the world needs plot, or something else! I got a bunch in the vault!  For some reference in each plot the earth nation has grown into a more oppressive force, much like Kuvira was trying to do during Korra but more successful and menacing, with less giant mechs. I\u2019ll elaborate upon chatting with you more but there\u2019s plenty of detail!\n\n\nWhat I need from you is your character! And please, make them interesting, nothing\u2019s worse than rping with shadowy edgelord who doesn\u2019t talk to anybody, only trains and wants to kill all who oppose them.  \n\nSend me these things please!\n\nCharacter name\n\nAge: \n\nBending element, Specify here weather they\u2019re the avatar of if they\u2019re a non bender.\n\nPersonality and backstory summary!\n\nAppearance if you want to add that, a reference or a description works fine!\n\n\nI rp on discord, easiest to do detailed rp there.\nI normally post at least two paragraphs, so please be able to somewhat match that!\n\nHope to see you soon!",

            "selftext": "To all that need a bit of Christmas Spirit this holiday season,\n\nOh, hi there! My name\u2019s Flynn. I\u2019m an 18+, 3rd person writer in the EST timezone and I\u2019m here to bring some good old holiday cheer.\n\nI\u2019ve recently started binging this show on Netflix, called Dash and Lily. It\u2019s so cute, and with the holiday season approaching, I\u2019d love to do something based off of it. As it\u2019s based off a romcom, there\u2019s totally going to be some cheesy fun, but isn\u2019t that the whole point of roleplay? Escapism?\n\nThe plot is simple: A notebook, we can decide how it looks, is found by one of our characters at a bookstore. In the notebook, there\u2019s three words \u201cDo you dare, if so, turn the page.\u201d\n\nThere, is a challenge, we can decide what it says, and once the challenge is completed, leave the notebook at the bookstore. In this notebook, these two are going to share an adventure around the city, sharing secrets and getting to know each other. We can even write the notebook itself, using a google slideshow!\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in writing a cute holiday romance, send me a message with the thing you love most about rom coms.\n\nif you dare.",

All genders, sexual orientation, ethnicities are welcome! \n\nI am in my thirties and I have been writing for quite some time... several years of experience under my belt. I do tend to write multi-paragraph and even in novella format quite frequently, so please do not send a message if you do not think that you could meet that expectation \u2014 also in third person writing, exclusively.

Today I\u2019m currently looking for a new partner to do a literate romance based in an older Ninja Turtle universe after a dear partner disappeared. In terms of style, I\u2019m going for the 2012 designs, but we can definitely discuss setting, scenario and character details to fit our needs! This will involve you playing a canon character for one of my original characters. I am happy to double if needed as well, and we can have two separate roleplays going for whatever you\u2019re interested in doing in this fandom universe! I\u2019m also interested in the punk turtle designs by Sirconcon and would be open to discussing something there! This is rather vague I\u2019m aware, however I really want us to build something tailored to our wants and needs! So if you\u2019re interested in a literate, plot-driven romance with some older crime fighting turtles, you\u2019ve come to the right place! \n\nRules \n\n1. Please be a literate, 3rd person player. You do not need to write a novel, however sentence/paragraph structure are a huge must for me. No text talk or improper punctuation.\n2. Please be active overall. I understand we have lives, however, if you are the type to disappear/ghost, I am not for you. I want us to keep a steady stream going so things do not get stale! If you do need to leave, please just communicate.\n3. This will be romance and plot focused. Get ready to write something wonderful together! \n4. Because the characters are all going to be 21+ here, I am asking that you also be at least 21 years old yourself. \n5. Please be okay with MxM romantic pairings. If you request a double, I can do MxF or MxM for you. \n\nIf interested, feel free to PM me! Thank you so much for reading, and have a wonderful day!",

            "selftext": "Hello there roleplaying friends and those yet to be. I'm here in my search of a roleplaying partner for an itch that needs some scratching! But, before we leap into that, here's a small few bits about me.\n\n* Discord. Third person, past tense.\n* 300+ word replies.\n* Active communication through the day, sharing music/memes.\n* I enjoy writing realistic characters with realistic problems, goals and motives. \n\nWith that said, here's what I'm craving. It's two things, but I only want one. It's either a roleplay based around surviving S.T.A.L.K.E.R.'s Zone, or something chill and mellow like The Red Strings Club or VA-11 HALL-A.\n\nIn other words!\n\nIn one hand, you have a gritty, dreary, bleak and depressing Eastern European wasteland where everything and anything wants to murder you and take the last two pieces of stale bread that you have on you. This would best (in my opinion) be explored with characters who conflict just enough to at least slightly dislike one another, but have a common goal/motive in mind that keeps them going. Maybe they want to go to the Wish Granter and wish that the Zone ceases to exist. Maybe they want to expand the Zone. Maybe they want to do a million different things, but instead of rambling in a post that most probably won't even read, I say it's best we cross this bridge when we get to it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the other, you have a dystopian cyberpunk world that leaves so much open and allows us to craft a lovely, slowly progressing story that we can go through together, with many different characters that are unique in their own ways, slowly building up the world as we go along through dialogue and character interactions. Slowly piecing lore together through conversations and such. Ideally? I'd like this mostly-contained in a bar type area at the start. We'd build onto it as we go. I could even get creative enough and decide to make a neat little map in Photoshop for the city that we'd explore. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nConclusion:\n\nI want something more character-oriented and for the long term. I want to keep it realistic (as realistic as the settings respectively allow) and I want somebody to write with.\n\nI'm in Europe if timezones are a bother to you, but I am **not** one for back-and-forths because they tire me out quickly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for your time.",

The games pretty fun overall. I really like a couple of the female characters so I\u2019ve been interested in rping with proper who are willing to play them. Note I\u2019m still pretty early into the game and most likely only half way through the story but I\u2019ll try my best to know what\u2019s going on. \n\nThe ones I\u2019m interested in rping with are \n\nLisa\nMona\nMatured piamon \nKeqing \nBeidou \nAmber \nJean \nNoelle \n\nI\u2019ll most likely be playing the traveler or one of my ocs if that\u2019s no problem with you. \n\nI don\u2019t have many plots for this but we can talk about it in dms. \n\nOne is \n\nA traveler goes into Mondstadt to get some weapons made from the blacksmith for his village. It\u2019s only slightly off the map so he had to ride on a wagon. Once he gets there he wonders around the city. \nIf you choose Lisa he\u2019ll manage to wonder into the library but if it\u2019s someone like ember she could probably bump into him or just go up to him to chat for any reason you\u2019d like. \n\nI use discord , amino , and Reddit for rping so. \nIf your interested comment or dm me.",

            "selftext": " \n\nI am looking for a partner to the play of a young woman in a gritty sci-fi/fantasy RP. Set during a brutal civil war on the planet Mars. I consider the story more a Drama/Romance than anything else (definitely NOT millitary sci fi). I want the themes of the RP to explore things like changing human culture and political philosophy. I also imagine there be some similarities to the American Revolutionary War and a similar American 18th-19th century atmosphere. This is not strictly by design, but could well be interesting. If you came here expecting a Bowie RP you have my most sincere of apologies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut make no mistake, I'd like this to be a very human story, one of love and hate, trust and betrayal. Getting side tracked with boring made up politics would be disastrous, especially if it comes at the cost of writing good characters and relationships. To that extent, the focus will very much be on a large castof characters. My goal is to ensure every single person you could possibly talk to be fleshed out and interesting. I would like romance to occur at some point in the story, but only so long as it is slow, realistic and organic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019d like you to play a character who is initially unfamiliar with Mars and swept up into the conflict. This would allow you, as a writer, to explore the story and characters along with your own protagonist. Also please understand, this story works alot better if your character is a curious sort - question things, pursue goals, engage with the world! Dont wait for the plot to pull you along! I think a young Venusian noblewoman attending could be a very fun role. You could play her as anything between a well-mannered, albeit na\u00efve sympathiser and a spoilt brat forced to come to terms with her own place as an individual. Lots of oppertunnities for interesting arcs. There are other ideas that could be good too though and we can talk about them together in more depth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI write in third person past tense, averaging 200-400 words a reply. I don\u2019t want you to feel obligated to match my own posts but would like at least two or three paragraphs from you each response. I don\u2019t mind if you prefer first or third person in your own writing, just as long as we write in past tense, novella style. I roleplay exclusively on discord.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBelow you'll find a short intro into the setting of the roleplay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\--\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo the girl with the mousy hair\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe dirt hadn\u2019t been red in years. Centuries. No one alive had lived through how it once was. Not to say it had been forgotten. That ill-fated first generation of colonials. The now near mythic terraforming company. The dust blasted data from long dead rovers. But that place, that world, was gone. Like Selene, now a sea of shimmering neon, like Aphrodite, now a paradise of splendour and growth, the god of war had been made a home. Darkened red weakened to promising brown to taunting yellow to stoic orange. It remains an undeniably harsh place, the harshest of the lot. But there is air. There is water, if you know where to look. There is gravity. There was no need to establish a new corporate state, Luna had already been claimed as that twilight playground of capital and neon. The local Venusian Parliament had its own issues, deciding to embrace its wealth inequality rather than fight it, reverting to a classist society hauntingly similar to the aristocratic republics of old Europe. The Earth Federation dismissed the planet as the failure that it was. A necessary experiment between the Moon Habitation Project and the staggering success of Venus. There was no grand colonisation wave. No dedicated federation support. Just another office in New York dedicated to making sure the settlements paid their tithes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInstead of private corporations or Federation colony ships came the runaways. The outlaws. The left-behind and the disillusioned. The desperate and the brave. They were the true mothers and fathers of Mars. There was little external influence on that wild and untamed world. The Earth Federation cared little for the few hundreds of thousands hiding out in the landscape of searing dunes and vast canyons. Most became little more than subsistence farmers, despite the near barren nature of the soil, cultivating quiet, unassuming and harmless lives. Towns grew slowly and organically, something which hadn\u2019t happened in centuries. Land was cheap there, belonging to one or another ancient prospector company which couldn\u2019t wait to get rid of deeds bought in more optimistic days. Serious investors would normally stick off-world, keeping to orbital and deep space habitats, and where the giants stayed in their heavens, smaller native firms rose to the opportunities, regional businesses and thrifty farmers. There were always exceptions of course: some of greener areas found themselves morphing into corporate exclaves or Federation facilities. Training camps for military personal. Prisons and light industry. A few banking centres and entertainment plazas. Even prestigious boarding schools for Venusian nobles, advertising the best education across space. But on the whole, Mars was left alone. It was sleepy. It was slow. It was peaceful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo how had it come to this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMeteor storms had become a silent part of normalcy on Mars. It was easy to find places of the world unstained by the light pollution from megacities like Luna\u2019s Tranquillity and the few remaining hubs on Earth, you just had to get in a car and drive. Once upon a time people gazed at falling stars in awe. On Mars, a falling star is a shattered ship. The organs of some tattered spacecraft torn to shreds in high orbit. Rebel or Federation, it didn\u2019t matter a hundred kilometres into orbit. A falling star was an escape pod with its re-entry mechanism fried, the, hopefully already dead, inhabitants boiling into mist. They were the unretrieved shells of sons and daughters. They were the souls of the lost screaming: \u2018Look at me! Look at me!\u2019 for half seconds more as they fade invisibly into the sky.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWas it the protest of \u201985? The rising taxation? The sweet nothings of old man Mihhailov? The innocent look in the eyes of his daughter? Certainly not with the Martian Declaration of Independence. Not with the founding of the Kingdom of Cydonia, not with the signing United States of Mars Charter. Not with the repainting of the fleet, the Federation attack from Phobos, the battle of Fossae, the militia raids, the terror bombing of Old Austin, the military draft on Venus, the Lagrange 2 colony disaster, the Hannibal City massacre. All that came later. The war started earlier. Much earlier. Perhaps it had always been going on. It certainly felt like it to the weathered, Kalashnikov wielding Martian soldiers, the Venusian farm boys forced into the Federal Marine Corps, the Earth born fleet officers who gaze with bloodshot, sleepless eyes into the endless inky darkness. For those whose blood turned Mars red again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\--\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for reading. If you are interested, then please send me a writing sample through a Message and we can get to chatting (I wont respond to messages without a sample!). I hope to hear from you soon!",

I\u2019m never too fussed about how many paragraphs however. On Discord I find it easier to paragraph back and forth quickly and to delve deeper as and when needed.\n\nI like writing both canon things and alternative universe things.\n\nIt\u2019s been a while since the show has been over but lately I\u2019ve been feeling really nostalgic and would love to delve back into this world. \n\nIf any of you are familiar with this fandom and write in it please let me know below or message me your discord ID. I\u2019d really love to write with you, especially if you have an Elijah!\ud83d\ude42 I love a good ship, but love to delve deeper into character analysis as well; what makes them tick, why they behave the way they do, exploring their past selves etc.\n\nI played several others from the shows over the years and they\u2019re all female (I suck at writing guys) so if you\u2019re okay with that that\u2019s awesome too (Elena, Katherine, Camille &amp; Rebekah) \u2014 Hayley just happens to be the character I\u2019ve had the longest and studied intricately.\n\nI\u2019m 18+ so would prefer for my writing partners to be 18+ too just in case anything gets nsfw.\n\n\nLet me know!",

            "selftext": "Hi everyone! I am a male looking for a female to roleplay my famous singer plot with me. I have two scenarios for this. In the first scenario, you are a big fan of mine. In the second scenario, you dislike me but your best friend is a big fan of mine. Feel free to pm me and tell me which scenario you\u2019d like to do! I have a character already made for myself, so feel free to make one or use one you already have made. I\u2019d like to keep this strictly like real life, meaning normal humans and nothing out of the ordinary. My ideal roleplay partner would be detailed and literate, as well as giving some length in their replies. I understand that we all have lives outside of roleplaying, but responding in a decent amount of time (at least a couple times per day, if possible. If not, hopefully once per day). I also understand that after you get into a roleplay or you start it off, you may realize we aren\u2019t a good match. That\u2019s okay! Please just tell me if this happens so I\u2019m not wondering what happened. I won\u2019t be hurt by it, since not everyone is a good fit for each other. I roleplay in first person, but it\u2019s totally okay if you roleplay in third as long as you\u2019re okay with me roleplaying in first. Last but not least, I do my roleplays on Discord. If my plot and specifications interest you, please feel free to PM me! I hope to hear from you soon! :)",

In my mind their situation is a tenuous one, barely held onto as numerous crises threaten to overcome them, demanding clever decision-making and policies to save their own skin as well as those they've been charged to protect.\n\nI write at length, appreciate inventive uses of the English language and metaphor, and would appreciate a partner whom has a Discord account for the purposes of OC chatter, not for actual roleplaying.\n\nUndoubtedly there's more to go over, but that's the brass underline of it.",

            "selftext": "Hello! My name is Leo and I am an English major and a longtime roleplayer. Rp helps me out a lot with the stories I write to help me get through plot points and writer\u2019s block. Ideally I want someone who is willing to roleplay at least a few times a week to keep the stories going and contribute to the plot. My replies are usually 1-3 paragraphs depending on what\u2019s happening and I\u2019m looking for the same although I\u2019m pretty good at feeding off of what my partners want.\n\nI have 3 options for longterm roles that I want to try out here they are:\n\nOption 1: Hitman x Hitman roleplay\n\nM/c is a contract killer for the CIA. He is incredible at his job. A cold and methodical killer, he is known for taking his targets out quickly and under the nose of everyone. Y/c is also a contract killer and gets assigned an exclusive contract from her agency to test her worth. The contract comes with a profile on who M/c is and where he will be to pursue his next contract. The agency heavily suggests seduction as there is no chance in out gunning or fighting him so they think. What will become of them? Will Y/c succeed in her mission? Will M/c escape? Will he charm her? We decide! :)\n\nOption 2: Vampire Roleplay\n\nM/c and Y/c have been best friends since elementary school. Everyone thinks they\u2019ve been dating for the longest time when in reality they\u2019re scared to take the next step. They still go on friendly dates with each other and flirt but it doesn\u2019t go anywhere. Suddenly M/c becomes a vampire (lore exposed later on). After turning and falling into a world very different from his own M/c needs someone to share it with. He knows Y/c will get old one day and there is no better time to pursue her than now. After weeks of no contact at all from when he became a vampire to now he finally texts Y/c asking to go on another friendly date as they\u2019ve always have. Where has he been? When will she find out? What does being a vampire entail? All for us to decide if you chose this :)\n\nOption 3: \nCollege Roommates\n\nThe school of our OC\u2019s made an error in the roommate pairing algorithm for their freshman year of study and paired them together despite them being different genders. They are to decide after a week if they like being around each other or not. Within a week one of them discovers something on the dark web. An open contract to kill one of their professors. Is this legit? Will they do it? This roleplay doesn\u2019t need that element but it\u2019s a plot point idea.\n\nAll roleplay ideas are negotiable and if you have any of your own I am more than happy to hear them. Please please please roleplay with me :)",

            "selftext": "Hey there! Today I\u2019m looking to find some fun SCP based roleplay, I have an oc for this role who I\u2019ll expand upon more later, I\u2019d be looking for you to play an SCP, of which we can discuss!\n\nI am Semi-literate to Literate depending on how much motivation I have, I\u2019ll try and tell you whenever I\u2019m feeling a bit burned out, I\u2019m hopefully looking for someone with the same literacy however I\u2019m willing to try to adapt to match your literacy! Genre wise I\u2019m looking for Romance and Action\n\nHopefully you\u2019ll know at least some of the SCP containment breach series to help us so we don\u2019t have to stop too often to explain things; I myself don\u2019t know everything, I\u2019ve only played some of the games and read some of the wikis and videos but even then my knowledge stops there.\n\nI don\u2019t have many rules besides those which are pretty universally agreed on but if you have any feel absolutely free to tell me them so I don\u2019t cross any lines for you! \n\nWhen it comes to where to roleplay I\u2019m open to most sources, Reddit can be odd for me, sometimes I\u2019ll get notification however sometimes I won\u2019t, it\u2019s an option but it can be very 50/50, I have Discord, Kik, Amino, I\u2019m also open to downloading some apps if you have a preference.\n\nSo my Oc is named Symeon, or Subject \u03a8 (Psi) and finally his official name SCP 5112, his origins start with his mother who was a scientist, her and her colleague were making groundbreaking work however an investigation was put against them for a leak of information, it was found that the research they were doing wasn\u2019t ethical and sentenced to death, she was falsely accused however, it was her colleague who had been doing it without her consent, she was placed on death row however instead of being killed she was placed into the SCP foundation, it didn\u2019t take her long to figure out what the purpose of the foundation was, however something she hadn\u2019t told the foundation was that she was pregnant, she ended up giving birth in captivity of the foundation, during the process she passed.\n\nHe was born healthy, at first they were going to simply give him away to child protective services or put him out to foster care but during some health and safety checks they noticed something unusual, he contained some unique genetic code, he was placed in the care of Dr. Dianah Hun, a resident scientist at the facility, despite her orders they ended up forming a connection, she was his \u2018mother\u2019 and he was her son, as he grew up he began to show off the unique abilities they suspected he had, he could form mental connections with anyone or anything through touch, or if close enough just being in proximity, they deemed him useful and kept him in their care now under the name SCP 5112.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u00abPlot\u00bb\u2014\u2014\n\nIt\u2019s a day like any other, the dim and dingy halls of the facility are as bleak white as ever, the small rooms holding the D-class are as horrible as every other day, Symeon had been granted a slightly nicer room considering his position as an SCP as well as D-Class, never knowing of his own real Class as an SCP, he was met with Dinah, his adoptive mother, they spoke in person like nothing more than emotionless robots however they conversed mainly through Symeons telekinetic abilities, she told him the what he\u2019d be doing for the day, and what the purpose of the test he would be going into would be.\n\nHe usually did the same tests with a few safe SCP\u2019s to try and understand their underlying purpose or what they were, most of which didn\u2019t end up giving much more information than what they already knew, but today he was being placed with a new SCP, one he had never even heard of, he had a tendency to sneakily read through Dianahs files when she wasn\u2019t around and he was alone in her office but this one had never even come up, what confused him more was the description that she gave, it was a higher class and dangerous SCP...",

            "selftext": "Hello, all! I\u2019m looking for a single, female partner for a Warcraft-themed roleplay. This\u2019ll be a pretty extensive post and I hope it\u2019s a good representation of how I am as a writer, as well as a DM. To be clear, this RP will be DM\u2019d in a 1-on-1 scenario with heavy sandbox-elements to it. I will also require that my partner can respond multiple times per day, as I will too. I totally understand if life comes up and you can't respond, just let me know :)\n\nI\u2019ve been playing WoW since Wrath, but almost exclusively for roleplay. Since the past few years (and that disgusting expansion that\u2019s ruined any essence of fun for me), I haven\u2019t been able to find any decent writing communities within the two servers I play on. Yet, I *really* miss Warcraft, hence here I am. Before I get into prompts/scenarios, I\u2019d like to re-emphasize that this will be a DM\u2019d roleplay. It\u2019ll be like having your own Warcraft-themed tabletop RPG, except I exclude 99% of rolling and statistics. I use a \u2018Murphy\u2019s Law\u2019 system for consequences and actions. To put it simply, what can go wrong, will go wrong. I use this because it adds a small layer of difficulty to you, the protagonist, as to give the story more of a sense of accomplishment once you reach your end goals. To clarify, however, this doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ll go crazy with injuring your character or even death. I just think an aura of danger gives a lot of flavor to a story!\n\nWe can discuss the complexities of the writing later, here are some of my ideas out! Ideally, our story would take place some time during WoW\u2019s timeline. Here are some settings which interest me:\n\n* Stormwind &amp; Orgrimmar: Virtually any sort of arc could begin here. Want to be a patriotic soldier? Enlist today. Feeling like a scoundrel? Big cities always have crime guilds! Or maybe you just want to become an adventurer and explore beyond your homeland. \n* Dalaran: Once a bordering city-state of Lordaeron, Dalaran\u2019s magi council brought the city to the sky to avoid danger. Since then, * Dalaran\u2019s Kirin Tor have been a bold force against the Scourge and the Legion. (This would preferably take place during the Legion timeline)\n* Silvermoon City: Once a beautiful metropolis of the Highborne, Silvermoon was split in half and their people nearly pushed to extinction. Yet, the Sin\u2019dorei have prevailed as members of the Horde and returned their city to glory. (Could take place any time after the Scourge war)\n* Boralus: The capital city of the Kul Tirans used to be peaceful and calm, until the return of Jaina Proudmoore. Now, a vicious war has broken out on several fronts for the merchant nation. (BFA Storyline -- We can probably do it better than Blizz anyways)\n* Adventuring: Who likes cities anyways? You can set out on your own odyssey across Azeroth and see all the world has to offer. The amount of potential storylines here are endless!\n\n\nOne final thing to note: While this takes place in the Warcraft universe, this story will be almost entirely canon-abiding. We won\u2019t break lore or include lore characters (except for extremely minor appearances). \n\nIf any of this interests you, please let me know! Please let me know a bit about you and what sort of story you\u2019re looking to write :)",

I\u2019m 23 and female!\n\nPartner requirements: must be 20 to 28 years old - Must play male - write in third person - 2+ paragraphs - SFW only - must be able to post a few times a week, preferably a few times a day - good grammar and punctuation - Discord only. - Message me with your age, timezone, and a sample of your writing if you\u2019re interested! **I will NOT answer messages that just say hey, hi, hello, or ask if I\u2019m still looking.**\n\nI\u2019m also interested/have ideas in/for things such as Superheroes, witches, vampires, Vikings, and other things. Here\u2019s a whole list of roleplays I currently have plots for:\n\n**Alien x Superhero:** This is meant to be sort of Avenger-ish with aliens not being liked on Earth. I was thinking maybe your character is one of the heroes against the whole aliens being on the Earth. There\u2019s a march rumored to happen where aliens want to gain citizenship and demand the end of their races being killed. What your character doesn\u2019t know is that his beloved girlfriend is an alien (my character). She\u2019s a shapeshifter type that\u2019s been sneaking out of the house lately for meetings concerning the march. \n\n**The Selection:** Basically a slightly futuristic twist on the Bachelor/Bachelorette. One prince or princess comes of age and must go through an event called The Selection where they must find love from a specific amount of contestants. \n\n**Royal Mistake:** a prince or princess from another country comes to America for school under a disguise and fake name, and falls for a regular American commoner.. It calls for big scandals if anyone finds out who the noble in disguise really is. \n\n**Fake Fianc\u00e9e:** Y/C and his fianc\u00e9e have recently called things off. There\u2019s only one real problem to this... He was supposed to bring her to meet the family at a huge family reunion/wedding/event of your choice. He resorts to calling M/C his college best friend or his best friend\u2019s slightly younger sister, maybe they\u2019re twins, idk.\n\n**Fandoms:** we can discuss Avatar the Last Airbender, Disney Descendants, Percy Jackson, Star Wars, Harry Potter, etc. Really hoping to find someone to play Draco or a Draco like OC against my OC! I do not double, sorry. \n\n**The Contract:** two top young rising celebrities don\u2019t get along at all, for various reasons. What happens when their managers go behind their backs and set the two up on a date? Forcing them to sign a six month contract , claiming to be a couple in the public eye. \n\n**The Wolves:** Many years ago a young girl was attacked by a pack of wolves in a place where wolves aren\u2019t common. A twist on your cliche werewolf story.\n\n**The Vlog:** Nothing too crazy is planned out yet. Thinking something along the lines of vloggers/youtubers.",

I have a few prompts in mind, but am open to other ideas as well! Before I get to all that, I should cover some pertinent details.\n\n* I\u2019m in my 20s and would ask that my partner be over the age of 20 as well. I like to write fairly detailed, lengthy paragraphs and occasionally take control of multiple characters. I would ask that anyone interested be able to do the same or at least be able to keep up with that level of writing.\n* I\u2019m open to romance if it develops and isn\u2019t rushed.\n* I\u2019m generally comfortable writing complex themes and mature content such as swearing, violence, etc when a plot calls for it, but I also respect people\u2019s limits and triggers if there are any. Just let me know before we jump into a story.\n* Finally, I prefer to write in third person perspective and through Discord. Depending on my partner\u2019s preferences, I like to have tabs for FCs, location references, story notes and whatever else we feel is needed.\n\nNow, onto the ideas. Some are a little more concrete than others, but all ideas are open to modification so we can both enjoy the story and setting.\n\n**Mountain Point** - A landlocked small-ish town that sits a little less than an hour away from the nearest city. My character moves back to his hometown of Mountain Point after graduating college. While it was refreshing to be back after several years away, it\u2019s jarring to see how much has changed since leaving. Some good, others... not so much. YC could be a childhood friend, an old flame, rival, or whatever you think would be interested in writing!\n\n**College Daze** - An RP set on the campus of a college/university. I don\u2019t really have any solid ideas for this one but I was imagining it being generally light-hearted but there\u2019s still the opportunity for drama to keep things interesting and shake it up a bit.\n\n**Struggling Actors/Entertainers** - As the name states, our characters would be 20-somethings looking to try and make their dreams come true and make it big. However, that\u2019s easier said than done and they\u2019re certainly not the first people to have such dreams. They could be actors, musicians, Internet personalities etc. \n\nIf any of this interests you, get in touch!",

None can recall exactly how the end of the world, or \"shift\" came about, and few want to spare the resources to go searching as to why. Mutants born of radiation, experimentation, and means unknown wander free, the world theirs for the taking. Tribes of bandits, cannibals, criminals, and everything in between run wild. Even the terrain is dangerous and unpredictable. Acid rain, earthquakes pulling the ground apart, and lightning storms occurring within fog are a few things to be wary of. On top of all these threats are the Dreng; a collective of various types of automata whose purpose and origin is unknown, yet they use extreme prejudice coupled with highly advanced weaponry against nearly any one or thing they cross. Those who still live, either human or otherwise, dwell in heavily-defended cities both above and below ground. Not many venture beyond their own walls, and even fewer live in the wild. Those who do usually sport a prosthetic limb or two, and are armed to the teeth. Guns, makeshift swords, modified body parts, whatever they can get their hands on. Some become legendary hunters, tracking and killing unique and dangerous monsters, while others settle into courier positions to make deliveries between cities. Some of those who venture into the wild return with strange abilities or mutations, thought to be the result of prolonged exposure to the bizarre and unstable world beyond the walls. Most of these occurrences result in relatively simple abilities, such as spitting acid, incredibly thick skin, or even growing a tail, although there have been recorded instances of people sporting more powerful traits, things almost considered magic. Most who acquire these powers are disliked by the general population, considered to be tainted by the world. Still, \"pilgrims\", as they're called, are in short supply, so even mutated pilgrims are considered VIPs. And of course, there are a few individuals who set out on quests to uncover the lost history of earth, or settle a brand new city. Most of them never return, and only about forty percent of pilgrims survive past their second expedition. Welcome to Earth.\n\nHiya all, I'm Xentren, and thanks for checking out my post! I'm here looking for partners who are interested in playing around with the scene above, or some rendition of it! First off, I want to apologize if many parts seem overly vague. That was done purposefully, as I intended for my scene to be flexible and easy to manipulate depending on any ideas others would want to throw in.\n\nSecond, I am definitely open to any modifications you'd like to make, or any scenes you'd like to counter mine with! Third, thanks for reading this far! About me, I've been roleplaying for about 4 years and absolutely love it. I tend to respond with AT LEAST a paragraph for my turns, often times more if need be. I tend to match my partner's efforts, so if you give it a good go, so will I! I don't like to talk about my real life much, but I do have things I need to do outside of rp, so unfortunately I wont be able to reply 24/7, please bear with me! I'd also prefer to do longterm scenes, so please keep that in mind if you decide to reach out to me! I think that's about all I have, so of you have any questions feel free to ask me directly! Thank you!",

My name is Bee and I\u2019m a 21 year old female who is currently itching to roleplay Hades/Persephone. \n\nSo here\u2019s the thing: \n\nI\u2019m *really* into Lore Olympus, so I\u2019m really searching for someone who\u2019s into Lore Olympus as well, BUT! I\u2019m *more* than willing to write Hades/Persephone from the original Greek myths! It\u2019s just if you like Lore Olympus, that is a huge plus. \n\nThat being said, if you ARE into the comic, I enjoy more than just Hades/Persephone! I really love Persephone/Ares, Persephone/Hermes, Hecate/Artemis, Artemis/Persephone, and some other ships! I even have some OC\u2019s for the series! \n\nI also have a human au headcanon for this webtoon, and some face claims done if anyone is interested in learning about that. It\u2019s something I\u2019m really passionate about and I love a lot so I love talking about it! But I\u2019m also down to do the canon version of LO no problem. I\u2019m not really comfortable with the apollo storyline unless absolutely necessary and I\u2019d like to avoid Minthe if possible but we don\u2019t have to. \n\nI\u2019m mostly looking for 1x1, paragraph/literate style RPing. I can try and send you some writing samples! I\u2019m down to play any character but the ones mentioned above and to headcanon/bounce ideas off one another! I\u2019m hoping to make some friends out of this as well. \n\nI promise I\u2019m not picky with much. If this is something you might be interested in, shoot me a message \ud83e\udd7a I really look forward to hearing from y\u2019all! \n\nI\u2019m 21, so please be 18+!",

Just lost my job, so I have a good bit of free time while I hunt for a new one! I don't have any particular ideas, right now. If you do, I\u2019d love to hear them! I love a good fantasy setting, historical setting, sci-fi, but I'm open to collaborating. Having a craving for something dark, maybe with werewolves, demons, dragons, or magic. If that\u2019s not your cup of tea, please still message me! \n\nI\u2019m just usually NOT into Slice of Life, modern settings, or Fandoms. \n\nA little about me. I'm 27 (so please be around my age. I can't be doing this with an 18 year old, sorry, be at least my age?) I've been role-playing on and off since I was about 14, so this isn't anything new. I currently have one role play partner on discord, which I've been writing with since the beginning. The stories are always fun, but they're not testing my writing abilities anymore. I'm on EST, and do work full-time, but I am working from home, so I can sneak replies during the day. Reply length doesn't really matter to me, the longer the better, of course, but it's quality over quantity. I don't really have any limits when it comes to quantity. I typically play female character, but I'm open to playing both, and am willing to play multiple characters as needed.\n\nAs I said, I don't have any specific ideas in mind, I'd love to hear anything! I can also come up with an idea, if you have none and I like our vibe. Oh! Also, I don't want this to be just business. I'd like to also make a new friend, and occasionally have conversations outside the story. If that's cool with you?\n\nWell, I think that's everything! If you're still here, and are still interested, please shoot me a message, maybe start off with a joke! I look forward to meeting you!",

            "selftext": "Ok, I've had is concept for a while now. I want to do a roleplay in the world of Don't Starve also known as \"The Constant\".\n \nWe will be playing out the different mechanics of the game and our characters will be surviving together on the dangerous Constant. I am planning on having the different seasons in it, maybe some boss battles, and even some romance if it makes sense for the RP.\n\nI AM ONLY LOOKING FOR PEOPLE WILLING TO MAKE CUSTOM CHARACTERS, I do not enjoy people using someone else's character as their own because I think it's lazy and unimaginative. Your character can be heavily inspired by someone else's character, but you have to change it enough so it's not a total rip off.\n\nI have played the game before, and only want people who have played it and have at least a moderate understanding of the game's mechanics. I realize Don't Starve Together is a game designed to kill you in every sort of horrible way imaginable, so I will allow for things to change so it isn't as bleak as the game normally is. I am also cool wi keeping it hard to have a level of drama and fear to make it interesting.\n\nIt doesn't have to be just Don't Starve Together, we can do the original game or Don't Starve Shipwrecked, but I haven't played Hamlet so I don't have enouh understanding to roleplay there. \n\nI will only be using Discord, but I will add bots to make it interesting. I'm going to make the server with several channels to create the biomes and setpeices for the roleplay just because I like building worlds.\n\nSend me a direct message and I'll chat with you a bit before we get to e role playing. I'll be looking forward to find somebody!",

            "selftext": "BASIC \u2014 Hello there! I\u2019m currently looking for a long-term male roleplay partner. I enjoy a fandom rp that has a romance and action twist. I roleplay on Discord, we can talk a little on here and then we can exchange tags.\nWRITING STYLE \u2014 I\u2019m semi literate so please try to write at least three sentences to a paragraph! I go off detail and writing style so I prefer the other person to start, I also prefer quality over quantity so multiple paragraphs don\u2019t matter to me unless it\u2019s a starter. I write F x M and prefer to play the female. Pretty please try to write in third person. I have no triggers, so I am willing to dive into more darker and sensitive themes if you\u2019d like. I\u2019m also lighter substance friendly. I love romance and action, I also like darker and more wholesome themes too. I love romance to build overtime as I love long term roleplay!\nABOUT WRITER \u2014 I\u2019m 18 and I\u2019m a female who is currently in the EST zone. Obsessed with caramel candies and anything cosmetic. My style is a bit edgy and I love kids movies. I\u2019m a part time student in high school! I have a school break that lasts until the end of January so I\u2019m free most of the time unless I\u2019m sleeping or helping around the house.\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0fPlease don\u2019t use asterisks for the whole message, it italics the whole message!

            "selftext": "Hi everyone, I am a 19 years old guy from Europe who\u2019s currently looking for a long term role play partner that possibly won\u2019t ghost me. I have been role playing since 3+ years, I usually write in 3rd person, I write in pretty detailed and descriptive paragraphs and in order to role play I use both Discord and Kik so it\u2019s up to your own preference. Recently I have been wanting to do a slice of life/realistic or a historical role play . I already have a couple of ideas for the possible plot but I would like to discuss it with my partner anyways so that we can find out our mutual interests. This role play will include elements such as : romance, drama and nsfw moments although the story is the main thing I usually focus on. It can even include darker themes but it\u2019s up to you since I know not everyone is comfortable with those.  If some of you is interested in building this story together and if you don\u2019t mind the possible time difference just hit me up and we can definitely figure out something together. I hope you ladies will have a wonderful day. See you soon :)",

I joined in hopes of finding new and somewhat experienced roleplay partners to create new stories with. I'm looking for a roleplay partner who is at least 16 and up. I have been roleplaying since 2011/early 2012. \n\nI'm open to a LOT of ideas and I'm pretty flexible on the way things go but here are a few preferences or a few ideas on my style.\n\u2661 I LOVE romance type roleplays\n\u2661 I prefer long term. I usually really get into an rp if I decide to do it and it's no fun to have an idea of when it's going to end! \n\u2661 I like adding drama. It's like adding some spices to that already good bowl of chili. I usually dont plan out drama in the beginning, it mostly comes to me along the way and I'll throw out the idea.\n\u2661 Along with the upper bullet point, I love adding new things. I feel like without new ideas, a roleplay can become stale. Having new ideas that we both enjoy can keep it going. \n\u2661 I prefer a long story and I prefer to work through it.\n\u2661 If the roles are right, I can often come up with some kind of storyline or starter. \n\u2661 I LOVE to just figure out roles and things that we both enjoy to add into a roleplay. \n\u2661 I'm patient. Life gets busy. That's just the way things are\n\u2661 I prefer human roleplays. I've never been good with fantasy unless it's like vampire things. \n\u2661 Outline of some things I do: Modern, Past, Mafia, Romance, Couples. \n\nI am ALWAYS down for a new roleplay so just message me! I look forward to meeting new people and creating new stories! Thank you for reading!",

I'm basically looking for a partner who wants to use that era as a backdrop...just like how people use other points in history, like the 90s \nReferencing the poor technology, stupid shows and reliving the disgusting fashion trends of the Era. Think invader Zim and how families were dragged into hot topic for specifically one kid. You know the one.\n\nScenecore is basically just people who really liked emo/scene culture and i guess choose to relive it in a sense. That's what I want to do! \n\nMost popular RPs back then were definitely high school oriented with way too much melodrama in it. \nAnother one was vampires but in the exact way you would imagine it would be, edgy with a side of angst and some tears to wash it all down with. \n\nGranted i was also a child during this time so my range was...limited but I still know theres someone out there who still likes sidekicks and stupid hair. T_T I know its specific!! \n\nMy only real limits are mxm romances since I really don't like playing male characters.\n\nI only RP 3rd person because its easiest for me. UwU",

It was very very detailed, immersive, and honestly the best roleplay I had ever done. I was very emotionally invested in it and we made it work even though there was a time zone difference. Out of the blue this morning they randomly blocked me. No warning, no idea what I did wrong. I didn\u2019t even know it had happened until I noticed a longer than usual time laps in their replies and I got that gut wrenching letting box pop up saying that I had been blocked. I burst into tears. We had messaged every single day and I thought everything was fine. I don\u2019t know what to do now?? Then to make matters worse this evening Whisper apparently is not letting me post to any of my groups. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing wrong. I\u2019m not mean, gross, or vulgar. I hardly post or reply to anyone anyway. I feel so so lost. Does anyone have any advice? Has anyone been through this as well??",

            "selftext": "\n\n\nHey! I wanted to do an rp where i\u2019m the son of Clark and Lois. And you\u2019re the daughter of Bruce and an unknown mother. In this rp we\u2019re friends and possibly more than that later on. Later on in the rp i want our characters to grow up and have already made a new justice league and hopefully destroy the powerful darkside where their parents have fallen. Hopefully ya\u2019ll like my rp starter. \n\nStarter:\nI breath heavily a little scared as my father flies up into space close to the justice league space station. I held onto him tight as Clark held me smiling with a soft chuckle. He rubs my back, with that motion, i look to see Earth. It was so cool that i smiled with amazement. I look at my dad and smiled. My personality was kind and gentle like my father. But unlike my father, i was shy and mostly kept to myself, when i get silent that\u2019s when something isn\u2019t right about me. \n\nYou were with your father Bruce. He was sitting in a chair in front of a computer screen. He talks to you about some of the operations that the computer can do. He noticed you weren\u2019t paying attention. He looks at me and clark who were outside the window. Bruce stands up \u201cCome with me\u201d he said. You stood up and he walked towards a space suit that hung up on a rack. He had a still face as he handed it to you, \u201ci know you want to see Finn\u201d he said knowing you want to hang with me. With that sentence he smiled and you put on the space suit. \n\nLater on in the day, we were in a separate  room that had some toys here and there, and a small game console with a few games. We were hanging out until we hear our parents talk about darkside. A person our parents never talked about around us. I look at you becoming quiet as i hear the conversation. I raise a brow \u201cWho\u2019s darkside?\u201d I whispered to you (continue from there)\n\nConclusion:\nI hope you all liked that starter. Just so i know you read it all. Send the word \u201cSuper friends\u201d and your discord name. Thank you!",

            "selftext": "\n\nHey! I am looking to roleplay in the *Game of Thrones / A Song of Ice and Fire* universe. It had been a while now since the last season was over, which sadly ended in a terrible way. Still, I would like to get back into it and return to Westeros and/or Essos!\n\nAnyway, I prefer to play a female against a male character. Willing to play multiple characters when needed for the plot or **if** the story is going to be more dynamic, aka roleplaying an actual storyline in multiple locations in a bigger scale roleplay. No, I am not looking to play multiple characters for you. If we are to play multiple characters, we share the roles together and divide it. It is more fun that way! Also very open for alternative universes.\n\n\nFeel free to suggest a story for any character you prefer or if you pair them with someone. There might be book only characters or ones not in the main storyline. I am just mentioning all the female characters I am interested in playing.\n\n\n(Italic is for historic characters or ones that didn't appear in the main story, most of them are favourites by default. Bold is for favourite characters of the main storyline, whether in the show or the books, but of course feel free to pick anyone! They are in no particular order.)\n\n-\n\nThe characters I am willing to play:\n\n\n\n\n**Daenerys Targaryen**\n\n\nCersei Lannister \n\n\nVal\n\n\n**Arianne Martell**\n\n\nMelisandre\n\n\nMya Stone\n\n\n**Arya Stark**\n\n\nMargaery Tyrell\n\n\nAsha/Yara Greyjoy\n\n\n**Meera Reed**\n\n\nSansa Stark\n\n\nCatelyn Tully/Stark\n\n\n**Lynesse Hightower**\n\n\nMyrcella Baratheon \n\n\n**Alys Karstark**\n\n\n*Lyanna Stark*\n\n\n*Ashara Dayne*\n\n\n*Rhaella Targaryen*\n\n\n*Elia Martell*\n\n\n*Joanna Lannister*\n\n\n*Rhaelle Targaryen*\n\n\n*Jenny of Oldstones*\n\n\n*Betha Blackwood*\n\n\n*Shiera Seastar*\n\n\n*Daena Targaryen*\n\n\n*Naerys Targaryen*\n\n\n*Princess Daenerys Targaryen (Sister of Daeron II)*\n\n\n*Rhaenys Targaryen (The Queen Who Never Was)*\n\n\n*Daenaera Velaryon*\n\n\n*Alicent Hightower*\n\n\n*Laena Velaryon*\n\n\n*Jocelyn Baratheon*\n\n\n*Alysanne Blackwood*\n\n\n*Rhaenyra Targaryen*\n\n\n*Alyssa Targaryen*\n\n\n*Rhaena Targaryen*\n\n\n*Alysanne Targaryen*\n\n\n*Argella Durrandon*\n\n\n*Visenya Targaryen*\n\n\n*Sharra Arryn*\n\n\n*Rhaenys Targaryen*\n\n\n*Daenys the Dreamer*\n\n\n*Queen Nymeria Martell*\n\n\n\n\n-\n\nThese were just few off the surface of my mind. I think I am open to some more characters. \n\nI 99% will play my characters against a canon character, as long as they match the timeline we pick and are relatively reasonable against the character. I will not play as or against original characters. I wouldn't mind which canon character you pick, again as long as it relatively reasonable to pair him with a character of mine you prefer. As long as they are *not* Ramsay Bolton, Roose Bolton and Joffery Baratheon. Odd pairings are always welcome and sometimes even a plus!\n\n\nI most likely have an idea for almost every character I listed, but feel free to suggest your own ideas, too! They can be as predictable and conventional as possible, or as unique and uncommon as possible, so you don't have to go for the canon or the pairing that makes sense the most.\n\n\nI prefer to build up and to balance story with romance and possible NSFW elements, in order for the story to be engaging and immersive. I write in third person, past tense and my preferred platform for roleplaying is Discord, so make sure to give me your tag when you PM me.\n\n\nHope to hear from you soon.",
