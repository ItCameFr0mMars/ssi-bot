I know The Simpsons is a cartoon, an animated show, a comedy, silly, etc, but it's my favorite show, and after 30+ seasons I've gotten really attached to the characters. I've never roleplayed it, though I've thought about it a lot! And even though it's a cartoon comedy, I think some genuine stories could be written about it.\n\nLet me preface by saying that I only want to write with other adults (18+), and while I'm fine with the characters all being their current ages, I will not write heavy romances with characters like Bart, Lisa, Ralph, Nelson, etc. Little crushes/innocent dates are fine, but nothing 'adult' will be happening with the kid characters (unless we do an AU where they're grown up).\n\nSome ideas I have:\n\n* Lenny and Carl get together\n* Moe finally finds love\n* Lisa dates a woman in college\n* Marge leaves Homer and struggles as a single mother to three kids until marrying someone else, or Homer actually puts in the time and effort it takes to win her back\n* Young adult Bart becomes a criminal with Sideshow Bob as his mentor\n* A pair of male/female twins moves to Springfield and find themselves smitten with Patty and Selma\n* Ned Flanders has a crisis of faith that can't be solved in a 20-minute episode\n\nWe can also explore alternate universes (something that happens in the show itself pretty often!). Please be like...\\*pretty\\* familiar with The Simpsons. I've seen every episode multiple times, am very familiar with the major characters and a lot of the minor ones.\n\nIf you have any ideas, feel free to share!",

            "selftext": "Hello there, your local Game Master looking to write. I'm a trans man, based in the pacific northwest, been roleplaying for too long. Looking for a partner to do some fandom-based roleplays with OCs.\n\n**What I'm looking for:**\n\n\\- Third person, past tense only. I can roleplay on Discord, preferably in private servers, Google docs and e-mail. Do not ask me to join groups/forums.\n\n\\- 2-5 paragraph, fairly literate replies, but I can go longer or shorter depending on the scene. Not looking for novella-length entries.\n\n\\- Can reply daily or weekly, it depends on your schedule. I'd prefer rapid-fire though. I work from home and don't sleep, so I can accommodate most times.\n\n\\- I prefer to DM/GM the story, but I'm pretty flexible on this front.\n\n\\- I love romance, but I can accommodate you for what you'd like. Any pairing is fine, but I prefer playing dudes.\n\n\\- I may ask for a sample or two to see if our writing styles work well together.\n\n\\- OCs! You can make them up for the story or have some ready, but please have some idea of what you'd like to write. I'll do my best to write for you. I don't mind if you want to help me write the story as well, but I love doing it. Promise.\n\n**Fandoms I'm looking for at the moment:**\n\n\\- Final Fantasy XIV\n\nAdditionally, would love to do a more original Final Fantasy style story I've been working on that includes elements from all the games.\n\n\\- Fire Emblem\n\nSimilar to the premise above, I have a story that includes elements from all Fire Emblem games.  Either based around the older, more war-driven series (the Blazing/Binding games are my favorite) or something to do with a school like in Three Houses. I have made up my own map, ocs, professors, ect - would love to add your OC to the fold!\n\n\\- Digimon, Season 1 or 3, or Hacker's Memory and its prequel.\n\n\\- Mobile Suit Gundam, mostly based in the UC timeline but some of the AU stuff such as the Post Disaster or Build series is fine too.\n\n\\- In tandem with the above, I'd also love to do more Super Robot Wars style stories.\n\n\\- The World Ends With You\n\n\\- Super Smash Brothers\n\nI just think the World of Light has a lot of fun/dramatic potential as a crossover story.\n\nThanks for taking the time to check out my ad! If you dig any of this, send me a DM with what your favorite movie is at the moment, and have an excellent day.",

            "selftext": "The title sounds boring, I'm aware. But I'm thinking of something kind of different for this. \n\nSome things before I begin. I'm 19, **so please be 18+. I will not RP with minors.**\n\nSecond, I'm looking for people that are looking for a casual thing. I do write a couple of paragraphs, but I'm not looking for a giant Bible that I can't respond to. \n\nThird, ok with some dark/mature themes. Cults, vampirism, gore, possible other kinds of things like this. \n\nAnyway, onto the idea.\n\nI've been having this craving for vampires in RP so... (blame the video game, Vampyr tbh, with a dash of Anne Rice style vampires, if you will) \n\nI had this idea of like, a medieval vampire cult that believes they're abominations of nature so rather than go out and feed/making themselves powerful, they straight up gouge out their eyes (I see this being justified as, *if they can't see, it makes it harder to seek out prey, and thus they can't act out their monstrous urges*) and for the most part, starved themselves to the point where it was easier to find a safe place underground in order to live out the rest of their existence in a state of limbo. I'll imagine that the extremity of these actions is due to cultish fanatism, so it seems logical to them but totally messed up and irrational to literally everyone else. \n\nAnyway, the vampire character was in this cult, wholeheartedly believed in its ways. And when they went underground to essentially lock themselves up, he saw no problem with this because it's just what was expected of him. (He might have even seen it as an honor, honestly).\nSo, several hundred years pass, he's practically  shriveled up and his conscious just *barely* there. Kinda like floating in nothingness for the entire time. Except, suddenly his coffin is being disturbed. This doesn't wake him up right away, because he's weak/starved, possibly used to occasionally sparks in his mental state. So it's whatever. \nOnly, his coffin is being *moved* and he starts hearing voices talking around him in a strange manner that he doesn't recognize the dialect or accent, and half of the words don't make sense to him. \n\nSomehow, he ends up waking. But he's extremely weak. (And of course he can't see!)\n\nOn the human side, I'll imagine that the way this guy encountered the old vampire cult underground place is if he's some type of archeologist (which kinda seems apt... for the time period haha). Dude probably thought they found a mummy or a really corpse, because the vampire character is just *that* much in a rough shape. But it's neat because woah! Nerdy stuff!\nMaybe while examining the coffin, he gets too close to the \"corpse\" because he's just all so excited about this new find and the vampire character starts hearing his heartbeat, almost *smelling* him or what not. Then boom, instincts kick in and he latches onto his neck. \nOf course, the human guy is, at this point, kinda stronger than a starved, blind vampire so he does manage to push him off. \n\nOops, human character now has a literal ticking time bomb in his hands. Shenanigans ensue. \n\nIf you're interested:\nI have email, discord, or just reddit if you'll prefer.",

The airport was almost deserted now, most had made their flights from the major airport hub to their destinations for the holidays. Her first flight was delayed, then customs held her for too long in LA. and she missed the rescheduled flight. She found a new one but it had a connector in Georgia, and somehow she missed that flight.\n\nTwice she had calculated the gas and rental car cost of the 24 hour drive home\u2026 She had not seen her family in 10 years. The suitcases filled with toys for her nephew, and a special bourbon for her Dad. Could she make it by Christmas? How long can someone stay awake on caffeine? \n\nThe 30 year old woman was now riding her largest rolling suitcase down the moving walk-ways as she made her way to the rental car counter. The silliness of sleep deprivation and a long journey were catching up to her. She had traveled from Japan, with 150 pounds of crap for her family. She was determined to make it home. \n\nThe rental counter was still open. There was only one person in line. Her steps picked up pace, this was her answer. One long classic rock playlist and she would be home, but as the man finished at the counter ahead of her the cleric slid a sign over that said \u201csold-out\u201d. The long lonely wail of anguish that bubbled up from her soul escaped her mouth as a pathetic and sad moan. Her vision blurred instantly tears always seem to sting at first\u2026.. \n\n((Howdy!! How are you? Did you like that little intro idea for a story? I would like to write something like this quick little one off story of two strangers getting stuck together for a while. Maybe you're the guy at the counter who just got a car? And we happen to be going near the same place? Or maybe you are an airline pilot or worker who can somehow help Miriam get home? There is a lot of space for the journey to face more delay or tension. And even room for romance if you wouldn\u2019t mind writing that way with me.\n\nA little about me, the writer. I am a female, 36 year old, ole school Roleplayer, I have been playing off (mostly off)  and on since the ages of AOL chat rooms. I like to use Google Docs if it\u2019s a long term role play, or discord if the intention is quick back and forth. I am pacific coast time, can be very long winded if called and will have loads of time during the next few weeks because work is very slow during the holidays for me. Help keep me occupied and feeling a little less lonely?))",

Usually I\u2019ve taken a looong break from writing fandom stuff, usually I write dramatic, modern slow burn stuff but I\u2019ve gotten nostalgic for the wizarding world recently. I do have an idea or two in mind, but am also looking forward to hearing other plot ideas! \n\nThat being said, I would prefer we write as original characters, set in the wizarding world. (I know there are different \u2018eras\u2019? You\u2019d have to explain them to me.) I write third person, multi-para/novella style, and vastly prefer real-life face claims versus anime and art. I like private servers and I keep everything organized and keep all my character info tucked away in a doc c: I do prefer F/M pairings and am willing to double, and provide a cast of side characters of all genders.  I am a sucker for romance, so I am totally okay with that being a subplot. It\u2019s also encouraged cause I\u2019m a softie for that kind of stuff. That isn\u2019t to say it should be sickeningly sweet and fluffy all the time \u2014 I like plots of a darker, grittier vein. Slytherin/Death Eater vibes, ya feel?  I wanna write characters who are morally grey at best. It would be best if you were similar in rp style, and it would be even better if you provided a writing sample c: I use discord primary for out of character, and in character replies. I can be convinced to use google docs to rp and use discord for ooc though. \n\nFor my comfort, I would like to write as adults in the wizarding world. Characters who are professors, or shopkeepers, that sort of thing\u2026 I do understand the appeal of being a student in Hogwarts, though \u2014 so if that is the case our characters would be aged up, and Hogwarts would have to serve more as a university. I do not write with characters under 21. Please include your favorite Harry Potter character in your message so i know you\u2019ve read my whole ad! \n\nI look forward to receiving some messages! :)",

I've been looking around for a specific thread and I was hoping to find it here. \n\nRules and general overview:\n\n- I am a 26F so no minors, please. If possible, I would prefer my rp partner to be 23+\n\n- I will do my best to reply but work has gotten very busy especially considering the holidays at the end of this month. I have been losing a bit of my usual steam to roleplay because of it so I will try to reply every one to two days. If the delay is longer, I'll let you know and get back to you as soon as I can!\n\n- While I do have Rp sideblogs on Tumblr, I do prefer to rp on Discord\n\n- I want you to have fun in this thread! Please speak your mind. If you're not enjoying or have ideas on what else we could toss into the thread, please tell me! If you're not liking where things are going or if you've lost the motivation/inspiration, let me know and we can drop the thread. Please do not ghost me. \n\n- I am open to a little bit of romance with our characters. As along as there's chemistry going on between them and it isn't forced\n\n- I do Rp third person and use a paragraph style in writing\n\n- Right now, I'm not looking for a Halo centric plot\n\nPlot:\n\nSo the plot I have been looking for, just for fun, is a Halo-Gears of War crossover. Mainly I'd drop in my Spartan IV character into that universe via space-time magic and go on from there. My partner got me into the Gears games back when the quarantine hit and we played through the first three games. I was thinking it could take place probably just before the second game begins.\n\nI really want to have my character interact with Delta team as I had a lot of fun with them in game and I was thinking of possibly pairing her up with Baird as he has grown on me. Plus I'm sure he'd be majorly interested in her tech. \n\nI can forward over any references and details on my character! If you are interested, either comment on this post or PM me.\n\nI may only take on one or two people at the most due to IRL work. \n\nThank you for reading!",

Knowing the whole world plot-wise and character-wise is no need. As long as they have the surface knowledge of the setting I believe we\u2019re all to make a good little roleplay for me and you.\n\nI have many prompts but what I\u2019m looking for are Ghoul x Human(CCG/Civilian) romances. If you\u2019re wanting to play as the ghoul feel free to make up anything as you like. I\u2019m not judging you if you\u2019re going to make a pretty powerful OC. As long as you do their character correctly. Also, I solely roleplay as Male. Real-life girls will kill me if they knew how I would roleplay female characters online... \n\nMy Discord will be revealed in the PMs. Just hit me up with a hello and a character idea!",

I work full time so I know I don't always have the best schedule and I don't expect anyone else to, but I am looking for a long term roleplaying partner that is literate and easygoing. I write a minimum of one paragraph per post but can easily do more and tend to match with my partner. I don't have a particular preference for time periods or genre as I always love a good story, typically with some sense of adventure and some romance thrown in. I am not afraid of exploring dark or mature themes though for such things in a story.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always have a number of ideas for different stories but tend to have a hard time settling on just one. I tend to go overboard when it comes to world building and crafting a setting and making a character tends to fall secondary until I find a good partner and can make a character that balances well with them (be it as a foil or a good partner). If you have any ideas you haven't been able to use or any genre/setting that you haven't been able to find a partner for let me know and we should be able to work something out.\n\nHere are a few ideas/settings in particular I have been wanting to use, in no particular order:\n\n\\- Star Wars (Old Republic, Mandalorian, Sith, etc)\n\n\\- Super Heroes (Realistic and gritty or based off of Marvel)\n\n\\- Victorian or Industrial Revolution Era Vampire stories\n\n\\- Greek/Egyptian Mythology (in ancient times or modern day)\n\n\\- Dragons (various settings)\n\n\\- Post Apocalyptic\n\n\\- Sci-Fi (mecha or exploratory)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nif any of those catch your fancy send me a message and let's see if we can work something out!",

The poor young man was shaking so much that he had to stop, he couldn\u2019t run fast enough, so he hid behind a tree, his shaking hands covering his mouth attempting to stop his chattering teeth from clicking\u2026.he prayed in silence as a series of monstrous thumps got terribly closer, and the large presence was so opressive in nature that it sounded like time and space itself had become bended by it, a deafening whistling sound invaded his ears, the whistling kept growing louder and more intense\u2026until it suddenly disappeared, but in its stead.. The Witch\u2019s croaky voice spoke: \u201cyou\u2019ve wasted your chance\u201d.\n\nThose words and that forest were the only things he remembered from his past, he couldn\u2019t recall anything from before that event, and all he knew now was the things he must do, however ugly and abysmal these acts might be, he knew in his mind\u2026in his bones, in his blood, that only suffering comes when he cannot reach the goals which the horrid voice sets for him. \n\nAnd there he was, in the broken famine-struck province of Larsil, following the foggy voice of The Witch which reached his mind even when she was a hundred leagues away, with a broken odd sword on his hip, and strange markings of an otherwordly language riding the skin of his arms, alone searching for something dreadful\u2026or someone. &gt;&gt;\n\nHello, that was a sample of my writing style but also a sample of the tone and style of the story/universe I\u2019m looking for, I still have no defined ideas for plot and characters and world building but I\u2019m confident in the fact that, with the right partner, we\u2019ll end up creating something interesting and fun, something \u201csemi\u201d-literate and exciting. Creativity being the most seeked-for quality here, so PLEASE don\u2019t shy away from coming up with stories and characters!!! It doesn\u2019t really matter how long your responses are or how intricate your descriptions can be.  \n This RP has a morose tone so please think of a character which would fit the setting and general atmosphere of this grimdark fantasy with elements of horror and fantastical mystery. I am not looking for someone to play \u201cThe Witch\u201d as that character isn\u2019t present for most of the story, I prefer characters with macabre motivations who are ambiguous and morally grey (please take the time to think of a very brief bio for your character before messaging).  \n The magic of this world could be described as a rather soft magic system, witches in this world are more similar to the classical early medieval witch image, however it does not mean that all of them are automatically evil as, in this world, nothing seems to be absolute\u2026or even true.  \n Whether other fantastical races and creatures exist in this world is up to discussion.",

( For my character ) | So basically, your character has fallen in love with another in 1A after being at UA for a month now. You two would start dating soon after, causing for the Hanahaki Disease to begin. My guy would play it off as nothing when you'd talk to them with your partner by their side, pretending nothing's wrong.*\n\n***It's a little short because that's just the plot I had in mind, we can discuss it if you have questions or change some details if you want! :)***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Canon/OC or Canon/Canon | 1A Member Turns Into A Villain! | Pretty much, an attack would happen by the 1A dorms. The league of Villains would take you or I and turn them into one of them using certain drugs. The one who hasn't been taken plans a mission to go retrieve them and turn them back, somewhat like Bakugo's situatio*n.\n\n***If it were to be Bakugo and Deku, I'd imagine Deku being the one who was taken... :V***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Canon/Oc or Canon/Canon | 1A UA Traitor Theory! | Turns out Present Mic was right, there was a traitor amongst UA, it has been found that they were within 1A due to a private investigation. Each class had been told that different events would be going around the school on different dates, none of them were the same. It has been narrowed down to Class 1A as they had been told the same date and time was when the League of Villains decided (If that makes sense??) to attack. About a week later one of our characters would catch the other sneaking away in the middle of the night to meet with the leader of the LOV, Shigaraki Tomura. The character who had caught them sneaking away would flee the scene without being spotted, unsure of what to do now.*\n\n***It's up to us on what to do with this information.***  \n\n\n&gt;!Message me \"CallMeCarson\" before saying your interested otherwise I'll just ignore you...!&lt;",

If you\u2019re interested by the title, please continue reading this post, as I\u2019ll explain a bit more.\n\nSo the general idea for this roleplay is that somehow, it doesn\u2019t matter how much to me, but somehow two complete strangers meet close to Christmas. Wether this be a hitchhiker on a long car journey, strangers sat next to each other on a flight or something else entirely, I\u2019m up for it. As long as our characters can have a long conversation. Of course, we can add some other elements into this like mystery, romance or anything else really! As long as there\u2019s two strangers who meet each other!\n\nThis roleplay can either be short term or longterm, I don\u2019t really mind, whichever my partner prefers really. We can discuss more once you message me!\n\nIf this very brief idea sounds like something you can be interested in then hit me up! I look forward to hearing from you.",

I'm over 20 and don't really feel comfortable writing with minors\n2. Discord only, i've found its my preferred method of roleplay\n3. Be able to write with detail. I'm not picky about post length, you don't have to write me a novel every reply. Just give me something to work with with each reply!\n\nThat's about it! I'm not super strict on anything as long as you can write decently and don't give me one liners all the time then we'll be good to go!  \nNow into what i'm looking for. I'd love something with Fantasy in it. Medieval or modern preferably, love those ones. Something with a lot of drama, angst, what have you. I'm sure we can come up with something intriguing once you message me but that's sort of the idea i'm leaning toward. I'm open to most things though so if you have a really good idea or are dying to play something pitch it to me and we'll see what we can do! I'm also only looking for MxM pairings!  \nSend me a PM and tell me a bit about yourself when you do! I love little intros when people message me. Please don't message me only asking if i'm still looking, I won't reply to those. Thanks and I hope to hear from some of you soon!",

            "selftext": "Thank you for taking the time to look at my post. Before we get started, here's a bit about me. I am a 20 year old university student with a lot of time on my hands given that it is Christmas break. I'm seeking people interested in creating original worlds with super heroes. These can be science fiction, fantasy, a more realistic world or anything in between! I'd love to write with you assuming you meet the following qualifications:\n\n1. Someone creative. This is my advertisement, so I don't expect you to come with a meticulously planned story, but this is a partnership; just like any relationship one person giving 100% just is not going to work.\n2. Someone 18+. I'm 20 and am just not super comfortable writing with someone underage.\n3. Someone who cares. People make mistakes all the time, and that's okay! I am looking for someone who is okay with me making mistakes but also types as though he cares. I don't like setting a minimum length requirement because it isn't always necessary or handy but I do like enough content that I can build on every post.\n4. Someone who communicates. I get that this is probably the least important thing in your life. It's pretty low on my totem poll too. Still, waiting for a response that will never come can hurt. If something isn't working, or you just need to take a while, just let me know. I won't be offended unless you don't tell me.\n5. Someone who writes third person past tense. This is the only way I write, sorry!\n\nThanks for looking through all that! Now, to the fun stuff. I am seeking someone who is interested in writing about super people! While I don't have anything too concrete, I have some ideas for both characters and settings which I've been wanting to try out all themed around super people. (I write and write against OCs only.)  If you're interested after all that, I'd love to hear from you.",

            "selftext": "\n\nHey! I am looking to roleplay in the *Game of Thrones / A Song of Ice and Fire* universe. It had been a while now since the last season was over, which sadly ended in a terrible way. Still, I would like to get back into it and return to Westeros and/or Essos!\n\nAnyway, I prefer to play a female against a male character. Willing to play multiple characters when needed for the plot or **if** the story is going to be more dynamic, aka roleplaying an actual storyline in multiple locations in a bigger scale roleplay. No, I am not looking to play multiple characters for you. If we are to play multiple characters, we share the roles together and divide it. It is more fun that way! Also very open for alternative universes.\n\n\nFeel free to suggest a story for any character you prefer or if you pair them with someone. There might be book only characters or ones not in the main storyline. I am just mentioning all the female characters I am interested in playing.\n\n\n(Italic is for historic characters or ones that didn't appear in the main story, most of them are favourites by default. Bold is for favourite characters of the main storyline, whether in the show or the books, but of course feel free to pick anyone! They are in no particular order.)\n\n-\n\nThe characters I am willing to play:\n\n\n\n\n**Daenerys Targaryen**\n\n\nCersei Lannister \n\n\nVal\n\n\n**Arianne Martell**\n\n\nMelisandre\n\n\nMya Stone\n\n\n**Arya Stark**\n\n\nMargaery Tyrell\n\n\nAsha/Yara Greyjoy\n\n\nMeera Reed\n\n\nSansa Stark\n\n\nCatelyn Tully/Stark\n\n\nLynesse Hightower\n\n\nMyrcella Baratheon \n\n\n**Alys Karstark**\n\n\n*Lyanna Stark*\n\n\n*Ashara Dayne*\n\n\n*Rhaella Targaryen*\n\n\n*Elia Martell*\n\n\n*Joanna Lannister*\n\n\n*Rhaelle Targaryen*\n\n\n*Jenny of Oldstones*\n\n\n*Betha Blackwood*\n\n\n*Rohanne Webber*\n\n\n*Shiera Seastar*\n\n\n*Daena Targaryen*\n\n\n*Naerys Targaryen*\n\n\n*Princess Daenerys Targaryen (Sister of Daeron II)*\n\n\n*Rhaenys Targaryen (The Queen Who Never Was)*\n\n\n*Daenaera Velaryon*\n\n\n*Alicent Hightower*\n\n\n*Laena Velaryon*\n\n\n*Jocelyn Baratheon*\n\n\n*Alysanne Blackwood*\n\n\n*Rhaenyra Targaryen*\n\n\n*Alyssa Targaryen*\n\n\n*Rhaena Targaryen*\n\n\n*Alysanne Targaryen*\n\n\n*Argella Durrandon*\n\n\n*Visenya Targaryen*\n\n\n*Sharra Arryn*\n\n\n*Rhaenys Targaryen*\n\n\n*Daenys the Dreamer*\n\n\n*Queen Nymeria Martell*\n\n\n\n\n-\n\nThese were just few off the surface of my mind. I think I am open to some more characters. \n\nI 99% will play my characters against a canon character, as long as they match the timeline we pick and are relatively reasonable against the character. I will not play as or against original characters. I wouldn't mind which canon character you pick, again as long as it relatively reasonable to pair him with a character of mine you prefer. As long as they are *not* Ramsay Bolton, Roose Bolton and Joffery Baratheon. Odd pairings are always welcome and sometimes even a plus!\n\n\nI most likely have an idea for almost every character I listed, but feel free to suggest your own ideas, too! They can be as predictable and conventional as possible, or as unique and uncommon as possible, so you don't have to go for the canon or the pairing that makes sense the most.\n\n\nI prefer to build up and to balance story with romance in order for the story to be engaging and immersive. I write in third person, past tense and my preferred platform for roleplaying is Discord, so make sure to give me your tag when you PM me.",

Communication, both IC and OOC, will be greatly appreciated and happily returned.\n\nThis is an ad for a story set in the universe of a **Song of Ice and Fire**, regardless of timeline. I have more experience with pre or post rebellion plots, but I'll happily brainstorm other things. Canon or OC women is something I'm familiar with: I've tried my hand at diverse characters, from Shiera Seastar to Alys Karstark.\n\nMy current craving features House Targaryen, but I'm more than happy to discuss anything and everything in a potential plot. Christmas break has given me room for one more story, so I've leaped to the chance.\n\nPlease PM if interested, be safe, and thanks for reading!",

            "selftext": "Hello, this is all based on a dream I had(and ironically for my favorite tale)! Little about me first is that I'm eighteen years old, so be close to that or a little older. I'm more comfortable that way. You can also just call me Dovah. I've been writing for eight years, as well as roleplaying. So I'm definitely not new to this, and have been on various platforms. I'll be working on the starter I have in mind, but we can always discuss it!\n\nWho I play: Eliza.\n\nWho you play: The Beast(or whatever you want to make him!! Could be a cruel Fae/Elven, Orc, etc!).\n\n\n\nSummary of my idea: It's based around this college student named Eliza, who performs at the cities theater from time to time and was just recently casted to portray Belle. Which she is ecstatic for, the tale is special and important to her and helped her through hardships. \n\nExcept, she wasn't lucky in the parent department. Eliza's mother expects too much from her, criticizes her love for literature and the arts. Berates her, belittles, judges and has tried forcing her into law school even tried throwing her to business. Her father left her as a young child, so she couldn't go to him to escape. before Eliza had decided to go no contact with her mother, and moved into her own studio apartment. \n\nEliza is at rehearsal one day, the first one for Belle. Come the scene where she goes to touch the rose, a pink light had burst from the one on set. She looked around and found everyone gone, and a scream left her as the floor dropped beneath her and found herself going down a spiralling blue portal. However, its mouth opened a few feet up in the air, leaving her to fall into a pile of snow. Sitting up, she's faced with a very large castle. Who would've witnessed this?",

Ideally this would be a long term romance story but with all the drama and suspense that happens in Riverdale. I would prefer a detailed and literate partner who has some knowledge of Riverdale and it's storyline.

            "selftext": "Hello! I\u2019m Austin (22M), and as the title implies, I\u2019d like to do a Percy Jackson roleplay. I\u2019ve been an avid reader of the series ever since I could read for myself, and had my parents reading it to me since before that. \n\nI\u2019ve been roleplaying for a little over 10 years now, Percy Jackson being one of the first series I was apart of. I was apart of quite a few different communities, such as Wattpad, Amino, Instagram, Geek King, and even an old art app called Spraycan. Those days were fun, and I certainly miss them. Above all, I had a wonderful group Percy Jackson roleplay which I miss to this day. We even had a theme song for the group, Toxic by Brittany Spears. I doubt I\u2019ll ever find them again, though it would be incredible if I did. But that\u2019s not what I\u2019m here for. \n\nAfter the announcement of the Disney+ Percy Jackson series, I was floored. I started to reread the series, and I got to wondering if there were others who were also looking to roleplay in this particular fandom after such a long time.\n\nI don\u2019t have any scenarios or plots picked out as I\u2019m typing this, but I can come up with one rather quickly as needed. I would also love to hear any ideas someone else brings to the table, or would happily construct one with you. \n\nMy rules are as follows: \n\nBecause I am 22, I ask you are at least 18 or older. I am not looking to make this an NSFW roleplay, but I personally do not feel comfortable roleplaying with an underage individual.\n\nI am quite a lengthy writer when I want to be. I do not require you match my exact length, but at least two paragraphs in a response would be what I\u2019m hoping for. I usually try to match what my partner is doing. \n\nI do not roleplay canon characters. I don\u2019t think I can do them justice. The decisions I would make are not always that of what a canon character\u2019s would be. That being said though, I am more than alright if you want to roleplay a canon character. \n\nRomance isn\u2019t really my central focus. I\u2019m a sap for it, don\u2019t get me wrong, but I find myself getting bored if that\u2019s the point of the roleplay, or if that\u2019s all we focus on. I\u2019m fine with developing a relationship, but I want it to be natural. Along those lines, I am a straight male, and roleplay as such. I do not find myself capable of roleplaying an LGBT+ character with any justice. \n\nDue to the nature of Rick Riordan\u2019s universe, the Greek and Roman gods are not the only deities to exist in the Percy Jackson universe. You are welcome to incorporate any other mythology into this. I am not picky. \n\nI ask you don\u2019t god-mod your character. I like there to be stakes.\n\nPlease do not control my character for me. Nine times out of ten I\u2019ll happily do as you plan, so long as you ask me beforehand.\n\nI use Discord, Kik, and Reddit PMs/DMs. Feel free to let me know which you prefer if/when you message me!",

            "selftext": "Right-o. Hi, I'm not sure how to do this (the whole ad making thing) so bear with me. I'm looking for a Lit RP, though that doesn't mean I've got a magnifying glass and I'm over here watching your average post length. Really, so long as you keep things detailed and interesting I'll be a happy camper. I mostly want to do fandom rps. AUs are pretty much the spice of life for me, so I'd like if you were fond of AUs too. It's mostly anime and vidya, to save you time if you're not interested in those things. I wouldn't be against doing something completely original with our own characters. I mostly write mxm but I'm also not against het if I like whatever idea you're bringing to the table. The fandoms I'm interested in are as followed:  \n\n\\-Attack on Titan (it is perhaps, my favorite thing ever) \n\n\\-JJBA \n\n\\-Devilman \n\n\\-Noragami \n\n\\-Durarara\n\n\\-D.N.Angel \n\n\\-Get Backers\n\n\\-Descendants of Darkness \n\n\\-Seraph of the End\n\n\\-Neon Genesis Evangelion \n\n\\-Gurren Lagann \n\n\\-Hetalia\n\nBelow are RPs where OCs would make sense to me. Also we could probably just combine it with an above fandom:\n\n\\-Howl's Moving Castle\n\n\\-Shiki \n\n\\-Resident Evil\n\n\\-Metro 2033/Last Light/Exodus \n\n\\-Frostpunk \n\nThere are other things I'm into but it's hard to think of it on the spot haha. Well... If you're interested, hit me up and we can talk about things. Hopefully I made this ad correctly. Please don't be rude, by the way. You can be the best roleplayer in the world but if I don't like you as a person it's probably not going to work out.",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone! I am a huge Star Wars fan and have always wanted to play out some sort of roleplay within the universe. I came up with two scenario ideas that I think would be a lot of fun to play out and I'm also more than welcome to hear any ideas you may have!\n\nScenario 1: Light and Dark\n\nThis scenario can pretty much take place anytime in the universe. It would be a story of someone from the light and dark falling for each other. For example: if it takes place during the time of the original trilogy perhaps my character is a rebel soldier who is captured and brought on board the death star. Once there he meets your character who is a part of the empires forces. Something along those lines!\n\nScenario 2: A post ROS romance with Rey. (SPOILERS FOR RISE OF SKYWALKER)\n\n\nThis scenario would take place after the fall of the first order in the ROS and obviously after Ben's death. A few scattered first order supporters still remain scattered across the galaxy, attempting to reignite the flame and continue what Palpatine and Kylo attempted. Rey and her rebels continue to travel and fight them off, taking them down planet by planet and rescuing any of those who have been captive. During this time, my character (a rebel soldier or maybe even a force sensitive person she meets along the way) becomes rather close to her and a romance blossums.\n\nThose are the two ideas I have! I'd love to hear any additions you'd like to make to them and so on, as well as any other ideas for scenarios that you may have. So feel free to send me a message or a chat!.\n\nAs this will be a romantic roleplay I must ask that any participants and characters are 18+ due to the adult scenes that may arise when necessary.",

            "selftext": "I've always loved fantasy settings and would like to run a long term one based very loosely on Warhammer. Particularly the rat people known as skaven. (No need to have lore knowledge of the Warhammer world. Just used for inspiration!)\n\nNow the general gist of my idea is a human and a monster that under normal circumstances would be bitter enemies trying to kill eachother wind up as friends. Eventually growing into a close bond. Perhaps even developing into something romantic. Im looking for a Female to play as the rat. My ideal partner would be descriptive and open minded and able to think on their feet!\n\nHeres the general setup!\n\nA human flees a raid on their village. Clutching a spear with blood running down their arm and burns from the town being razed. A foreign invader marauding across the land. After running as far as he can the, survivor collapses in exhaustion. Light fading from their eyes. Ready for death to embrace them until a strange humanoid creature approaches. A ratkin, One of the last of its clan sees an opportunity to scoop up some fresh meat. Scooping him up and carrying him to her den. She is the thing nightmares are made of. And he awakens in a dark rat den. The beast surprised hes still alive gets to talking to him. Probing him for answers about his kind. Perhaps with valuable enough information she could be welcomed into a new clan? Maybe hes better kept alive?\n\nThe beast tends to the wounds and saves his life and from there they get to talking. Slowly the relationship changing from that of a prisoner and their captive, to that of friends. And eventually more. They then look after eachother as they survive a hostile and otherwise lonely world.\n\nFeel free to suggest any changes, and specific details are always up for a change.

            "selftext": "Everyone had thought that the Greek gods and all those stories about monsters and heroes were just myths. Fancy stories created by the great Greek authors and philosophers. After all, there were no signs of all those strange creatures and mythical beasts--and other nations had their own pantheons, the Norse, the Egyptians...yet each had wildly different stories. No one believed them any more, at least, not until the day that all of those myths came crashing back down to Earth.\n\nCenturies ago the Gods of Olympus and humans had begun to go to war, humanity blaming the gods for all of their problems. And surprisingly enough, the humans were actually beginning to come out on top. With their pride wounded and their god-hood on the line, the Greek Gods abandoned the mortal realm, shutting the gates of Olympus and drawing their magic out from the realm. It was said that this was when the the Greek fell and became the Romans, casting aside the old names of the gods with new versions and tales. Yet with the powers gone so to were many of the memories, save for those written down as stories.\n\nNo one is quite sure why the gods chose to return now, but as soon as Olympus reappeared so too did the magic of the gods. Bloodlines that had long run dormant began to reemerge, beasts and creatures that had been reverted into natural forms once more returned to their former glory. Almost overnight the world became a very, very different place. Beasts of great power broke free from zoos and prowled the mountains and woods that were their homes. Humans awoke with powers beyond their imagination, or in completely different shapes and forms than what they had once been.\n\nIt has been a few years since Olympus returned and reopened Pandora's box upon the world. And all in all, things still are not great. The emergence of Demi-gods and mythological beasts created quite the stir, with some nations even falling or rising because of them. Many still face persecution, either at the hands of the powerful Demi-Gods, or for being cursed humans such as Minotaurs, Cyclops, or Medusas. Thus, the Mythological Protection Agency was formed. A special international organization devoted to protecting the rights of all Mythological creatures, while also working to enforce fair treatment on humans from Mythological creatures. For many the MPA are a sign of peace between Humans and Myths, though there are also those who believe the MPA are fools who stand in the way of Myths and Demi-Gods from truly reclaiming their full glory and ruling over the mortals.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------\n\nIf you have made it this far then good day to you. I am looking for a literate roleplaying partner to expand upon this idea with. The main idea would center around one (or more) MPA agents as they work to try and keep the peace in a modern day world that has been plagued by the emergence of all those things that used to just be myths and stories. My own character will likely be an MPA agent though different ideas can be rolled about. One can be a mythological creature, a Demi-God, or even just a regular ol' human trying to do good in the world.\n\nAll I ask is that you be literate and be able to post at least once a day or so. I work full time so I understand real life gets in the way (a lot) but don't be afraid to let me know if something is going on. I am happy to chat ooc and hang out, and I myself am in my 'mid to late' twenties and prefer that my partner be at least 18+ just for brevity's sake. Depending on your preferences this could get into dark and mature themes so that is another reason for that little requirement. If all of this tickles your fancy feel free to send me a message and we can start working out the details. See you around\\~",

            "selftext": "The year is 2077 and economic crisis culminating in nuclear conflict has left America in pieces. With most of the continent degenerating into lawless war-zones people from all over have converged on the already overcrowded Night City, one of the worlds last great Megalopolises. A hub amassing the best in resources and know-how and home to manufacturers of cutting edge technologies, Night City continues to offer the promise of a civilized future but in the city streets a merciless struggle for power rages. Gangs, corporate agents, hustlers, religious cultists, politicians, and all manner of criminals strive to outplay one another. Ordinary people get caught in the crossfire.   \n\n\nWith Cyberpunk 2077 having just released and me being a big fan of the genre in general I've been very fixated on the idea of exploring Night City, our characters a pair of solos getting involved in shady deals, dangerous gangs, and the Night City nightlife all for a chance to make it big or die trying.   \n\n\nAbout me a bit, I'm a 22 year old student who's between semesters right now and works part time so I've got more free time than I really know what to do with. I'd really like someone who just likes to chat as well as RP, chat about our characters or RP ideas or just friendly small talk. I think it makes for more fun when I get along with the person I'm roleplaying with. Anyways, if you're interested shoot me a message and we can figure out where to start.",

            "selftext": "Hello reddit! Today I am looking for someone who would be interested in doing a Star Wars roleplay with me. I am a giant Star Wars nerd and I know my way around lore pretty well, and of course I am not afraid of doing my homework if there is something I do not know. I have multiple OC\u2019s ready for any plot, if you need help building your OC, Just ask. I have a few plots that I will jot down, but if you have an idea for a plot feel free to share. \n\nA bit about myself now. My name is Selkie and I am 21 years old. I have been writing since I was thirteen, starting roleplaying on many different sites. My style would be advanced-literate to semi-literate and I only write in the third person. As for my life outside of roleplay, I am a quiet private person so I won't divulge much. What I will say is that I am a busy person, so don\u2019t be expecting me to reply every second of every day. That is all I have to say about me, if you have any questions please ask!\n\nNow it is time for me to preface what I want from you. I want you to have a bit of knowledge of Star Wars lore, especially if it pertains to the character you are playing. Like don\u2019t come wanting to play a Mandalorian without you knowing anything about Mandalorians. You don\u2019t have to be perfect, there are a bunch of things I don\u2019t know, but I do my research. Now for your writing style. Please, please, please, be at least semi-literate! I prefer writing with people who are advanced-literate, but I will be happy to roleplay with someone who is only semi-literate. I will not roleplay with you if you write less than a paragraph. I have dealt with it before and I find it boring. As for how you write. I prefer third person to the other forms, I find first to be clunky and second does not apply. Now grammar, I am very loose with this so you don\u2019t have to worry so hard. Of course I would prefer for you to be very mindful of what you write, capitalization and punctuation wise, but a mistake here and there don\u2019t matter much.\n\nPut your favorite color in your title if you read this far. \n\nPlots:\n\n* This story starts on an unimportant planet in an inconsequential system, one of those planets that is perfect for someone who wants to get out of the public eye, someone like you. Back in your day you were known throughout the galaxy as someone who had no fear, a person who would looked danger in the eye and smiled. Your enemies feared you and your allies adored you, but to both sides surprise, one day you vanished. After you disappeared there were rumors of your death. Stories of your hubris taking control and leading you down a path that would lead to your doom. There were others though that held onto the hope that you survived, my character being one of them. What happens when my character is able to track you down, will she be able to convince you to go on one last adventure, or are you done with that lifestyle? \\[You don\u2019t have to play the retired adventurer, I just felt it was easier writing it this way.\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Everyone knew one thing about the Mandalorians and that was that they were to be feared and respected. A warrior race that lives by a strict creed, honor is one of the many things that the Mandalorians hold dear to them, never breaking their word. One day, a Mandalorian is contracted to be a bodyguard to a very important person, escorting them from one planet to another. Swearing on their creed to promise to do all that the person would ask of them, the Mandalorian finds themselves in a bind when the person they are sworn  to protect keeps getting them into trouble. \\[Please have knowledge of Mandalorians if you choose to be the Mandalorian, otherwise I would be happy to play them.\\]",

            "selftext": "Hi everyone! I\u2019m currently looking for people to do a fantasy roleplay with. I have an OC that I would love to create another story with, as I love the concept of the character.\n\nName: Silas Roseblood\n\nBackstory: He was a normal boy until his village was destroyed by Orcs. Their leader killed his parents in front of him, but Silas was able to escape. He became a ranger, sticking more to the forests than the towns.\n\nHe is a cold, cynical character who is searching for revenge on the orcs who killed his family. Your character can be literally anything you want! A princess who is sick of royal life? A criminal who needs to escape the law? A shady elf who had a gang after them? I\u2019d be happy to do a story with any of them!\n\nFor a bit of info on me, I\u2019m 18, I\u2019m in EST, and I\u2019ve been rping for a few years now. I usually write a few paragraphs, and I write in third person past tense. I\u2019ve used this character before, but I\u2019m always looking for another chance to use him! I\u2019d like this story to include romance, as I think it improves any plot. \n\nIn addition to this, I\u2019m open to a few fandoms. Marvel, DC, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Kingdom Hearts, and maybe more if I think fo them! For Marvel, I\u2019d be best at playing Peter Parker, and for DC I\u2019d be best as Nightwing or Bruce Wayne. Otherwise, I\u2019d most likely be an OC.\n\nI can\u2019t wait to hear from you if you decide to message me! And even if you don\u2019t, have a wonderful day!",

Well not actually but meh xD.\nSo basically I'm here once again looking for someone to roleplay with me, in anyway possible. But gay. Yes please.\nA bit about myself. I'm not a native speaker therefore sometimes i need to think about the stuff I want to write longer. I prefer playing first person, but I can do 3rd too. I'm able to reply about 2 times a day AT LEAST, but it can go up to 5 or 6 times, most of the time at least 2 paragraphs. (Text me \"Slytherin\" to prove you read it all pleease)\nNow lastly to the type of character i like to play: I prefer playing bottoms since it comes natural to me. Also i like the feminin type of guy, but not in a way you don't even know it's a boy. And yes i like being short..\n\nSo for plots i am very flexible. As long as it does NOT include NSFW between minors, or the R word. Wait thats not plot. Well basically just the overall setting anything goes! From futuristic to ancient I like anything. The only thing you should not do is message me \"hey wanna roleplay\". \nWhat I prefer: \n\n-college roommates\n\n-Modern fantasy\n\n- hogwarts\n\n- star wars\n\n- any anime setting\n\nNow - love hearin' from ya'",

            "selftext": "  Good morning (It does depend on the timezone although),  \n   \n \n\nI currently already have several interesting stories going on with other writing partners on another medium. Yet, I am still lacking a specific story that has been crawling around in my mind for quite some time now. To be specific, it is a crossover between two universes. Those two universes would be The Witcher universe and the Elder Scrolls universe.   \n \n\nTo narrow it down timeline wise, it would be for The Witcher universe during or after the third game. As for the Elder Scrolls, it would be during the Three Banners War (Also known as the Elder Scrolls Online.)  \n \n\nSimply put, this is a conflict between the nine major races of the Elder Scrolls world that was masterminded by a certain creature (Which I intend to keep secret for the added fun). The creature intends to merge his own plane of existence with the one that is normally the world of Elder Scrolls. Yet, this procedure completely backfires during the Three Banners Wars and causes for the main continent (Tamriel) to end up transported wherever is enough space. For the convenience, somewhere in an ocean.  \n \n\nNow, with the continent moving over, the races and creatures also moved over. Yet, they did not all end up on Tamriel. I would say that a large portion of them did end up spread across the Witcher world as well. Which in turn could cause quite a bit of work for the Witchers with these new \"monsters\" I suppose. Also, given the whole war thing between the nine sentient races, I can see the more cunning ones using the new world that they landed in to further their own goals. So, more war.  \n \n\nMy character is a Bosmer (Wood Elf). Which means that he serves the Aldmeri Dominion. The details will follow in the story I would like to think. Anyway, he is a Dragonknight which means that he normally has a dragon as a mount. Yet, in a recent battle, his mount and partner was killed. Therefore he has only recently been bonded with a hatchling.  \n \n\nSo, the plot that I had in mind was that the entity who caused the whole crossover in the first place intends to drag both worlds towards his own plane of existence. Which means a heroic journey for our unlikely heroes with a lot of danger across the way.  \n \n\nAs for the character that I am looking for? It can be either a male or a female Witcher. (I am well aware that female Witchers are not really a thing but I have already added several artistic liberties anyway). I am also open to someone using Geralt. Romance is possible but not mandatory.   \n \n\nThere is no need for any understanding or knowledge about the Elder Scrolls universe at the start. After all, the character would also be completely unaware of these new monsters and races.   \n \n\nAs for my writing style? I tend to stick to posts around 500 to 1000 words on average. I normally do also mirror my partner in writing length. English is not my first language so that does tend to result in some minor grammar faults and spelling mistakes. I am more than willing to provide a writing sample in a DM.\n\nI am looking forward to a reaction.   \n \n\nWith kind regards,   \nJetteKlijnsma",

Cyberpunk on console and Pc has a lot of optimization issues, but that doesn\u2019t mean the story isn\u2019t amazing! Playing it through has me extremely excited to try out a roleplay based around Night City. \n\nI was hoping to create a longterm story with someone who thought this idea to be interesting or also had this day excitement that I did. You don\u2019t need to have played the game, you don\u2019t even need to know much about the world. I\u2019m happy to explain it and answer any questions you may have. \n\nI\u2019m in the midsts of creating my own OC. You can either send me yours in a message or we can help make yours together. \n\n**Rules for my partner**\n\n* You must be over 18, I\u2019m just not entirely comfortable roleplaying with someone younger than that \n\n*You must enjoy creating plot ideas\n\nSend me a Dm or chat, hope to hear from you soon.",

            "selftext": "hi there i am fairly new to this subreddit so please excuse me if i make any mistakes.\n\nI'm looking for a partner who is interested in a long term roleplay set in the multiverse of the fantasy card game  known as \"magic the gathering\". I aim to make it a long term roleplay with many aspects of exploration of both new worlds as well of worlds reborn. Since the roleplay is set in a multiverse does this leave alot of room open for many ideas you might want to try out.Even if you don't know the lore of magic could this be a interesting fantasy roleplay about travelling between worlds of wonders and new possibilities.\n\nAbout the theme of the roleplay for those who are not familiar with the tabletop game. Like i explained before is the roleplay set in a multiverse where many worlds known as planes are seperated from eachother by the blind eternities. Just as how difficult it is for us in the real world to travel to space, is it near impossible for the inhabitants to leave their plane. But there are very few who are born with a spark, nobody knows for sure what a spark is buh those who are born with it can travel between worlds once their spark is ignited by a strong emotion. Once ignited has the person ascended to a planeswalker, one of the very few beings able to travel between worlds\n\nI prefer to roleplay on discord and i have a fair share of free time during the week and week-ends.  About the lenght, do i prefer to be semi-lit but detailed if possible and in the third person.\n\nSo if this post caught your attentaion don't be shy to message me to discuss a possible plot or for my discord\n\nGood look hunting",

I'm in my early 20s and am a more.. masculine leaning nonbinary person, so I like he/they pronouns exclusively. I've been roleplaying for a good several years. My writing level, I would put at literate I guess. I'm by no means capable of novella but I like writing enough to give a good 2-5 paragraphs. 3rd person only. I primarily roleplay cis guys, trans guys, and nonbinary people and generally prefer MxM or MxNB roleplays. Or NBxNB! \n\nI like my roleplays to have romance in them, but as well as that I like a good modern fantasy, supernatural, or slice of life roleplay. I am 18+ and thus don't wish to roleplay with anyone under 18 or play/ship characters who are under 18. I don't have any solid plot ideas as of yet, but I'm more than happy to hear out your ideas or come up with some together. \n\nIf interested, please send me a message telling me a bit about you, and if you have plots go ahead and message me those too! I can't wait to hear from you! Also, if we talked or you messaged me and I didn't reply, feel free to send another message. I likely got overwhelmed, forgot, or Reddit forgot to notify me and thus I never got your message.",

            "selftext": "Hello Reddit! I've been a casual roleplayer for the past year, who's itching to write a good story (ideally in the fantasy genre.) A few things worth knowing about me is that I'm 19 years old, a freshman in college, and I live in the EST time zone. I absolutely love Dungeons &amp; dragons, drawing, and creative writing. I do digital art art on the side (and ideally I'll get an Illustration degree). \n\nWhat I mostly draw are character designs and fantasy concepts, so who knows, maybe if I get really inspired from whatever we write, I'll sketch something! :)\n\nHere are the qualities I'm seeking in a partner:  \n\n\n* Willing to use Discord!\n* Someone who also loves original writing sorry fandom RPers!)\n* Someone who loves the Fantasy, Slice of Life, Adventure genres (and maybe superhero/sci-fi if I'm feeling spicy)\n* Fantasy worldbuilding\n* Character dynamics (whether it's romantic, platonic, familial, etc.)\n* Romance (FxF, FxM, MxM, anything is fine with me as long as I think the characters match)\n* Character development and relationships in general. As much as I appreciate writing the plot and worldbuilding, what matters to me above all is a story about people. \n* Talking OOC/being friends is a must. I don't want roleplay to be a business transaction, I want it to feel comfortable and fun!\n\nIf you need more details or an idea of what exactly I'd like to write and roleplay, here's a few of them:\n\n*  A dark fantasy tale where you are a traveller/adventurer/hero who gets lost in a haunted land. You bump into one of my OCs, and we both do our best to survive and navigate the dark woods while trying to gain each other's trust.\n* A classic Best Friends to Rivals to Lovers story. We are childhood friends who have grown alongside each other (whether we lived in the same village, grew up in a Paladin Order, or just two orphans who had each other's back). At some point, we had a falling out because of a clash of ideals and opinions. Now, in the present day, we are on opposite sides of a conflict - therefore, we are enemies (despite our residual/blossoming/remaining feelings).\n* A fantasy story about gods (ideally we would worldbuild our own patheon). It could be about the downfall of a god, a tragic romance between two gods, or a rivarly between two gods.\n\nIf anything above calls out to you, please don't hesitate to leave a comment or DM me! :D",

            "selftext": "Heyo! I'm looking for a long-term dedicated partner who would like to roleplay Super Junior's Kyuhyun or BTS' Namjoon (RM).\n\n**Basics:**\n\n* Third person/past tense style. I\u2019d prefer if my partner uses it as well.\n* I don\u2019t do one liners/one paragraph, I like something around 2+ paragraphs. It can be long or short, I can do either. And I will always give you something to reply to. I really like multipara and details in the replies though.\n* I really don\u2019t mind your timezone, we can definitely work something out. I\u2019m CST right now, but I can reply whenever you\u2019re on.\n* I would love to find a partner who can reply at least once a week.\n* As for mature themes, I can write them since I\u2019m 21+. But I\u2019m fine with implying it or fade to black, anything you\u2019re comfortable with. I\u2019d prefer my partner to be 18+.\n* I love discussing and plotting together, it\u2019s awesome when we both decide and have ideas. I want it to be our plot, not just mine. I\u2019d love to have a partner who\u2019s as excited and has ideas for it.\n* I love fluff, but I happen to love angst a well, so a healthy amount of those would be great. Like gut-clenching, heart-melting romance is the best.\n* I like adding NPCs to make the threads/plot more interesting when needed, but I prefer keeping the main focus on one pairing. I am also open to all the AUs and verses.\n* I\u2019m looking for someone who has knowledge of Kyuhyun\u2019s/Namjoon's life and career, as well Suju/BTS and its members. It doesn\u2019t matter if you have never written either of them before, as long you want to try and are excited about the plot, then it\u2019s all good!\n* Listen, I get super into my plots and I have wanted this for so long, so I\u2019ll end up making gifsets and graphics and manips and everything you can imagine, just watch me. I\u2019ll spoil you like you have no idea.\n* I\u2019d love this to be on discord or email.\n\n**Plot:**\n\n* She\u2019s a popular British actress (bio will be shared when contacted), and he\u2019s a very popular kpop idol; they meet by coincidence (we can discuss it, open to any ideas) and they just click. So they start dating in secret, traveling across the world to see each other. Something super cute and sweet, a bicultural couple that learns about each other and they\u2019re just very happy even though it\u2019s not easy, literal soulmates that managed to meet. I\u2019d love it to be long-term, like them dating, dealing with fame and things, and just being in love.\n\n**Extras:**\n\n* I would give you all the cookies in the world if you write Kyuhyun or Namjoon (you would become my best friend).\n* This plot will include both scene and texting threads.\n* There will be no language barrier, she speaks Korean. It will be explained in detail in bio.\n* Open to discuss the possibility of doing it with any other Suju/BTS member, but Kyuhyun or Namjoon are my first choice.\n\n*If you\u2019re interested or have any questions, please feel free to message me via* ***PM***! I\u2019m really chill and I\u2019m always open to discuss anything, so don\u2019t be nervous about it.",

            "selftext": "Hey there! I go by the name echo and I am 17 years old (18 shortly!) RPer! I am semi literate-literate and I love history based plots!\n\nCurrently I am looking to use one character in particular of mine, his name is Vincent MacN\u00e8il! He is a World War One based character and was a soldier during the Great War. The plot I would most like to use is this:\\*\n\nY/C is a German medic (or just a medic) my character, Vincent, has been injured and is left bleeding out in the middle of an mostly abandoned no man\u2019s land. (Injury varies although i\u2019d prefer something a little dramatic etc) will your character save the others life, although Vincent is British? And.. if so- do they become friends? Or lovers, even.\n\nEven though this is the plot I would most like to use I have a few others and I am happy to send them in a PM or come up with plots together! I prefer the plot to be set at the end of the war (or near it) or completely after the war.\n\nI prefer MlM (bxb) relationships- I find them easier!\n\nHere is Vincent\u2019s character info: Vincent grew up in Scotland on a tiny, very quiet and isolated island called Iona. ( as he calls it, \u00cc Chaluim Chille)  \nHe grew up speaking Gaelic (he can\u2019t read or write in English, fun fact lmao) he left home, and ended up renting a farm at about the age of 16 which he worked at, and loved until the age 19 where he immediately enlisted into the British army, into the highland light infantry and off to France he went. He enjoys art, it\u2019s a pastime of his and he always has some sort of small book shoved haphazardly into his uniform and a pencil, which is usually actually stolen from someone else.\n\nHe is very cheery and light hearted, it\u2019s a little put on because he is trying to keep spirits up as well as cheer up those around him. He is cheeky and not very smart.\n\nHe is about 5\u20194, he is slim, Perhaps more on the underweight side of the scale, although he still is fairly strong from working at a farm for his whole life. He is very, very pale with bright blue eyes and freckles splattered across his nose and cheeks ( which usually are flushed somehow) mostly- although he has some more dotted elsewhere where. He had chin length curly dark brown hair, which is usually tied up haphazardly at the back of his head.",

            "selftext": "In 2115 a group of rebels introduced their secret weapon that would turn the tide of the war, genetically enhanced super soldiers. The called them Specials, and they were far stronger, faster, and smarter, small groups of these soliders could take out entire battalions of government soldiers. The only problem was, they were teenagers. And while these soldiers eventually won the war and helped to topple the monarchy, it came at a severe cost to their psyches. Now, three years after the end of the war, many of these former child soldiers suffer from PTSD, severe anxiety, and aggressiveness. And when many times when the police are brought in to deal with these situations, they end up killing the former soldiers since they pose an such an extreme threat. And the public has grown scared of the remaining Specials, and so many people wouldn\u2019t hire Specials. So they ended up on the streets with no help coming from the people they had fought so hard to put into power. The government had distanced themselves entirely from the Specials, trying to cover up their involvement in the creation of super soldiers. \n\nWe will be roleplaying two of those specials, message me if you are interested. As far as detail goes, try to write a paragraph or two. I prefer to roleplay on discord, but am okay with doing it on kik.",

            "selftext": " \n\nHey there! Call me Aiden :D\n\nAs you can guess from the title, I'm in search of a roleplay featuring the classic Greek Mythology Gods and Goddesses, both in a modern and ancient setting. I have a few ideas of my own that I'd love to try out, but of course you can tell me what ideas you have and we can mix and match. Communication's the key!\n\n* (Modern) The Titans have returned. The gods go against them once more, in an effort to defeat them, and figure out why exactly they are back. But, during the battle, hidden evils conspire against them and they end up on Earth with no memory of how they got there. Or who they are..\n\n* (Modern) In an effort to better understand the mortals, some of the gods head on down to Earth and rent an apartment together! Surely no shenanigans ensue.\n\n* (Ancient) There was a prophecy that told of the upcoming fall of Zeus. Hera, tired of being ordered around by him, gathers a couple of other gods who feel the same way in an attempt to take him down and fulfill the prophecy. Meanwhile, Zeus is taking precautions.\n\n* (Ancient) Ever wonder how Apollo, Artemis, Hermes and Dionysus got to be on Olympus although they are bastard children of Zeus? The rest of the gods sure do. They're not happy being treated as equals to them, and decided to finally do something about it.\n\n(!) These are all the plots I have myself. I'd prefer if we could focus on the Olympians (with some exceptions if you like for Hypnos or Eros or someone similar) and, most preferably, we'd use Hermes in some way. He's my favourite God, to no one's surprise if you see my profile picture, and I'd love if we could use him somehow.\n\nNow that the fun part's out of the way, here's my roleplaying information:\n\n* **3rd person, long paragraphs only!** I consider myself literate and use lots of details, so I'd love if we were on the same literary level. I write more or less 500 words, with the exception of dialogue obviously.\n\n* **Please don't be a ghost!** If the roleplay's not working out for you, I get it, I've been there! Please just let me know and don't leave me in the dark- I won't take it personally.\n\n* **No limits!** Dark themes are a-okay with me, though do remember to tell me about any limits you might have. Not everyone is comfortable with everything. NSFW is off the table though.\n\n* **Discord only!** None negotiable. Sorry :P\n\nThat's about it, I believe. I don't want to make this post too long lol. Do include your favourite god/deity in your message, so I know you have read the whole thing. Also please try to include some things about yourself in your message or perhaps what you would want out of this roleplay- Be creative! Don't start with a blunt \"hi.\"\n\nEither way, thanks for reading!! Hope to hear from you soon!",

            "selftext": "Hey there! I hope you\u2019re all enjoying your days! Today I\u2019m currently looking for a new partner to do a literate romance based in an older Ninja Turtle universe after a dear partner disappeared. In terms of style, I\u2019m going for the 2012 designs, but we can definitely discuss setting, scenario and character details to fit our needs! This will involve you playing a canon character for one of my original characters. I am happy to double if needed as well, and we can have two separate roleplays going for whatever you\u2019re interested in doing in this fandom universe! I\u2019m also interested in the punk turtle designs by Sirconcon and would be open to discussing something there! This is rather vague I\u2019m aware, however I really want us to build something tailored to our wants and needs! So if you\u2019re interested in a literate, plot-driven romance with some older crime fighting turtles, you\u2019ve come to the right place! \n\nRules \n\n1. Please be a literate, 3rd person player. You do not need to write a novel, however sentence/paragraph structure are a huge must for me. No text talk or improper punctuation.\n2. Please be active overall. I understand we have lives, however, if you are the type to disappear/ghost, I am not for you. I want us to keep a steady stream going so things do not get stale! If you do need to leave, please just communicate.\n3. This will be romance and plot focused. Get ready to write something wonderful together! \n4. Because the characters are all going to be 21+ here, I am asking that you also be at least 21 years old yourself. \n5. Please be okay with MxM romantic pairings. If you request a double, I can do MxF or MxM for you. \n\nIf interested, feel free to PM me! Thank you so much for reading, and have a wonderful day!",

            "selftext": "Hi all! I'll be typing this as from my phone, so please excuse any issues.\n\nI recently finished the story of Cyberpunk 2077 and, despite the game's issues, I need more of that setting! Frankly, if I could inject all of the aesthetics and ambience directly into my veins, that'd be an easier go of it but I'll have to settle with telling some stories instead!\n\nI write exclusively as a DM. My aim is to bring a world to life with memorable and original characters, matched with a deep and compelling story. I put a lot of effort into my story telling and I don't feel that I can reach my potential with typical 1-on-1 partnerships. So, with that being said, I'm searching for one female partner (preferably with a female character) to explore Night City with my cast!\n\nNaturally, all of the characters here will be original.\n\nAdditionally, I'm not trying to re-create a story similar to the game. I'm not necessarily seeking action! Even if our story is primarily drama and charactet development, I'll enjoy it just as much. Here are some starting plot ideas:\n\n* Gang Setting: Your character is a prospective member of one of the many gangs of Night City.\n* Corporate Paradise: Your character is a low, but respectable, Corpo. But how will they fare when they're forced into the dirty streets of Night City?\n* Nomad: You're not from Night City, but it was the only logical place to go. After spending your life on so many bad roads, you've learned that they all lead to Night City.\n* Civilian: Civilian, non-combatant, and peasant are all names that you have been called. Still, anyone can become a Legend in Night City.\n* Prison: You've just served five years in prison for a crime you didn't commit. Now with two days between you and freedom, you're not sure you'll survive to breath the fresh smog of Night City.\n\nAs a DM, I encourage a sense of danger within our story. I'll never seek to permanently harm/kill your character! However, consequences do add a real sense of joy to the story for my past partners and myself. We can discuss this more if you're interested!\n\nFinally, due to the setting and themes of Cyberpunk, I would prefer my partner to be 18+. \n\nIf you're interested, please let me know!",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone. It has been a while since I really jumped in head first to role playing, but I am looking to get back in the game. Through OOC chat I have made some lasting and interesting friendships with previous roleplay partners, and I hope to find that sort of connection again. I tend to role play slice-of-life romantic type RPs, and I have recently become fascinated with non-typical pairings. Pairings and relationships that are a bit unorthodox or out of the ordinary. I have a list of those pairings below. I thought about adding a bit more ideas to each pairing, but I think those smaller details are what we work out through our writing. I tend to not do face claims, but can, and I like to write in 3rd person with 18+ just in case adult themes come into play. Also be warned, if I get into the RP I can write some replies of pretty decent length. \n\n* Two strangers at a Wedding Reception\n* An Escort and her client\n* Two people who survive a plane crash on an isolated island\n* Two people getting stuck in an elevator\n* A desk clerk at a hotel and a regular patron\n* A flight attendant and pilot or regular flyer\n* A stranger pretending to be someone elses fiance\n* Strangers who always end up traveling together (like on a train)\n* A random dinner between two strangers, that ends up being a professor/college student pairing\n* An uber driver/taxi driver and a long distance partner\n* Two strangers, but one becomes pregnant\n\nYou may be able to tell that some of these pairings are taken from various movies or TV shows. Again, I wanted to leave them open for us working them out together.",
