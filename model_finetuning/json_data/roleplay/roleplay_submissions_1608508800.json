I am looking for a detailed roleplay where I would play an older harry after the books/movies wrap up and want to explore how he would be and what mindset he would have. You can play a canon or OC character of your choosing. Other things can be included but inside of the plot which will come first. This is my main idea but am up for many other fandoms or even slice of life or any ideas you would love to try. I am open to mamy different roleplay ideas so just message me with your thoughts and we can discuss something of interest to both of us. I roleplay on kik (jman68001) as well as discord just ask.

Thanks for taking a look at my advertisement!\n\nMy name's Kyle, I'm 20, English and I'm currently looking for some RP partners to write some cool and original stories! Before I say about what I like to roleplay, allow me to introduce myself and my likes.\n\n\u2022 I'm currently 20, so I'm looking for someone 18+. Simple enough reasoning.\n\n\u2022 I'm currently only looking for female RP Partners playing a female OC. I do apologize if this doesn't include yourself. It's just my personal preference.\n\n\u2022 I, please, ask that anyone who RPs with me is somewhat frequent. A post a day is just something that just isn't entertaining to me and my interest will quickly drop. If you're going to be too busy or otherwise occupied on some days, please tell me.\n\n\u2022 I like a partner who's detailed and experienced. Fine, quickfire posts can be shorter, but I like quality in my posts. Also, I RP in THIRD person only. Again, just my preference. I also play OC Characters only as well. I don't find it entertaining to play a Canon Character. My secret word is Delta. Please use this in your message at some point so I know you're reading all of my post.\n\n\u2022 Finally, I like people who are interested in the same things as myself. Please understand what my RP is being based on.\n\nRight! Now I have my expectations out of the way, here are the things I'm looking for to RP!\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------  \n\u2022 DC: For this, I'm primarily looking for a sort of AU mashup of the Young Justice and Batman: Bad Blood universe. New 52 but with an expansive cast of characters. I have my own OC centered around the Bat-Family and I'd like my partner to have a character that's OC and has her ties but is also her own unique character. I'm looking for something more than just another Supergirl or Zatanna. Something unique and interesting, please. I ask that you have at least seen the three Batman movies being Son of Batman, Batman vs Robin, and Batman: Bad Blood. Extra props if you've seen Young Justice too.   \n\\---------------------------------------------------\n\nI can safely say I will try my utmost hardest to respond to all chat requests and messages as soon as I possibly can, even if it's to say that we're not fit to be RP partners, although this depends on how many I do get. c:\n\nI hope you all enjoyed what I've produced and I hope that I get some responses fairly soon! Thanks again for taking the time to read my post! See you soon!",

And also no, I'm not a furry.\n\nThe general concept of this roleplay would be a OCxOC romance story taking place in the general area of the game. Perhaps Bright Harbor or we make up our own little town, it's all up to you! This roleplay mostly would be slice of life, we can build a main story too. I want to be clear and say that I want to keep this as close to the game as possible, that means no tails, no boobs, crazy furry characters or anything like that. Basically keep it in the artstyle, imagine the roleplay as if you were playing a DLC or something. Sexual references, swearing and all that heavy adult stuff will be present of course and I just don't want to roleplay with minors. Literate, lengthy and detailed responses are a must too. I have a OC already planned, and I expect that we would both play as multiple side characters as well. That really should be it, I only roleplay on Discord so if you're interested shoot me a PM and I'll most likely respond and hand you my tag! Peace for now!",

I have not had much luck on Dreamwidth with that so here I am. I mostly journal rp, but I'm not averse to switching to discord or google docs. I'm just looking for someone to write with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Who I play:*\n\nJin Guangyao (Meng Yao), Nie Huiasang, Lan Wangji and Xiao Xingchen for now.\n\n(My kingdom or someone to write Jin Guangyao with particularly Lan Xichen or the Nie brothers.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*What I write like:*\n\nI write long form. I can do the bracket thing if needed. Switching is not really a problem. I am more concerned about the effort than format. I tend to reply with at least a paragraph of text. I'm not a fan of one line rp and won't do it. It's just not my cup of tea. \n\n*Availability:* \n\nI'm pretty flexible, honestly. As long as it's not taking two weeks or more to progress forward. I don't expect you to be bonded to your computer. I know I won't be. But, if a month passes and I'm not heard a peep from you, it's hard to jump back into writing something I haven't thought about in weeks. I'm central time zone.\n\n*What I'm looking for:*\n\nRpers in their 20's and up. No offense, but I'm old. I don't feel comfortable writing with teenagers. \n\nNo OCs. I'm only interested in writing with fandom characters right now.\n\nAUs that take place in the same world, but diverge from the given story are totally my jam. I'm all about 'but what if this happened instead?' scenarios.\n\nShipping is okay with me, though I'm not a fan of slice of life stuff\n\nNot against romance plots in rp so long as there is CR and plot.",

            "selftext": "Hello there everybody! So, as the title says ,I'm looking for someone interested in roleplaying any of these select fandoms. Originals are welcome too! I like romantic slice of life stuff the most,especially if its Christmas themed due to the holidays coming up.\n\nI prefer to rp 3rd person and at least 2 paragraphs or more.Plus a decent grasp on grammar and punctuation. I've been roleplaying for 10+ years so I have a lot of experience.  I try to respond once a day but it may take me longer to reply sometimes as I have a full time job,family, pets etc .I also get depression and anxiety so sometimes that plays a role as well. Please don't spam asking me for replies as that only makes me anxious.  Be patient that's all I ask. I like well thought out and literate replies. Put thought,love, and care into your response and honestly length won't be that big of an issue. \n\nDiscord or email is preferred. \n\n I usually rp MxF pairings and adult themes are fine as long as you and the characters involved are 18+ this is a strict rule!\n\n I also LOVE  to OOC chat so don't be shy! I really enjoy talking with others like plotting and just getting to know each other. Best part of roleplaying is making friends!\n\nThese are the fandoms and in parentheses are my preferred love interests. These are OCx Canon!  : \n\nProdgical Son((Martin Whitly))\n\nStar Wars ((Dryden Vos))\n\nGood Omens(( Aziraphale)) \n\nUmbrella Academy ((This will be OC x OC))\n\nLucifer((Lucifer))\n\n The Boys(( Billy Butcher))\n\nBioshock (( Robert Lutece))\n\nBirds of Prey((  Roman))\n\n Harry Potter Marauder Era(( Remus))\n\nAvengers((Vision)) I have an AU idea for this!\n\nWitcher (( Jaskier))\n\nWolf Among Us/Fables(( Bigby OR looking for someone to play an OC I created against an OC of mine))\n\nI do originals as well so we can discuss prompts!\n\nHave a great day!",

But, I understand if you may be busy with work, school, etc. I'm a very patient person. Though, if you don't reply in 3 days to a week, I will send a quick little hello to check on you.\n\nI roleplay on Discord, Deviantart, and Quotev, so let me know if you have any of those things.\n\nI prefer to roleplay description, with the lines up to 2-3 lines minimal to 6 lines max. I don't have the best grammar, and I can understand if you are the same, but no stuff like text talk, unless the character is actually texting.\n\nI roleplay with an oc, but I like to roleplay as other characters that are part of the show as well just as side characters. So I would like my partner to be the same way. If you don't have an oc, that is totally fine.\n\n**NOTE**: I do allow doubling!\n\nAlso, please let me know if anything bothers you. I am very flexible, and can roll with most things. However, I can tell if you won't be able to roleplay with me anymore. I've had many before do that.",

            "selftext": "I\u2019ll try and keep this short and sweet! Looking for a **The Magicians** roleplay:\n\n\u2022 Canon x Canon, no OC's\n\n\u2022 Eliot Waugh &amp; Quentin Coldwater - I am comfortable playing either character.\n\n\u2022 Want to build off the plots from the show, but take it our own way. I'd love to dabble in plots in both Brakebills &amp; Fillory, creating a complex plot is my favorite thing.\n\n\u2022 I\u2019m comfortable playing side characters of any gender, so long as you are too. Anyone we need to progress the plot I don't mind picking up.\n\n\u2022 I love writing magic, lets get silly with it. Interested in writing it's drawbacks and flaws too.\n\n\u2022 Darker themes desired but not necessary.\n\n\u2022 I can write fade to black or more.\n\n\u2022 Bunch of plot suggestions below, feel free to mix them up or include your own!\n\n\\---\n\nTimeline 41\n\nMaybe Marina was right? The convergence was going to be powerful, possibly enough to bring the people they loved back, at the cost of messing everything else up. Q is reanimated to discover their world is ending and he doesn\u2019t come in one piece. He\u2019s missing his shade. Can\u2019t be all that bad to live through an apocalypse, right? They still have Fillory and the Library at their disposal, after all, if they can find a way to get back with everything shut down. There\u2019s also the pesky problem of causing a rift between friends after deciding not to move the moon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTimeline 42\n\nAs the monsters overrun the library, the team are able to save Eliot, but Julia\u2019s body is nowhere to be found. They have the scroll and a way to get rid of one of the monsters once and for all. They just need to act fast before the missing sibling comes to resolve their plans herself. There\u2019s no way any of them would be making it out alive. Back in Fillory, no time jump has happened and Acting High King Fen is still waiting on Margo\u2019s return, the dark king is an impending threat, along with plenty of other problems such as the magical surges coming to the surface and affecting multiple worlds. Plenty of broken parts need tending to. Eliot had rejected Q in their last heart to heart, and while he\u2019d promised to bring it up again as soon as he\u2019s out, life had other plans. Q and Alice seem to be a thing again, should he go mess that good thing up for his own benefit?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTimeline 43\n\nEliot or Q are the first to break the personality and rediscover they\u2019re magicians. Giving them a small break to catch their breath. Finding the others is a whole new task in itself while the monster is hunting them. Which one of their friends might it inhabit? Playing dad to a psychotic god-tiered toddler sounds terrifying, they\u2019re running out of time and plans.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTimeline 44\n\nA brown hare appears on the table as Q stirs from a nap on the couch. A messenger, knowing immediately he sits up to regather his bearings. The rabbit wheezed as though a 50-pack-a-day habit had caught up to it. \u201cNeed help. Love Eliot.\u201d Q best go find out what was going on. Eliot has learned in Fillory, that the High King could have both a wife and husband. He married for the job once, he doesn\u2019t have to do that again. Cue award-winning awkwardly adorable conversation?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTimeline 45\n\nWithout magic, Quentin ended back up in a mental hospital. Eliot visited, and we can always touch on that in flashbacks, but he was also waiting there at the doors when Q was released. Someone needs to distract the sad sap and Eliot has just the thing. Magic doesn\u2019t solve too many problems, but even without it he can put on a show. Who doesn't like fireworks and a little team effort?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTimeline 46\n\nWhile the monster was hunting the group, it had found and killed Brian first. When it finally hopped into Eliot's body, Q had somehow held onto its subconscious and now needs to help Eliot stay alive and more or less sane in his own subconscious. At least until he lets his friends know he's still in there and they find a way to fix this mess. Quentin will also get to see Eliot's deepest fear which was rejecting Q, so thats going to be \\*super\\*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTimeline 47\n\nWith Christmas right around the corner, let's do something festive. Come help see how far present wrapping can go before too many drinks are had. Let's end up in some horrific festive realm that's been long abandoned without good old Saint Nick there to fix it? Maybe they could try and hunt him down to help them. Eliot and Q really don't need to be kings of anywhere else... but let's fix this world, just this one time! Swear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTimeline 48\n\nFillory has turned to the dark side, and the group has been trying to find their angle so they can take back the reign. Eliot doesn't feel like he can be the one to take out the Dark King. Unbeknownst to Q, the others are off doing their shenanigans and trying to keep him in the dark about it. Margo found a fix and Eliot thought it was simply alcohol, how wrong he turned out to be. Only a teeny tiny problem; if they ever admit they aren't who they say they are, they'll be stuck in these switched bodies forever. Freaky friday nonsense!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTimeline 49\n\nThey finally did create the new world for all Fillorians, disconnecting themselves from their friends in order to perform the spell. Let\u2019s build up the new world order one crazy problem at a time, all while dealing with finding that connection to Earth, if there ever is one.\n\n\\---\n\nThings you probably want to know about me;\n\n\u2022 I lied when I said I was keeping this short, sorry.\n\n\u2022 I\u2019m 28 and searching for other writers of similar age.\n\n\u2022 I\u2019m a relaxed paced writer, so timezones don\u2019t matter much to me (EST if you\u2019re curious).\n\n\u2022 I write 1-3 paragraphs, 3rd person, usually. Shorter posts are faster for me, but sometimes I have a lot of word vomit to share too. You know how it goes.\n\n\u2022 We can exchange brainstorming sessions for our characters/story any day.\n\n\u2022 I roleplay on Reddit messages or discord, emails are okay for me too.",

            "selftext": "I have been having such an itch to have a roleplay where Hawks is just :chefskiss: \n\nNow to clarify, Fandom Hawks literally just means how he is depicted usually through the Fandom. It's not strictly Canon and all that jazz, that way there is a little more freedom in roleplaying a Canon character. I'm looking for someone to play him. \n\nMy idea for the plot of this is that my character is likely going to be doing heroics, and maybe Hawks runs into her somehow? Saves her from something? Swoops in to help? Many possibilities. \n\nI will be asking for a writing sample, and I'll know that you guys will actually do it if you read this far and want to genuinely roleplay :) All I ask is for you to write how you'd emote to start the roleplay. Or, an emote just regarding this roleplay, could be already doing something. Whatever is easiest! \n\nI do have preferences for my rp partners. I would like decent grammar and punctuation and all that jazz. You also don't have to be a novella, in fact that drives me away. I don't like reading walls of text, I feel lost and overwhelmed. 1-2 small paras is fine, enough to keep the flow going in the roleplay. \n\nAs for me. I write in 3rd person and I typically write 1 para, sometimes 2. I am in the EST, I'm a huge night owl. My preferred platform to rp is on Discord! I hope to hear from ya :)",

            "selftext": "All characters are 18+!!!!\n\n(A worn-out idea, I know, but what can I do. I am a sucker for a good Cold War roleplay)\n\nAnyway, hello there, good people!\n\nI hope you all are doing fine on this day. As you could have noticed from the title, it's a spy romance between the American CIA and Soviet KGB agents I am looking for. I don't mind playing any of the two, although I would like to try playing a Soviet. However, if you have a wish to play an OC that is Soviet or any particular and specific role, let me know, it's no problem!\n\nI am going to keep it simple with the plot, for now, I will give more detail in the messages. The idea was for this to start neither in America nor the USSR. My personal idea was for this to start in Greece, the year 1982. Since Greece joined NATO in 1952, the son of one of the prominent political figures among the Allied forces went on a holiday to Athens. You were among the Secret Service's best agents hired to guard him and keep track of him, while I was among the best KGB's agent, sent on a mission to spy him and take him out. However, our two characters do not know each other's presence. From this part on, I am not sure how characters should meet. I wouldn't want them knowing about each other's real jobs yet, maybe, the two could sabotage each other in Greece for now, unknowingly doing so, as he is not aware she is a CIA agent, nor is she aware he is a KGB agent (or vice versa, should you choose the KGB role). As the story progresses, I would like it to go any way you'd like. Maybe it goes on in Berlin, maybe she moves to USSR. Maybe he moves to the USA for a mission. Greece was a fling for them until their missions were over but later their paths cross again. How? We will decide!\n\nMore about me:\n\n\\-Third-Person Perspective Writing\n\n\\-Past Tense\n\n\\-I can adapt to any writing style (from one-liners to advanced writing, just give me an example of YOUR writing so I could adapt to it)\n\n\\-Not a frequent respondent (I can reply once or twice a day when it comes to multi-para writing, but I try my best to do more as I am busy with Uni right now)\n\n\\-Timezone UTC +1\n\n\\-I roleplay on Discord ONLY\n\n\\-For the character description, I can use either a written-up description or do a face claim, whatever you are more comfortable with, and I can even do a voice claim if you want the character to be more vivid.\n\nThat's all if you're interested, send me a message! Looking forward to your replies! c:",

I\u2019d like the rp to have romance in it, as it makes the story more interesting in my opinion. I would prefer to be an OC in all of these plots, but I can be convinced to be a canon character if you really to rp alongside one, though there are some I probably won\u2019t do because I don\u2019t know enough about the character. The fandoms I\u2019m interested in are:\n\nMarvel\n\nDC\n\nStar Wars (Any era)\n\nLord of the Rings\n\nLegend of Zelda (Mainly BOTW)\n\nWe can work out the plots together, as I\u2019m happy to hear what ideas you have. I\u2019d also be interested in doing a crossover of any of these fandoms, with one character moving over to the world of another. Otherwise, that\u2019s about it!

            "selftext": "Hey to all of you chooms,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Foreword -** \n\nI have completed the game 100 %, seen all of the endings, and played it through multiple perspectives and I will be openly talking about things that can be considered to be spoilers. You have been warned. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is very rare for me to feel so attached emotionally to a game/the world it's set in, but something in Cyberpunk 2077 just ticked the right boxes for me and I genuinely feel rather empty after completing all of it. The endings by themselves just sucker punch you in the feelings, one after another. So it's pretty safe to say that I am still suffering from post-series-depression and I figured that playing out a long-term story that is set in this world would help alleviate some of that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Description -** \n\nI'm Azun, 25 years old male from EU. I roleplay in a third-person, literate, multi-paragraph (2-6) style and I prefer you would do the same. Very experienced in multiple genres and styles of roleplay, no real limits on my writing but I am respectful towards my partners and their limits. That being said, it is pretty safe to expect mature themes in such a setting, especially when I am actively wishing to focus on the day-to-day aspect and romance that I felt the game itself didn't present with too much. I will only roleplay with those that are above the age of 18, no exceptions. I greatly prefer Discord as the platform, so be also prepared for just some casual, friendly bantering. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ideas -** \n\n1) While we don't really know what the DLC's will bring in their wake and if they will decide to touch the endings further, we could just agree on a singular ending and discuss what its effects would be on the Night City. Some of them don't really affect the city at all, while some of them affect nearly the whole world. After that, we would just create two OC's and throw them into Night City, somehow intertwine their story and take it from there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I was genuinely really touched by the dynamic of Panam and male V (from street kid origin) since it was rather clear that both of them were from different worlds and yet they beautifully found each other. Just too bad that the game never really showed this more clearly, but even in the ending questline it further pushed the Aldecaldos family aspect which really shadowed V's and Panam's connection. So I'd be wanting to remedy that by finding someone who would be willing to do a loyal portrayal of Panam and we'd discuss what sort of V you would find fitting to be the counterpart to that. This setting would also pick up from the ending, perhaps starting at their journey towards Arizona from Night City. (Which is located in Northern California.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3) Wildcard. Tell me about your idea('s) and let's see if we can figure out something that we would both enjoy writing. Or just stop by to chat about Cyberpunk 2077 and how it made you feel, I'm always up for a new angle and a new friendly face to banter with. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlright, that's all the deets for this gig. Time to delta out of this post and send me a nice PM, please include your favorite moment from the game. I don't respond to chat.",

I am semi literate-literate and I love history based plots!\n\nCurrently I am looking to use one character in particular of mine, his name is Vincent MacN\u00e8il! He is a World War One based character and was a soldier during the Great War. The plot I would most like to use is this:\\*\n\nY/C is a German medic (or just a medic) my character, Vincent, has been injured and is left bleeding out in the middle of an mostly abandoned no man\u2019s land. (Injury varies although i\u2019d prefer something a little dramatic etc) will your character save the others life, although Vincent is British? And.. if so- do they become friends? Or lovers, even.\n\nEven though this is the plot I would most like to use I have a few others and I am happy to send them in a PM or come up with plots together! I prefer the plot to be set at the end of the war (or near it) or completely after the war.\n\nI prefer MlM (bxb) relationships- I find them easier!\n\nHere is Vincent\u2019s character info: Vincent grew up in Scotland on a tiny, very quiet and isolated island called Iona. ( as he calls it, \u00cc Chaluim Chille)  \nHe grew up speaking Gaelic (he can\u2019t read or write in English, fun fact lmao) he left home, and ended up renting a farm at about the age of 16 which he worked at, and loved until the age 19 where he immediately enlisted into the British army, into the highland light infantry and off to France he went. He enjoys art, it\u2019s a pastime of his and he always has some sort of small book shoved haphazardly into his uniform and a pencil, which is usually actually stolen from someone else.\n\nHe is very cheery and light hearted, it\u2019s a little put on because he is trying to keep spirits up as well as cheer up those around him. He is cheeky and not very smart.\n\nHe is about 5\u20194, he is slim, Perhaps more on the underweight side of the scale, although he still is fairly strong from working at a farm for his whole life. He is very, very pale with bright blue eyes and freckles splattered across his nose and cheeks ( which usually are flushed somehow) mostly- although he has some more dotted elsewhere where. He had chin length curly dark brown hair, which is usually tied up haphazardly at the back of his head.",

You'd been unceremoniously dumped by boyfriend; this was my first without my late wife. The day itself was stressful, me at my parents' place, you at your sister's with her family. \n\nWe're old friends and since we met accidentally last week for a drink after so many years, we've been texting incessantly. After a terrible Christmas day, we agree to meet in the local pub. We have a few drinks and things go well... Very well. A perfect end to a perfect Christmas. I text you the next day. We live in different cities but I'd love to see if this can work. I have feelings for you. You do too. \n\nAgain we're alone at New Year but not really alone. We facetime and spend almost all night on our phones to the chagrin of our friends. Every weekend in January, one or the other of us visits the other. It's romantic and easy and I'm falling in love. Maybe Valentine's, I'll tell you that. \n\nIn a restaurant, I bought you roses. The music plays. I'm going to say it. I clear my throat and smile. You love as nervous as I feel. 'I lo.....'. You talk over me....'I'm pregnant'.\n\nI do first or third person, prefer Discord. Pm me",

That as it is, I have recently found myself in a demand to Roleplay, and yet I have no supply. So, I figured today would be a good day to post an ad and catch me some RP buddies. I don't really care about your gender, at least for the idea I had in mind. I prefer to use Discord as a primary means of Roleplay, just because to me it appears cleaner and more organized the other means.\n\nA lot of what I'm generally interested in can be discussed between you and I, however I do not enjoy a lot of fantasy style RPs, which I know is kind of what everyone is into. I'm more into dark and gritty roleplays, focusing on the darker side of humanity or on more grim topics such as war, conflict, etc. For my writing style, I write primarily in third person and prefer my partner to do the same (as it makes it a lot less confusing.) I generally type responses on an \"as needed\" basis. This means that my responses can be anywhere from 1 line to 10 paragraphs. All dependent on what is properly needed to convey the feelings, or the scene that is being Roleplayed in.\n\nApologies for the short advertisement, and hey; If you found my ad enticing, please feel free to contact me.",

This RP would work better for those who have a lot of knowledge of UFC and the female fighters over there.\n\nMy prompt would be, you would play as a female fighter and I would be my own personal character, the two of us could be friends, a couple, married, anything like that, we can be flexible with it, and the story would be the two of us going through the life as MMA fighters and bonding over the struggles and hardships of the schedule being on the road so much of the year, taking the positive and negative parts of it together.\n\nAgain, a lot of this is flexible and we can discuss it in detail if you are interested, things such as which year it would be, who we would play as, story ideas, things like that. Just send me a message if you are interested in this idea, and we can go from there and discuss details. Thank you.",

I haven\u2019t really done something like this, but I wanted some representation, and some of you probably do too. \n\nThe idea is that your and my characters have been in the closet for a while, as they don\u2019t live in a very accepting town. They have been friends for a while now, and are just trying to get through their daily lives.\n\nRomance may pop up in this. If it does, I want it to be natural.\n\nThis one is most likely going to be dark at times. Just let me know what your triggers are so that I don\u2019t accidentally overstep.\n\nOnto the nitty gritty.\n\nSpecifications: I\u2019m semilit. I write one-three paragraphs, and I usually hit three in my starters. I write in first person, but can write in third person if need be.\n\nExpectations: I\u2019m looking for someone who can write at least two lines. As long as you try to match, I\u2019m fine. Have a decent grasp on grammar. Please try to catch mistakes before you post.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested, please send me a message. To make sure you read everything, please include the word tree in your message. \n\nThat\u2019s all from me! Have a good day/night!",

I'm not talking Hawaii or the Maldives, I'm more likely to get sent to Niger, Rwanda or the Solomon Islands.\n\nI specialise in helping to build hospitals, kitting them out and training the local people. I'd like you to play someone who works with me, maybe a doctor or a nurse. We've both had a horrible time recently and have signed up to six months in a really remote project in a very obscure, remote country. We meet a week or two before to do some training and get on.\n\nAfter flying out to the capital of the country we'll work in, we change to a tiny twin propeller plane. There's just us two, the pilot and a stranger. As we fly an hour, two hours over the sea to the final destination, the engines start to splutter. I look in your eyes and see fear.\n\nI wake up injured and still inside the plane. The flames threaten to engulf us. I'm able to carry you out just in time before the fusillage explodes, leaving no other survivors. It's just us. \n\nOver the next few weeks, we manage to survive, becoming closer. We wait in vain to be rescued. Eight months pass before a helicopter arrives. By then, I'm a lot more muscular. You are two but your stomach is a lot bigger with our first child. \n\nI'd love to play out our survival and our we react to our pregnancy and the subsequent events. Over 18s only",

            "selftext": "Hello all, I go by Jam. I\u2019ve been roleplaying for quite a long time and I\u2019m still looking for another creative individual.  I\u2019ve written many genres over the years, and have had the pleasure of doing so with a select group of people that I mesh well with. I also admit I\u2019m picky about writing partners. I value someone that I can not only write well with, but forge a friendship with as well. Sought after skills I look for in a partner is someone who wants long-term, enjoys world building, character development, and story development.\n\nMy posting style leans more on the novella side. I usually shoot for multiple paragraphs, but I also take into account what\u2019s going on in the storyline, as well as my partner\u2019s style of writing. Above all, quality over quantity, but I tend to prefer both. Correct spelling, decent punctuation and grammar are a necessity. Mistakes happen, and I certainly make them, but we should be able to understand what we\u2019re writing to each other.\n\nIn terms of communication, I like to talk and plot put of character over discord. My three methods of RP posting are google docs, email, or proboards. My favorite method is proboards because it\u2019s easier to get to for me over any device, at any location. I have created one specifically for RP, and it\u2019s both safe and anonymous for those I bring in to use it. This is more like an ease of access thing, than it is preference. However, I'm pretty flexible about this.\n\nI\u2019ve listed the genres that interest me below. I also prefer using original characters. I put a great deal of emphasis in worldbuilding before the writing begins, and it serves as a beloved part of the process for me. I take pleasure in sharing a story, and not controlling it. Expectations should be a managed balance of storytelling between players. I\u2019m an adult and would also like my partner to be 21+ as mature themes are expected. Lastly, life comes first. I have a job that takes a great deal of my time and hope patience can be exercised when it comes to post frequency. I push to post daily and if I can\u2019t then expect that to be communicated. Now time for the good stuff.\n\nScience Fiction/Cyberpunk: Star Wars, Doom, Mass Effect, Final Fantasy, Aeon Trinity, Equilibrium, Matrix and other close works of sci-fi preferred.\n\nPost-Apocalyptic/Survival: The Division, War of the Worlds, Modern Outbreak/Contagion, or something of the like.\n\nModern Fantasy/Horror: Bright, Modern Tolkien, World of Darkness, Modern Gods, or something based off The Originals.\n\nMedieval Fantasy: Let's talk about this one.\n\nThese are just a few of the things floating in my mind to write, but if you have any suggestions for a plot all your own, I would love to hear it! Please shoot me a PM if you\u2019re interested. Thanks for reading!",

You'd been unceremoniously dumped by boyfriend; this was my first without my late wife. The day itself was stressful, me at my parents' place, you at your sister's with her family. \n\nWe're old friends and since we met accidentally last week for a drink after so many years, we've been texting incessantly. After a terrible Christmas day, we agree to meet in the local pub. We have a few drinks and things go well... Very well. A perfect end to a perfect Christmas. I text you the next day. We live in different cities but I'd love to see if this can work. I have feelings for you. You do too. \n\nAgain we're alone at New Year but not really alone. We facetime and spend almost all night on our phones to the chagrin of our friends. Every weekend in January, one or the other of us visits the other. It's romantic and easy and I'm falling in love. Maybe Valentine's, I'll tell you that. \n\nIn a restaurant, I bought you roses. The music plays. I'm going to say it. I clear my throat and smile. You love as nervous as I feel. 'I lo.....'. You talk over me....'I'm pregnant'.\n\nI do first or third person, prefer Discord. Pm me",

            "selftext": "Hello! I\u2019m 23 years old and I am from Florida! I have been roleplaying since I was about 15, but took a break recently! I missed it so much haha. I\u2019m just looking for someone who can write well who isn\u2019t afraid to talk outside of the roleplay as well. If you\u2019re interested, send me a message and we can finalize some things! I\u2019m an open book, so ask me anything!\n\nHere is a prompt I have written, feel free to change some things or suggest something completely different! Can\u2019t wait to hear from you!\n\nIt was a stormy Saturday afternoon, which thankfully was the only issue plaguing our meeting this afternoon. We hadn\u2019t seen each other in two years, and after I ran into one of our mutual friends from high school, somehow we ended up meeting at the mall in our hometown. \n\n\n\nWe were inseparable in high school. Our freshman year we started near the basement of the popularity spectrum; however, by the time we reached seniority, we had become star basketball player and head cheerleader. We would be with each other during every free moment we had, and sometimes artificially created extra free time just so we could be together. Everything was perfect. And then summer happened. I had slept with your best friend. Although we weren\u2019t officially in a relationship, I had broken your heart. We had gotten into a huge fight, and even though we both believed we could get through it, it didn\u2019t materialize. And now, two years later, we were preparing to speak for the first time since I had slammed the door in your face before leaving the following morning for college.",

            "selftext": "Some noteworthy information about myself: \n\n\u2022 I prefer BxG relationships! I am also willing to do some GxG, but it\u2019s nothing I\u2019m particularly good at. BxB is off the table for me, since I\u2019m poor at writing male characters. \n\n\u2022 I respond frequently! Most days, I can respond several times a day though there will be points where that\u2019s not possible. Being on break now, though, I\u2019ve got plenty of free time! Keep in mind I\u2019m in an EST time zone. \n\n\u2022 I am a literate/semi-literate role player! We all make grammar errors at one point or another, but I\u2019ve been roleplaying for 6+ years now and prefer paragraph style role-plays. \n\n\u2022 I am NOT open to NSFW scenes. If intimacy becomes a plot point, I am more than willing to include it with a time skip or a black out. Scenes with forms of tension, though, I\u2019m more than okay with! \n\n\u2022 I\u2019m happy to talk OOC! However, I\u2019m not looking for any romantic conversations. \n\n\n\nSome things I\u2019d like from you:\n\n\u2022 Preferably in the age range of 16 - 20, since I fall within that range. (Just a preference, can be discussed.)\n\n\u2022 A literacy that matches mine! \n\n\u2022 A desire to design a plot with me! It\u2019s all much less fun if you\u2019re not included! \n\n\u2022 Willing to roleplay via discord. I can also do it on reddit (I can compromise!!) but personal socials are a big no-no. \n\n\n\nPlot Ideas! \n\nI don\u2019t have any concrete ideas, but I do have the basics I\u2019m interested in. Like I said before, I\u2019d like to discuss a lot of the details personally. But, here are some ideas to hopefully spark some creativity... \n\n\u2022 Think shoujo! A sweet love story between my character and yours! Some dynamics that would be nice... \n\n         *High school dynamic. A girl who can\u2019t stand boys, but one of the most well liked boys in school takes a liking to her! Works the other way too: a popular, well loved male protagonist can\u2019t stand women (after all, they\u2019re superficial and shallow) but a chance encounter between him and the female protagonist just might change some things! \n\n          *Slice of life, romance included! Perhaps it\u2019s coworkers at a local bakery, two pop idols attempting to jump start their career, or neighbors? Can include many twist and turns! \n\n\u2022 I\u2019ve got a real soft-spot for love hate relationships. Here are some of my ideas....\n         \n          *Fantastical! Male protagonist of a mythological species (vampire? demon? devil?) takes a liking to a human girl, but she is adverse to getting close to him. Flipped: a human girl finds herself falling in love with the male protagonist, but his behavior is anything but loving. In fact, all he seems to care about is himself. \n          \n          *Fake relationships! Wolf Girl and Black Prince? A seriously screwed up event happens forcing one of the characters to need a fake partner, and the other agrees. However... they\u2019re not doing it out of the goodness of their hearts. \n\nAgain, these are some basic ideas! I\u2019d love to hear more from you! Please message me if you\u2019d be interested, thanks!",

            "selftext": "Disclaimer: I'm only caught up till the 24th episode, so I'm not too far in terms of the series. \n\nHello fellow people of the roleplaying subreddit, I've recently got into this lovely series, and I'd like to roleplay some of the characters here! \n\nBefore we get into more details, I'll introduce myself. The name's Author. I'm currently a highschool student (so please keep things non-sexual!), and my timezone is GMT+8. I typically write in 3rd POV, and the length of my responses can be quite spontaneous, which would mean that they would span from at least two paragraphs, to five, depending on what I feel like I need to write. \n\nAnyway, moving on. I'd like to roleplay a slice of life roleplay, where the characters are doing their typical shenanigans and such. I don't mind doubling for this roleplay, or playing more characters! This is also pretty much just a casual roleplay, so no need to be so invested in it! Just a fun little thing to do. \n\nCharacters I'm willing to play: \n\n- Lily Angel\n- Lynn Angel\n- Ira Blood\n- Neil Bowman \n\nNow onto the nitpicky stuff. \n\n- please, please have at least decent grammar and spelling. I tend to be picky in terms of things like these. \n- write at least one paragraph per response. It feels a bit underwhelming whenever I write a few paragraphs, and I'd only get one line as a response. \n- I only, and only, roleplay on Discord. Please have it if you'd like to roleplay with me! \n- and if this still isn't stuck to you already, this will be a non-sexual roleplay. I'm fine with romance, but let's not go too far with that. \n\nIf you're interested in roleplaying with me, send me a DM and we can discuss about it!",

            "selftext": " Hello!  \n\nAs the title suggests, I'm looking for a partner for a Cyberpunk RP. Cyberpunk is perhaps my favorite genre to write in. The high tech, low life vision of the future presented by the genre has captivated me ever since I first laid eyes on Ridley Scott's Blade Runner in my early adolescence, and I feel further down the Cyberpunk rabbit hole as I discovered William Gibson's *Neuromancer* and the various sourcebooks for Mike Pondsmith and R. Talsorian Games' Tabletop RPG Cyberpunk, and it's various iterations. And of course, I've sunk my teeth into CDPR's newest game Cyberpunk: 2077. Needless to say, Cyberpunk is a genre I'm in love with. And as such, I'm eager to flex my creative muscles within the confines of a Cyberpunk story.  \n\nWhat I'm looking for specifically is a partner I can craft both an engaging narrative and setting with. That being said, there are a few things I ask of my partners, which are listed below: \n\n \\-18+. Self explanatory. Cyberpunk is dark, and I wanna really get down to brass tacks and explore some dark/mature themes.  \n\n\\-Some familiarity with Cyberpunk as a genre. You don't need an encyclopedic knowledge of the genre, Lord knows I don't have it, but some experience writing within the genre and an understanding of it's tropes and themes would be greatly appreciated by me.\n\n \\-Scheduling consistency. As it stands, I'm at a junction in my life where my work schedule just so happens to afford a great deal of free time in the afternoons and evenings. While I do not require around the clock availability, I would like to at least have a repertoire of a few posts a week alongside some OOC discussion. If at any time you'd like to put something on gold or take a break though, don't hesitate to tell me! I try to be as flexible as possible in this regard, and it is more of a preference than a requirement.  \n\nThat covers it- if I\u2019ve managed to capture your interest, my DMs\u2019re open. I look forward to hearing from you. And of course, have a great morning, afternoon or evening.",

            "selftext": "\nHey! It\u2019s been a nice minuet since i\u2019ve made a batman roleplay. In this rp i\u2019ll be bruce/Batman and you\u2019re a new head of Gotham\u2019s police. This rp will be the end of crime in Gotham\u2019s streets. This will be a long term rp. I hope you all enjoy the prompt!\n\nStarter:\nGordon coughs being in a hospital bed. Silence filled in the room, only hearing the beeping of the heart machine. Gordon was dying from all his smoking. He looks at the cops standing in his room to pay respects. He look at you. You were his head chef in command. He points to you and curls his finger telling you come closer. You begin to get closer to him and he said in almost a whisper. \u201cKeep this city safe.\u201d He looked up into your eyes. He then turns his head to look out of the window. You and other men look out of the window into the night sky. You saw two white eyes  staring into the building. Gordon knew it was me. He closed his eyes when the machine made an endless beep. The cops take their hats off in respect. You kept your eyes on me. But in seconds bats surround me and i vanished once the bats depart. You let out a sigh and went home. \n\nThe next morning, i was just going to bed while Alfred made breakfast for himself. Knowing he\u2019ll have to make breakfast for me at noon. You were awake and ready to be at work. You grabbed your keys and a fruit shake you make every day. You got in your car driving to work. Gordon\u2019s last words to you echoed in your head. \u201cKeep this city safe\u201d you sigh and walked inside the police station. You see your new second in command in your new office. He was plugging your computer in making sure it works. You walked in and...(continue from there)\n\nConclusion:\nThank you for reading. Just so i know you read it just send the word \u201cGotham\u2019s Savior\u201d and your discord name. Thanks!\n\n\n\n\ufffc",

            "selftext": "\n\n\nAre you playing Cyberpunk? I sure am trying! But I have to go slow and be real careful so the hot fixes can keep dropping and I get less chances to encounter a game breaking glitch! I\u2019m still having such a great time the super early setting has inspired me to look for rp. Maybe likeminded people who are pacing themselves as well? I gotta say that I love Jackie in all his implied Mexican-ness, so if playing him is your jam, I\u2019ll be honored. Otherwise I\u2019m happy to hear your plots and ideas. \n\nI'm an experienced role player who has been at it for a long, long time, lots of experience has made me flexible. \n\n* I play any gender, do all LGBT couples if you want romance (I don\u2019t play straight couples if you want the romance to get pass PG), I prefer MxM. Right now I\u2019m looking for partners over 21 because I\u2019m really not comfortable with playing with younger people since I\u2019m older myself. I want to include adult themes in my rps, to make them richer and more layered.\n\nOn the perspective, I third person, any tense, I tend to gravitate to past tense. I love OOC chatter and plotting for a story, WDL gives us a big range of opportunities, whether you want to play an operative in your team or you want to come up with a new character, the possibilities are pretty endless. What I want is more adventure than anything. You know, danger and some heroism thrown in for good measure, of course it could get dark since the situation in the game is pretty bleak. \n\nOn the length, I will match my partner's post length, though I prefer 1-3 paragraphs. I like to be descriptive but I also like to have the story moving.\n\nGenres for original stuff:\n\n* Slice of life (with or without a little fantasy mixed in.)\n\n* Historical.\n\n* SciFi.\n\n* Western.\n\n* Fantasy.\n\n* Post-Apocalyptic/Survival.\n\n\nFandoms I'm into:\n\n*  Assassins' Creed.\n\n* Mass Effect.\n\n* Horizon: Zero Dawn (RP on Enduring Victory, anyone?) \n\n* Far Cry.\n\n* Uncharted.\n\n* Star Trek.\n\n* Fallout.\n\n* RDR.\n\n* The Witcher (books and games.)\n\n* Watch Dogs(any).\n\n* Etc.\n\nI also like quite a few vintage animes, just ask, also many books on fantasy as well. Like I said, just ask!\n\nPM me if you're interested! :D",

            "selftext": "Hey guys.\n\nSo I have 10+ years of experience in roleplay (yep I'm old) and I recently got into Outer Banks. Really refreshing writing and a chance to write some teenage angst and drama with lots of momentum. I'm looking for Sarah, Kiara, Pope, and JJ. I'm a few episodes from finishing season 1, but so far I can honestly say it's one of the strongest new shows out there, sort of gives me ''Bloodline'' vibes, only with a much younger cast.\n\nWhat I'm thinking about is giving an AU direction to the story. John B hasn't yet found out about Ward's implications in his father's murder. Ward just took him in as his foster parent, and he's a little bit conflicted about what that means for his relationship with Sarah. Things are still very tense between him and Kiara, the latter still not approving Sarah's involvement in the group's plans to locate the gold. The police has their eyes on John and JJ's tendancies to always be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Pope is attempting to keep his hands clean but finds himself roped in by his friends and the convincing allure of securing his financial future if they ever find what they're looking for.\n\nI'm looking for ideally someone that can write novella length, but I'm prioritizing quality over quantity. I write in third person. I'm a student working on a 4 year bachelor's degree, and I'm also a sportsman, so I'm fairly busy, though I do my best to post at the very least twice a day to keep the story going.\n\nI write on Discord but I am also open to writing here in inbox.\n\nWhen contacting me, please let me know which character is of interest to you. An OC would be interesting too if that is more your jam!",

            "selftext": "Whitecroft Asylum. Built in 1921 the vast array of buildings took up not even a quarter of the overall island it was housed on. The large main building stood as a centrepiece for the other walled-in buildings. It was surrounded by a series of other \u2018smaller\u2019 wings - able to house almost 1300 patients in total, the wings categorised alphabetically to determine the severity - or the risk - of the patient. From letter A for the most dangerous to letter D for the least.  Aside from those the grounds contained gardens, a chapel, a large water tower and further out of the way, private residences for the higher ups who worked there, Doctor Elizabeth Carter included. The outside was a prestigious contrast to the cells inside. \u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200f\u200f\u200e \u200e\u200f\u200f\u200e \u200e\u200f\u200f\u200e \u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200f\u200f\u200e \u200e\u200f\u200f\u200e \u200e\u200f\u200f\u200e\n\nIt was a gray and dreary day, especially on the docks. A cold chill was coming in off the ocean, a storm was coming. Out of the mist came the sound of diesel engines. A small squad of military men were standing around smoking and joking, trying to stay dry and warm in their raincoats. A young lieutenant, bright eyed, Robert Jones, stood next to Doctor Carter. \u201cThis new patient\u201d he noted matter-of-factly in a tone that sounded much deeper than you\u2019d expect of a man his age. \u201cYou read his file, Doc?\u201d  He looked over at her as the rain ran off his cap. The boat rang it's bell as it prepared to dock.   \n\nElizabeth stood, eyes fixated on the boat as it came to it\u2019s stop, the rain smacking the large black umbrella she held above her mercilessly. A long black coat was wrapped around her, only the black heeled shoes of the rest of her attire visible. Only when Robert had finished speaking for a few moments and the boat had come to it's complete stop did she reply, her eyes moving to the lieutenant and her lips turning up in a slight smile. \"I read his file Robert\" she responded, eyes darting back to the boat again. She silently hoped the weather wasn't some sort of eerie premonition of the chaos her new patient could bring to the island. Instead she continued, waiting for him to appear from the dock. A respectful nod was given in return of her comment and Robert stepped away, the other men putting out their cigarettes and stepping into their positions, ready for the arrival to be escorted to his new home. \n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\nHi! I'm currently looking for something long term, semi lit/lit &amp; via Discord! I've recently got back into writing and well, this setting is one of my favourites to do. I'm open to various things in this particular plot, whether it be romance, horror, NSFW scenes or drama by the bucket load. I would love to brainstorm with a potential RP partner and figure out where we would like to take our characters. Whether you play the new arrival or somebody already on the island I'm sure we can write something fun! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf this seems like your thing and you're interested in discussing more over Discord then please drop me a message!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for reading!",

            "selftext": " The Continent of Kenshi has found itself under strife yet again, the Holy Nation, United Cities and the Shek Kingdom have brought their tensions to a tipping point and have declared an all out war. With the Holy Nation now concentrating all their Zealots in keeping both the Shek and Samurai at bay they've found law and order going on a sharp decline with many villages under constant threat and extortion by roaming bandits and marauding clans. Assassinations and blood feuds have sky rocketed from the common brigands to even Nobles turning it into a full sport. With this new wave of panic and opportunity came a new generation of legends, mostly in the form of wanted men with high value bounties though. One such bounty became popular talk among the people of the United Cities and corners of the Holy Nation: The Bonedog Man. The stories traveled far and wide, telling of a master swordsman who roams the deserts alone. Donning a Wolf Helm that resembles that of the common Bonedog, his swordsmanship so remarkable that those who have claimed to have seen him say wields a Katana with only one hand.\n\nMany claim that he's been attacked by gangs of Shinobi, teams of Inquisitors and even fought against a savage Shek Chieftan and cut them to like simple greenfruit and wheat. Of course these are all hearsay and no one has presented proof of these encounters. What is true, however, which can be read on his Bounty is that the Bonedog Man is wanted for the murder of an esteemed Nobleman of the Empire and his vanguard of Samurai which included a Captain. The Nobleman himself just so happened to be a very, very, very distant cousin of the venerable Emperor Tengu. While Emperor Tengu could not necessarily confirm if they were related due to important businesses within his Vault, the idea of a man daring to touch the enlightened class was enough to warrant a Bounty of one hundred thousand cats, due to the prolonged war effort making most Samurai unavailable to hunt him down themselves. Since that day, sightings of the Bonedog Man have been uncommon; with the occasional nomad claiming see an individual dressed like an animal trekking the deserts and avoiding roads. Sometimes even a remote town claims a single man had managed to fight off a band of cannibals or dust bandits.\n\nHe's still out there though and if the stories are true...whichever man or woman managed to find him could become a very rich and influential figure in the continent. That is, should they manage to or choose to challenge him.",

            "selftext": "Hey, everyone! My name is Nikolay. I am 23 years old and located in the central time zone, also know as the Midwest. I have no role playing for about 13 to 14 years, give or take. I am going to try and keep this on the shorter end, because I would like to discuss more of the details on Discord, but I will provide more than ample explanation of what I am looking for in this post.\n\nI am looking for somebody to do a Silent Hill role play with, preferably someone who would be willing to write and DM the town, controlling monsters and NPCs, and generally helping shape the story we are looking to tell. I should obviously note that this will more than likely include rather dark themes and subjects, but, you should know that if you know what Silent Hill is.\n\nAlternatively - I could be open to a 1x1 roleplay based within the Silent Hill universe as well, but we'd have to discuss that more in depth on Discord. The one on one could consist of the theme of two survivor intertwined in the town or even going against one another.\n\nRequirements\n\n- You must be at least 18 years old. I va not roleplay these themes with you if you are not.\n\n- Have a general understanding of the content before hand. You don't need to be a lore master or have played EVERY SINGLE GAME, but having a grip on what the town is will help both of us greatly.\n\n- I'd like to do OC chat if we both decide to make this long term. Helps to have a buddy and keeps things smooth and worry free.\n\n- If you end up deciding this isn't for you, just tell me. That's all I ask.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you!",

My writing can adapt to my partner\u2019s writing length as long as it is not a one line reply. I also do a proper OC with proper templates and either anime or drawings as my OC\u2019s appearance. I wish that you guys who dm me can be at least a bit close to matching what i normally do.\n\nNow onto the things i want to do which all include romance.\n\nHighschool love which can have things like: love triangles between either two roleplayers and a controlled oc or three roleplayers.

            "selftext": "Heyo! I\u2019m sort of embarrassed about this post, but is anyone willing to role play as tf2 characters? I don\u2019t usually write as first person and it has been 2 years since I\u2019ve last had an rp, so I\u2019m a bit rusty. I have written stories before and I was willing to jump back in the field out of sheer boredom.\n\nI write paragraphs (usually around 1-6, really depends on the rp and the scene that is happening) and it takes me less than an hour to respond. I like responding quickly since I love writing and want to get back in the field. \n\nPlease dm me if you want to or if you have any questions! I like writing as Scout, Spy, Sniper, Medic, and Engineer. I don\u2019t really mind which team. I can write anything if you are willing to. It\u2019s mostly up to you and whatever it is that you are comfortable with. \n\nThe only thing that I feel uncomfortable writing with is pregnancy or anything that does not involve consent. Oh and any uncomfortable relationships. For example, there is no ScoutxSpy because it\u2019s nasty and there is no ScoutxScout. I just do not like writing out anything uncomfortable, but these characters for example could be friends \n\n Once again, please dm me if you have any questions or are willing to rp. We can write over discord or whichever you prefer. Personally I would rather write on discord since it\u2019s easier to manage.\n\nI don\u2019t have any original characters and like using the ones from the comics, but I also have a lot of headcanons and I am willing to try making an OC if you are more comfortable with that. Personally speaking, I have never written with an OC character and only did the canon characters.",

            "selftext": " hello, thank you very much for taking an interest in my post today. i hope you have a very happy holiday!  \ni\u2019m looking for some literate partners for some fandoms today, my fandoms are limited rn since i'm only craving a few, but i hope to find someone interested in them!\n\nplease be sure to read all of my rules and not skim over them, i just want to make sure we\u2019ll get along well. without further ado, let\u2019s get into it!\n\n\ud835\udc20\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1d \ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc31\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2c.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \uff65 \uff61\uff9f\u2606: \\*.\u263d .\\* :\u2606\uff9f. \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\n\u2799 Please be above the age of 18, I don\u2019t want to roleplay with minors. Nothing against them! It\u2019s just for my personal comfort. \u2665\n\n\u2799 I only double! OCxCanon where we play a canon character for each other and our OCs. If this doesn't interest you, please don't reach out to me!\n\n\u2799 I consider myself lit. / adv lit! I can write quite a bit when I\u2019m feeling inspired and while I don\u2019t expect you to match, I do expect you to put your best foot forward though, as will I!\n\n\u2799 Your grammar and spelling don\u2019t have to be perfect. This goes hand in hand with the rule above - just try your best and I\u2019ll be happy. \\^\\^\n\n\u2799 Please write in the third person, 1st person is hard for me to immerse myself in. Past or present tense is fine with me, but I usually stick with past tense!\n\n\u2799 Real-life comes first, take breaks when you need to, don't feel pressured to respond every day, and take your time. Roleplay is a hobby, not a job! Plus, I have... lots n' lots of patience. If you disappear for months, I guarantee if you come back and ask to start up again I'd likely say yes.\n\nHowever, do please keep me updated! Even if it's a simple 'I'm doing okay' I'd like to know that everything is alright! While we're on that topic, please talk to me OOC as well! I love headcanons and rambling about the roleplay as we write. Plus, who doesn't love making new friends?\n\n\u2799 I\u2019m willing to play any canon character for you in return for you writing one for me, I might stumble at first, but I will try my best. Please be willing to do the same. It\u2019s okay if you\u2019re not perfect, I\u2019m not expecting you to be, but be willing to leave your comfort zone! On that note, if we share the same interest, I\u2019m okay with splitting, doing an AU on my end, or switching.\n\n\u2799 I only roleplay on Discord or through email.\n\n\u2799 I am ghost friendly, no hard feelings! I don't try to ghost anyone unless I'm very uncomfortable, but I understand when people need/want to just dip out without a goodbye. Goodbyes can be awkward!\n\n\u2799 Romance is cool, fun, and funky fresh (that\u2019s the whole point of doubling lol) but I want a plot too! Please, throw me your plot ideas, AUs, and whatever else! Mystery, drama, action, adventure, horror, angst, throw everything you have at me - I would love to plot with you!! That being said, communication is key, please give me more input than 'sounds good/okay/im fine with that'!\n\nthat\u2019s it - i\u2019m really not that picky! i like to think i\u2019m very open to most things people can throw at me, but as long as you can follow those basic guidelines, please message me!! i don\u2019t bite! C: and of course, as above, so below - all of these rules apply to me just as much as they do to you.\n\n\ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc2c - \ud835\udc22 \ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc32 \ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1e, \ud835\udc22 \ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27'\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc28 \ud835\udc28\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc31\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc1c \ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2b \ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc31\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \uff65 \uff61\uff9f\u2606: \\*.\u263d .\\* :\u2606\uff9f. \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\n\u21dd Jojo's Bizarre Adventure\n\nI am caught up with the manga / anime but prefer if we stick to roleplaying in the anime parts.

            "selftext": " *I'm 18+ and I'm looking for a 18+ partner for RP.*\n\nChristmas time and I\u2019m here again in search for what we all want: a RP partner that won\u2019t ghost lol. So with no further due: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**- Requirements -** \n\n* Be +18 and comfortable with all NSFW aspects of the story \n* Use Discord or Google Docs or mix\n* Fantasy (high or low)/medieval\n* Only OC\n* Third person + past tense + at least\u00a0**two paragraphs**\u00a0\\+ descriptive\n* **Romance**\n* At least\u00a0**one reply per day**\u00a0(If for some reason you can't reply that day, please inform)\n* No ghosting\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**- My Writing Style -** \n\n**I expect my partner to match my style**. I write in\u00a0**third person and past tense** and I consider myself a **literate/advanced writer**. I'm a pretty descriptive person when it comes to everything (clothes, locations, actions, emotions). I like responses that include what the character is thinking and not just describing actions, I think the RP becomes more interesting that way. However, I also match my partner's length and of course, it depends on the situation (if the scene needs shorter responses, then shorter responses it is).\u00a0***No one-liners and at least two paragraphs per response PLEASE!***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**- Themes -** \n\nI'm strictly looking for a RP set in a **DnD/medieval type of world**, it can be high fantasy/low fantasy/no fantasy at all just medieval. I'm looking for a RP filled with: action scenes, interesting lore, tension, politics, and\u00a0**romance**\u00a0between our characters! I have some rough ideas in mind but nothing set on stone. **But I'm also always open to listen to new ideas, so don't be afraid of telling me about them however complex they may sound**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**- RP itself -** \n\n*WORLD:* I love\u00a0**worldbuilding**\u00a0from scratch (religion, cultures, kingdoms, cities, maps...) and I would love to create something like that with someone. This world can be populated only with humans and with no magic OR it can have other races and magic. I think you can get the idea that I'm pretty open about the world, the only requirements are fantasy/medieval. (Please, insert the word\u00a0*Grinch* in your message so I can know you've read the whole thing). \n\n*CHARACTERS:* I\u00a0**do not play fandoms**, only OC, and I use reference pictures for characters and always create a bio for them (we can discuss a bio model that can work for both of us). My main character is always female and I'm more comfortable playing as **human or elf** but for side characters, I'm super comfortable playing other genders or races.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**- Themes inside the RP -** \n\nI want a partner who is comfortable with\u00a0**all**\u00a0themes included in the NSFW spectrum. I have no triggers at all but if something is too heavy for me or you, we can discuss it. I'll give more details about this part in private.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**- Now, about me -** \n\nI'm 22F and I've been RPing for five years now. I can deliver multiple responses a day, but I do understand that there are people that can't do that.\u00a0**One response per day**\u00a0would be the required for me. I do enjoy some OOC but is not required, what is required however is the minimum communication while worldbuilding and during the RP to let each other know if we are going offline for a while, have problems with the RP, suggestions, new ideas. I'm comfortable writing on Discord or Google Docs or even a mix of both.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Important**\n\n\\- **don't be shy to tell me about your ideas and opinions!**\n\n\\- **I only respond to DMS!!**\n\n**- Send me a DM with a little about yourself, ideas and so on. Be creative!**",

At least once a day, if possible. I just want someone to throw ideas around with, to write with fandom characters or original characters. \n\n* I'm looking for someone **over the age of 18**, and I am very comfortable with mature situations- in fact, I love them, haha. For ships, I like mxm, mxf, and fxf. Anything, really. I'm incredibly LGBT friendly.\n* I'll write female ocs if you need me too!\n* My favorite fandoms are Stranger Things, The Walking Dead, and Dead by Daylight. I'm willing to try other fandoms too but I'm currently obsessed with Stranger Things so things in that fandom would be ***FANTASTIC***. I love to ship my original characters with Steve or Billy! \n* I have an entire page of original characters ready to show you and I'm excited to explain their backstories and such! I'm down with either shipping them with one of your original characters or a fandom character! \n* I like romance plots with slice of life elements, horror themes, paranormal stuff, and some sci-fi. I don't really like fantasy things, sorry!\n* I like to write a paragraph at a time or two, never one-liners. My length will match yours! \n\nThanks for reading, I'm looking forward to hearing from you! :)",

            "selftext": "The Sunday summer shower pelts down against the living room window in front of Belle. The weather matching her eyes, her emotions and her life in this moment. The only sounds around her in the deafening silence of the room, is the tick tock of her wall clock and the rain tinging on the window.\u00a0\n\n\nHer heart is still pounding in her chest. Her lips still tingle from where\u00a0his\u00a0touched, the remnants of his kiss feeling like a bruise upon them now. She still feels like she can\u2019t breath, but every time she is with him somehow she\u00a0forgot\u00a0to breath, so that\u2019s not a new feeling. Though this time, that feeling goes along with his touch, like his finger tips are tattooed upon her skin. The memory and feeling of his hands on her, replaying over and over in her mind. It had felt so natural, so normal,\u00a0so right.\u00a0\n\nHow she could love someone this deeply, this\u00a0intensely, and someone who\u00a0never\u00a0actually belonged to her,\u00a0was crazy.\u00a0\nShe felt like a rag doll, like a puppet, like she was always dancing on his strings. The stings that he controlled fully\u00a0and\u00a0entirely. Not in the sense that he did it on purpose, more in the sense of her own feelings. She\u2019d do anything for him. When he called, she would go running. If he ever needed anything, she was there in a heartbeat, and with a smile on her face.\u00a0\n\nI mean, it wasn\u2019t one sided, he did the same for her. Every time she ever needed him, he was there in minutes. He is\u2014was\u00a0her best friend. Her childhood crush. Her adulthood love. Though he never knew any of this.\u00a0Not till tonight at least.\n\nHe\u2019s getting\u00a0married, and to the love of his life, in a week. Just 7 days until she loses any chance at her one true love. At her happily ever after. At the life she'd always dreamed about, the relationship she'd always craved, and the man she had\u00a0always\u00a0wanted. The one all others are put up against,\u00a0instantly, but never even come close.\u00a0\nBut maybe she never actually had a chance to begin with.\u00a0\n\n________________________________________________________\n\nHey guys! I am back here after so so long and this is what I had in mind. I know the write up is pretty long but it should give you a fair idea of what the plot is.\n\nI won't waste any more time of yours here. If you like it, you can drop a message. I have many more plots that we can try too and I would love to hear your ideas as well!!\n\nTalk to you soon xx",

This is intended to be a friendly thing and not an intended romance story even though I would ask for 18+ solely as I do not feel comfortable rping with people who are underage and there will more than likely be graphic themes of violence. I would prefer someone who potentially is somewhat ooc talkative to make friends and someone who would like to sink some time into this with replies being anywhere from a few times a week to daily depending on your free time. I work from home so I will more than likely be instant replies to it.\n\nThis will not be a novel based roleplay and will be more conventional, Meaning we will be roleplaying the characters in both 1st and 3rd person (depending on the person) in a pseudo \"D&amp;D\" style setting with insert flavour text context and setting chat done by myself in times of downtime and in times of needed descriptions.\n\nI am hopefully wanting to do one of a few things these include but not limited to an apocalypse survival, Warcraft, generic fantasy, Lord of the rings, Vampire (Vampire the masquerade based), generic sci fi/space travel.",

            "selftext": "Hello there! I am a 27 year old female (prefer 21+ partners) in search of a role playing partner who is interested in a MxM pairing for a few plot ideas of mine. I'm also interested in your ideas as well if there is a plot you want to play that could go along with my OC! I have a new OC that I want to explore and right now I want to get lost in a story with someone! I use discord for RP and write in third person one to five paragraphs all depending on what is going on. I prefer to have multiple threads even with different characters or AUs. I'm interested right now in a modern setting with some magic and fantasy elements, maybe even some divine elements as well such as greek/norse gods! My OC is rugged but very intelligent with an extraverted personality who got himself into some trouble and is currently on the run, message me to find out more! If you have an OC you've been dying to play, and think they would work for what I'm looking for, tell me all about them! Chances are, I will grow to love them just as much as my own OCs, at least that's what I hope for! It's also a plus if you have a lot of time on your hands and want to be friends OOC! I always try to become good friends with my partners! I look forward to hearing from you.",

            "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nHey! I'm in search of a partner who enjoys Fantasy roleplay scenarios! For example, if anyone has seen Avenue 5, it's in a weird, somewhat modern but futuristic world that allows people to cruise through space and communication can happen but there is always a delay.\n\nAnyway, I thought of some plots and I was hoping that any of them would spark an interest to someone interested in roleplaying! I do roleplay in Third Person as I feel it makes more sense to give detail and what my character is physically doing. Sometimes, I may go into first person for certain actions but I try to stay constant. I don't ask for several paragraphs. All I ask for is enough detail for the situation and time for my character to be able to keep up with yours!\n\nI have some brand new scenarios I would like to try out and see how they flow!\n\nNumber 4 Seems to be my new favorite.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. I am an Android made from Cyberlife. I am the newest model to be released to local retail stores within the Salt Lake City, Utah area. It's also where the first CyberLife store had opened up. You are a normal human being looking for a Companion to bring here so things don't ever feel so quiet and alone. This new Android model is equipped to act JUST like a human being would. Normal emotions, feelings, everything you could imagine! Your character kept seeing advertisements for them on streaming networks and finally decided it is time for a brand new friend! Of course, the Government and Public Opinion are skeptical of these new Android models because of how they are extremely close to human life, but no reports have been made against the new model and are continuing to be wonderful friends to those who buy a new model!\n2. Our characters live in this unusual world. By unusual, I mean some people have taken weird medications provided from the government to the doctors to make some people more compliant. My character is one of those people who fell for the scheme of these pills and now they are much like antidepressants where they control your mood and you're unsure of how the real world is around you. Your character is someone who won't fall for the scheme and happens to run into me and notices that he is under control of the same medication. It is her job to help him with his issue in trying to see what the real world is and maybe a massive change campaign can happen to actually tell people the truth of what is really happening. \n3. In this magical, fantasy land of Agartha, Elves ruled the land for many years. It was all one Kingdom and some land belonging to the Elves. Now, a new kind of being has moved into the land and has taken residence. These are Assassins (your character). They are ruthless and stop at nothing to be able to take over whatever they desire. However, Agartha is massive and they are still trying their best to claim land that isn't theirs. This is why a massive war has broken out between the two races. However, a local, massive market is one of those grey areas where no combat is allowed and EVERYONE has to get along with each other. It is a peaceful area where nothing should ever take place. Each side has respected that rule. My character and yours happen to be just turning the age of adults and have been crowned leaders of a squad unit. However, things start to change when my character ends up going alone on trips to places such as a river or anywhere else that could be good for him.\n4. Your character is a school bully. You have been known around the school for that very same reason and have a select group of friends who are as well the same way as you. You may also get along with CERTAIN guys at the school. However, I am the new kid at the college campus and I happen to arrive on a day that you end up skipping a class to hang out with your friends at the cafeteria they have there. Of course, you want to impress your friends and show off, so you go over and begin to intimidate my character and do whatever it takes to make him realize that you're not playing around and this is your turf. He may be scared of you, but at some point, you may see a change in his attitude. We can discuss that attitude at a later time.",

            "selftext": "Hey there! I hope you\u2019re all enjoying your days! Today I\u2019m currently looking for a new partner to do a literate romance based in an older Ninja Turtle universe after a dear partner disappeared. In terms of style, I\u2019m going for the 2012 designs, but we can definitely discuss setting, scenario and character details to fit our needs! This will involve you playing a canon character for one of my original characters. I am happy to double if needed as well, and we can have two separate roleplays going for whatever you\u2019re interested in doing in this fandom universe! I\u2019m also interested in the punk turtle designs by Sirconcon and would be open to discussing something there! This is rather vague I\u2019m aware, however I really want us to build something tailored to our wants and needs! So if you\u2019re interested in a literate, plot-driven romance with some older crime fighting turtles, you\u2019ve come to the right place! \n\nRules \n\n1. Please be a literate, 3rd person player. You do not need to write a novel, however sentence/paragraph structure are a huge must for me. No text talk or improper punctuation.\n2. Please be active overall. I understand we have lives, however, if you are the type to disappear/ghost, I am not for you. I want us to keep a steady stream going so things do not get stale! If you do need to leave, please just communicate.\n3. This will be romance and plot focused. Get ready to write something wonderful together! \n4. Because the characters are all going to be 21+ here, I am asking that you also be at least 21 years old yourself. \n5. Please be okay with MxM romantic pairings. If you request a double, I can do MxF or MxM for you. \n\nIf interested, feel free to PM me! Thank you so much for reading, and have a wonderful day!",
