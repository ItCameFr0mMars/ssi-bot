On the surface, Lovelorn is a beautiful aesthetic paradise, full of artists and art enthusiasts. Inspiration can be found in almost every direction within this beautiful city at the base of the mountains. At the heart of the city, is the Amada museum that holds both exhibitions and art auctions. However, Lovelorn has it\u2019s fair share of secrets, including shady art auctions as the tip of the ice berg.\n\nI don\u2019t have a plot in mind per say, just bring your OC and get ready to meet my OCs and take it from there. A little slice of life, romance, drama if you will. I have a couple of different OCs that are both male and female.\n\nOff the top of my head, the only requests I have are that you be semi lit to lit. Please only message if over 18. I\u2019d really like to have a long term rp partner, and this is only one idea, so I\u2019m open to more! I prefer discord for communications.",

Today I would like to base something off one of my favourite genres of all time, the murder mystery/thrillers. \n\nI am looking for a story to be in that type of a zone, think Seven. I would be playing a female detective who has been a case and the deeper the case the goes, the more dangerous &amp; complicated it becomes. \n\nI have been writing for a few years and my writing style is adaptive but I much prefer the length to be very detailed and descriptive. \n\nMy last prompt got a lot of requests and so that\u2019s why my suggestion is that you\u2019re really interested in playing this, please do put some effort in your initial message or else I might not be able to respond and talk to you. \n\nI only write on discord and I only write with people over the age 18. \n\nI would like to discuss this further with anyone interested.

            "selftext": "Hey there, writers &amp; roleplayers!\n\nI'm a long-time writer &amp; roleplayer who's fallen into the rabbit hole again, and I'm looking for the right person to fill that void with.  I've been browsing posts for a few days looking for someone to brew up a story with, and while I've met a couple of wonderful folk, I think it's time to reach out myself and see who feels they'd mesh well with me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Me**\n\nI'm a 30 year old woman from the eastern side of the US. I've been writing for around 20 of those years, on and off, and I'm currently well in a high-point of spending my evenings writing and dreaming.  I write everything from fantasy universes to sci-fi to cyberpunk to modern with a supernatural twist.  As long as there's something that draws me out of the world we live in day to day, I'll probably be interested in the story.\n\nI prefer to find partners that transcend any single plot or story. I like to chat here and there, have our inside jokes, and be real - if online - friends. (Is that an oxymoron?) I'm private about my real life, but for as real as online friends can be, I enjoy the connection.  They make the characters and stories we write feel so much more personal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**My Ideal Partner**\n\n* .. is 18+; preferably closer to my age.  I care less for your age (beyond 18) and more for your maturity.\n* .. writes using Discord, in the third person.  Past or present doesn't matter to me.\n* .. has significant experience in writing / roleplaying.  Everyone makes typos.  No worries!  I'm not one to crucify for little mistakes; however, my ideal partner will possess a comparable love and excitement for language to I.\n* .. understands that we're both human, and have real lives to take care of first.  There will be days where I'm just not in the creative mindset, or where I have too much to do and won't find the spoons to conjure a reply.  It'll happen to you, too.  Of course, there will be other days (like today) where I've nothing but time and overflowing creative energy.\n* .. enjoys OOC communication.  I like getting excited about the plot with my partner.\n* .. is willing to play the role of a GM to craft / narrate the world around my character.  Being a forever-GM across a multitude of roleplays and tabletop groups, I understand the effort involved in crafting a world and moving the various chess pieces around a character.  In exchange, I can promise you a wealth of introspection and narration of my character's mental leaps, thoughts, and feelings; enough that you'll have plenty to go on, and have an enjoyable time learning how your machinations affect my character.\n* .. is open and honest.  Having fun?  Let me know!  Not having fun?  Let's chat about what can change to make it a better experience.  There seems to be this prevalent fear of bringing up what isn't working until one partner is resigned to the RP being dead.  I'd prefer to avoid that ultimate end unless we've thoroughly tried and failed to remedy any issues.\n* .. absolutely not required, but live back-and-forth is nice when replies are snappy/short.  Sometimes it really fits the mood of a scene.  Other times it's nice to spend a long while thinking through a word-bomb.\n* .. is LGBTQ+ accepting.\n* Keep a positive outlook. :-)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Plot Hooks**\n\n* Star Wars!  I've written a shameful amount of content in this universe, and I'm almost always hungry for more.  I have a special place in my heart for Sith/Jedi apprenticeships, and would love to drum up a character to put through the hardships in almost any era.  For this prompt, I would ask that my partner have a passion for the universe, and be familiar with more content than just the movies.  There's a trove of outstanding content out there, and I would love someone familiar with it!\n* Cyberpunk / Sci-fi!  Whether Cyberpunk 2077, or Altered Carbon, or Blade Runner, or something of a similar vein.  I'm rather open on the direction this takes and the character I play.  It's an itch I haven't had scratched in some time.  Of course, those are just some examples of universes with a similar vibe to what I have in mind.  I'm completely open to a fully homebrew world of your own.\n* World of Darkness / Vampire / etc.!  I so love supernatural content, whether in the modern day or the ancient world.  From vampires to werewolves to mages to whatever other horrors and haunts may exist in the world.  I would love to play an innocent character who finds herself suddenly immersed in a maelstrom of horror, and must adapt to survive; or join them!\n* Have something else in mind?  These are the three that interest me most, but I am *always* open to new ideas!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Questions for you**\n\n* How old are you?\n* What are your preferred pronouns?\n* What timezone are you in?\n* Please provide a couple of writing samples.  This is huge in selecting the right partner.\n* Which prompt tickles your fancy most?  What are your initial thoughts for a plot in it?\n* How do you make your favorite type of sandwich?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking forward to your messages!  Please use the Reddit mail function, not direct chat.\n\nStardust",

I'd like you to play someone who works with me, maybe a doctor or a nurse. We've both had a horrible time recently and have signed up to six months in a really remote project in a very obscure, remote country. We meet a week or two before to do some training and get on.\n\nAfter flying out to the capital of the country we'll work in, we change to a tiny twin propeller plane. There's just us two, the pilot and a stranger. As we fly an hour, two hours over the sea to the final destination, the engines start to splutter. I look in your eyes and see fear.\n\nI wake up injured and still inside the plane. The flames threaten to engulf us. I'm able to carry you out just in time before the fusillage explodes, leaving no other survivors. It's just us. \n\nOver the next few weeks, we manage to survive, becoming closer. We wait in vain to be rescued. Eight months pass before a helicopter arrives. By then, I'm a lot more muscular. You are two but your stomach is a lot bigger with our first child. \n\nI'd love to play out our survival and our we react to our pregnancy and the subsequent events. Over 18s only",

            "selftext": "Good day to you!\n\nI am feeling an adventure; perhaps you would like to come along. For this RP, I would like for our two characters to go on whirlwind adventures while also growing together and as individuals. I think it would be fun to play either a Star Wars based adventure or a D&amp;D style adventure perhaps on the seas or across lands filled with magic and monsters. Either one is just fine.\n\nAs for the themes, anything from a lighthearted tale where within a span of 20 minutes our heroes can foist the efforts of the stereotypical villains to save the day again, all the way to a dark and lengthy plot whereby our characters are tested to the ends of their limits with drama, heartache, and despair. Happy plots to very dark and depraved are fine. The latter seems the most common and the most fun. But, every tale of sorrow needs a little light hearted fun at times too. So, perhaps a mix of the two?\n\nThe adventure part is what I believe keeps everything going. However, I feel the big part of the story is really the dynamic between our characters and their evolution as individuals. If we play the Star Wars universe, then what will our characters be? Will they be Sith Lords wandering the galaxy with the goal of destroying and causing havoc and bringing those they find under their submission? Will they be Jedi in search of ancient forgotten relics? What will be the dynamic between the characters? Are they fated lovers? Are they enemies forced to work together for a common goal? Are they best friends set on the same path only to discover that they really see the world differently?\n\nIf we are playing in the realms of magic and dragons, then maybe these two are paired on an ancient quest to find an ancient civilization lost for centuries? Maybe they are working together to save a town or village from the scourge of a wizard\u2019s curse? And who are these brave souls? Maybe they are a brother sister duo seeking to repair their family\u2019s name after generations of disgrace. Perhaps they are dragons in human form fated to atone for their crimes against their deity to return to their draconic forms?\n\nIf these ideas at least remotely spark some interest in writing with me, then continue along. If not, well then I suppose this is your stop. Have a nice day mate! For those who have continued, what I really think is important in this RP is the dynamic. The adventures can come and go and change and evolve. But the dynamic, now that really appeals to me. If you are passionate about a character idea and who they are in whichever world you wish to be in, then please let me know. I really like to play with people who are passionate about their characters, the story, and writing itself.\n\nNow, for the bit about me. I am male. I am 30. I love to write. One post a day is my minimum. I can try for more, but life can be busy at times. I will tell you OOC if I am unable to post. I put a lot of thought and effort into my posts. I would like the same in return. I like planning and discussion OOC. I get that it is nice to have the element of surprise in RP and having that anticipation of wondering what your partner is going to write. But, we do need to be on the same page as for the plot and an understanding of what is going on. I don\u2019t like jumping head first into a RP. We need to plan. I don\u2019t really care for putting a post length. One liners are a no go. But, quality over quantity. I can write drivel for ages and have zero value. Or, I could write a page and keep the reader hung on every word. It\u2019s style and finesse more than anything.\n\nAs for you, I only ask that you love to write. Just love what you do. If the story isn\u2019t enjoyable for you, or your character doesn\u2019t appeal to you, then how could it possibly appeal to me? If you have an OC that you really love and want to plop them in a new world we create, fantastic! Lovely! I want to work with you to make this fun. I want to sit down and figure out what we can do to make a story that could be appealing to audiences watching on a TV screen. I want you to be excited about hearing that little noise that discord makes when a new message pops up. I want to nearly have highs and lows of feelings for our characters. We need to have fun. We can create a great story of adventure and fun together. All I ask is that we try. So, do you want to come on an adventure with me?\n\nI only play on discord. Feel free to message me however you would like. Sending a carrier pigeon sounds cool. Never had one of those. It seems inefficient. But is sounds cool! Please respond with ideas. A message saying \u2018hey I wanna RP\u2019 is the equivalent of walking up to an employer and saying \u2018give me a job\u2019. If that actually worked, unemployment would be zero. Anyway, have an awesome day, talk soon!",

            "selftext": "Hello, I'm a 20 M roleplayer looking for a somewhat niche crossover. My roleplay partner is working on something, and I really need my fix so... I'm looking for an Aaron Hotchner (Criminal Minds) to my Fox Mulder (X-Files), with plenty of romance, crime, slice of life, mild fluff, and drama. Since I'm over 18 and searching for partners in that same age range, NSFW is welcome. \n\nI play Mulder as a transfer back to the BAU after season one of the X-Files, but the finale isn't canon here. He and Dana Scully were simply reassigned, and Deep Throat vanished off the grid. Scully and Mulder keep in touch constantly, and Mulder does still believe in aliens and seek out the truth, but neither Mulder nor Scully have actually seen one or handled a case with visual evidence of said extraterrestrial beings, only cases of the unexplained, genetic mutations, the paranormal, etc. (These modifications were necessary in order to allow the crossover to be as smooth as possible.)\n\nIt should be noted that I'm a literate writer (para/multipara/novella) and I **don't double.** I would like to explore their relationship after they've started dating and how the rest of the team reacts to it, all while in the midst of solving interesting new crimes. It should be noted that my Mulder is gay, but sees Dana Scully as his best friend in the world. She means everything to him, and he misses her every day despite having become accustomed to his reassignment and his relationship with Hotch.\n\nIf this sounds like your thing, feel free to interact with this post or message me for my Discord, and we can get down to it.",

            "selftext": "\nNick Carraway was a man of little luxury unlike his neighbour. He didn\u2019t long for riches or fame, or women in such a way Gatsby did. And maybe a small part of him wondered what life would be like if he was slightly more ambitious. Less happy to settle with watching Gatsby from afar. \n\nIt was the following morning after the accident, and he\u2019d decided that perhaps some flowers might cheer the blonde up. The same kind he\u2019d used to seduce daisy, seeing as he still had some left over, and the scent was causing his allergies to act up. It was a polite and simple gesture. A sign that maybe even if daisy didn\u2019t call, he had someone else who cared deeply. \n\nHe had just about gotten to the gate, a navy sweater and bow tie paired with matching trousers adorning his slender figure. That\u2019s when he heard it. The unmistakable sound of a gunshot. It wasn\u2019t like Jay had anything to hunt on the grounds. He\u2019d never seen him handle a gun. Which made him panic.\n\n\u201cJay?! Jay?\u201d He called out as he fumbled to push the gate open and rushed towards the sound. What he found was Jay Gatsby, his pool slowly tainting red with his blood. Without thinking he jumped in after him. That\u2019s when he heard the second gunshot, as he dragged Jay out of the water, and pressed his sweater against his wound. \n\nHis hands trembled as he looked from the fallen man, to Jay. He breathed out and gently held the man in his arms, pressing on his wound. \u201cHelp! We need help!! An ambulance! A doctor! Someone please!\u201d He yelled, though he was sure his voice wavered. He looked down at Jay and gulped back his fear, smiling slightly. \u201cI thought you might have wanted to catch lunch together. I\u2019m afraid it might have to wait.\u201d He said softly. \n\n\u2728Hello!! \u2728\nIf you\u2019d made it this far it probably means you\u2019re interested, which is amazing! This is my idea for a starter, taking place just after Jay Gatsby was shot, with hopefully a far less tragic ending. \nThis would be a ship Roleplay between Nick and Jay, based on their need for each other. Literate- advanced literate role players please, and I\u2019m okay with either gender irl. We can discuss more in messages, though chat works equally as well too. \nWell old sport, hope to hear from you soon!",

Id like for this to be long term possibly even from their first encounter if you'd like. I would also like to note that being as this is a romance story there will be adult scenes involved whenever the situation arises so no partners under the age of 18 please. \n\nI have personally always loved the drama that can come from this type of story and there is so much we can do with it so I'd love to hear any ideas you may have for along the way. Whether it be the superhero becoming afraid at first of being involved with someone due to her enemies or maybe just feeling like she doesn't have enough free time to uphold a relationship. We can include any number of things.\n\nI'd prefer you play as a already established hero if possible but if you'd like to create your own superhuman to play as that's completely okay as well! Below I have listed my personal favorite heroes but feel free to suggest any of your own. :)\n\nD.C.:\n\nZatanna\n\nWonder Woman/ Diana Prince\n\nSupergirl/ Kara Danvers\n\nStarfire/ Kori Anders\n\nGreen lantern (Jessica Cruz)\n\nPowergirl/ Kara Zor-L\n\n\nMarvel:\n\nCaptain Marvel/ Carol Danvers\n\nWanda Maximoff/ scarlett witch\n\nBlack Widow/ Natasha Romanoff\n\nelektra natchios",

Just be communicative if something comes up.\n\n-I do a lot of worldbuilding, and i\u2019d hope my partner would do the same!\n\n-Id prefer my partner be 18+.\n\n-This is a plot-focused rp.  \n\n-Id prefer if my partner had visual aides with their character! If you have difficulty finding any, let me know I can do my best to help!\n\nThe year is 20XX.\n\nHumans have reached a turning point.  Colonies and cities have been established all throughout the solar system, spanning from Mercury to Pluto.  Each had their own system of government, separately functioning from a main governing body.  Few inter-spacial laws apply to every planet, leaving much room for loopholes and shortcuts through the political process.  Some planets, like Pluto, have little government presence, while others, like Neptune, have an almost Eastern-like aura surrounding it.  \n\nBounty hunting has become a warmly-accepted job, along with a multitude of other formerly-illegal occupations.  Groups like the (i don\u2019t have a name for this oops) help facilitate these groups, with weekly bounty postings and even a TV show for the best performers of that week! We\u2019re in the space age, bay-be!\n\nI\u2019d like this plot to focus around two bounty hunters, starting off with them in a small ship, and slowly growing to include a wide cast of characters on the vessel.  Id like elements of betrayal, misinformation, and action/adventure to be included.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019re interested! Please, MESSAGE ME. I don\u2019t read comments.",

I rolepaly in third person &amp; past tense, literacy being a must! Usually my replies are around 2-5 paragraphs long, depending on how thrilling the RP is ofcourse. Normally I\u2019m also quite a fast replier (hourly; with the exception of at night)\n\nGenerally, I roleplay as either Bucky Barnes, Jason Todd and Draco Malfoy. I\u2019ve been doing those three for years and I\u2019m pretty familiar with them. I also very much enjoy doing genderbended female versions of them, I\u2019ve been recently doing Fem!Draco and really enjoyed it, so if that\u2019s your lane, definitely hit me up!\n\nUsually, I can RP with any character from any fandom that I\u2019m familiar with to make it work with my character, I also don\u2019t mind crossovers. In the past I\u2019ve done the most random pairings, and I must say those are often the most interesting RPs. I\u2019m not the biggest fan of OCs, though.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in giving it a shot, please hit me up by commenting or sending an DM. I can RP here on Reddit, on IG or on Kik (and maybe Discord, if asked nicely). \n\n\u2764\ufe0f",

            "selftext": "Hello and thank you for taking a look at my ad. Tonight, I am looking for something a little different from my usual. A bad boy meets good girl, love of one\u2019s life story that starts in their high school years and ends in a bitter break up sometime after graduation, leading to reuniting later in their adult lives. An obsessive love on both sides where the physical and emotional chemistry is magnetic and all consuming. When they are together, they are often in their own world. The kind of young love where simply being apart brings about angst. \n\nPlease note that this is a starter plot, and what I have is flexible. I\u2019m looking for someone who will build the story with me to make this our own unique experience. \n\nA small country town out in the middle of nowhere is the setting. My character is an intelligent country boy who already has a tragic past which has molded him into the delinquent he is today. Your character I see as more of a city or big town girl, and she transfers to this small town due to a parent\u2019s work in the middle of a school year. Perhaps the daughter of a minister, teacher, or some type of law enforcement personnel.  I\u2019m open to your ideas, so please don\u2019t feel restricted to those suggestions.\n\nFor the teens, it is love at first sight. The school is a very small one with barely 60 kids in the graduating class each year, so a new transfer student in any grade would stick out like a sore thumb in this close knit town. I\u2019d love to brainstorm ideas on how they meet for the first time.\n\nThe point of starting the story in their teen years is to establish that deep bond of a first love that never truly goes away. Unfortunately, they do break up. And this takes us to a point maybe 10-15 years later in their adult lives when they bump into each other once again, rekindling what was lost so long ago.\n\nFrom there we can plot further. I would love to add many different elements to the story including (but not exclusive to) action, drama, comedy, and angst and strife. \n\n**What I\u2019m looking for in a partner:**\n\nI\u2019m hoping for someone who is a more advanced writer, and I mean that on a character level mostly. If you\u2019re a more cinematic writer that is detached from her main character, that isn\u2019t what I mean by advanced, and our styles will not mesh. Very descriptive, detailed writing in regards to your character\u2019s emotions, appearance, thoughts, and reactions are what I\u2019m wanting, and I will definitely give you the same in return. This is a romance roleplay, after all, and the more immersive character wise, the better, no? Someone who also likes to write setting, environment, and can set up a scene would be a great balance as well, but the character portrayal is what is most important to me.\n\nPlease write in third person, past tense in multi paragraph form. I\u2019m not a stickler on word count as long as your posts are well thought out, quality posts. I\u2019m also not the grammar police, but I prefer someone who has a good grasp on grammar.\n\nPlease be willing to actively add to the plot, and please be open to discussing the plot in OOC chat as this is really only a starter plot, and I prefer to develop with my partner for a fun and unique experience.\n\nPlease be 25 or older as I like to include mature themes and am not comfortable writing with anyone younger than that.\n\nIf you are interested, please send me a private message and be willing to share a writing sample. I will return in kind. Looking forward to hearing from you. :)",

My name is Jada and I have a fair bit of experience under my belt but it's been a while since I've roleplayed so I'm not as good as I used to be but I'm ready to shake some of the dust off. I'm a pretty chill partner, I love to chat ooc about the RP and discuss ideas, future scenes, etc. Adult Themes will be involved so I ask my partner be 18+. In regards to replies I don't mind if it's once a day or multiple times, I try to always respond in a timely manner. I usually like to take at least 2 days a week off from the rp to avoid burnout on both ends.\u00a0\n\n\nThe role I have in mind involves a college student whose ad for a roommate is answered by someone completely different from who it was assumed to be. When I opened the door on the other side stood a giant of a man, holding a box labeled 'Clothes'.\u00a0\n\n\nSmall Detail:\n\nYour character provides very little background or information about themselves\n\nWe can start from when your character first arrives or after they've been there a while.\u00a0\n\n\nI don't have many specifics put together because there is only one really but I am looking for two different personality types to be played by your character:\n\n\nCocky and humorous. A flirt and womanizer, knows how to work his charm. A hot-head with a short temper.\u00a0\n\nQuiet and Brooding. Always looks mean but that's not the case. Hot-head with a short temper.\n\n\nIf any of this appeals to you I'm open for a partner",

(usually about a paragraph 2- although I can write to the see all on discord) \n\nto be honest, I don't really have an exact plot, but I know I want to use this character and I'd prefer some romance in the chat and to do MXM in that. I could do MXF although MXM is just a preference. it really depends on the plot and what you're looking for! (I'd like to come up with something together this time!) \n\nwe could do something with the shell shock clinics that were developed later on after the war, with Y/C also being a patient there or working there. I don't expect any of the roleplay to be super historically accurate and with this, I'm completely fine with some modern understanding of psychology although I would do more research on the historical aspect because I've only done a fair amount and I'd want to do this subject justice! honestly, I think this really could be interesting as I've always been more interested in the aftermath and 'what happens after the war' of roleplays rather than fighting. \n\n I am a semi-literate - literate writer and I write in 3rd person and without \\* I'd prefer if my partner could write the same length as I can!

The farm was his pride and joy until the great war began in July 1914 where he was 19 years old and began looking for volunteers. vincent immediately signed up for the army and into the highland light infantry and off to France he went! He has always enjoyed art, it's a pass time of his and he always has some sort of small book shoved haphazardly into his uniform- and some sort of pen or pencil. he is about 5'4, slim, a little more on the underweight side of the scale although he is fairly strong from working at a farm his whole life. He has bright blue eyes and very pale, freckled skin. freckles splattered across his nose, cheeks, etc etc, although he of course has some elsewhere. he has chin-length dark curly hair which is usually tied up haphazardly at the back of his head.",

My name is Cj im a trans man. sadly I\u2019ve fallen off Rping but now I wanna get back into it.  Im a decently experienced writer, I usually write a paragraph or two unless im writing the starter it tends to be a few paragraphs. \n\nIm usually up to any kind of rp, but I cannot do extremely dark rps, I do like angst but too much can be overwhelming. I like to include mental illnesses since it adds character.\n\nSome things that im interested in right now. \n\nRomance\n\nCyberpunk stuff\n\nHorror ive been listening to the creepy podcast and well I have never done a horror rp. Its worth a try.\n\nAngel and demon,(opposites are fun)\n\nGreek myths(like a reborn greek god and human etc.)\n\nGod and human etc.\n\nIm pretty flexible too so if you have any ideas shoot em at me,we can work together to make something that we\u2019d like.\n\nConsidering lgbt+ your character can be a trans man or other masculine genders and they can be Gay, Bi, Pan etc. except straight( and lesbian but that\u2019s obvious) since I\u2019ll be playing a man as well, sometimes I\u2019ll play as a trans man but ill ask you first if your comfortable with it. Variety is very good to have go all out with your characters make them unique~ \n\nI can do first or third person but im a little rusty at first. I will ask you questions related to first person thats just a preference thing.\n\nNo one word replies.\n\nPlease no extremely feminized men, I have nothing against it. It just rubs me wrong if you really want to make one please add a personality instead of being bratty and what not.\n\n\nPlease help with the plot, ill help as much as I can but I can\u2019t carry the plot the whole time.(Ideas are very welcome)\n\nPlease be 18 or older I would rather rp with my own age group.\n\nDiscord is the only app I use for rp.\n\nIf you have any questions please shoot me a message and not on the comments!

I write multipara responses when roleplaying, and am looking for a literate guy that can do the same.\n\nThe roleplay I am currently interested in doing takes place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and will start at the beginning of Infinity War, where Loki meets his demise on a ship carrying Asgardians, just after Ragnarok. \n\nMy character is a half-human, half-J\u00f6tunn (Presents as human, like Loki does) that was raised and resides in Midgard (Earth). Because of her heritage, she aged much slower than a normal human, but still faster than most J\u00f6tunn. She was born in the early 20th century, and presents as a young adult during the time of Infinity War/Endgame.\n\nHer J\u00f6tunn blood also gave her strange powers that caused her to have to isolate herself from the outside world. One night, as she slept, she had a premonition of an Asguardian\u2019s death by the hands of a Titan, and the events that followed it. When she woke, she knew she had to find a way to save this man, and prevent the events of her dreams from happening. \n\nShe and Loki form an unusual alliance with the Avengers, in hopes of saving their reality.\n\n\nIf you\u2019re interested, feel free to let me know about any questions or (minor) changes you\u2019d like to make. As soon as we have everything out of the way, I have a character description and starter ready to go :))\n\n.",

            "selftext": "Hey there! I'm Jim, kind of rolling back into writing after dying for a bit. And a good way to get back into the swing of things is to expand on a world I've been working on even further.  \nA world where humans and monsters live in harmony...in a way. They can go to the same school and stores, live in the same neighborhood, if you ignore all of the tension you'd think everything is peaceful. Your neighbor could be a dragon or your teacher could be a werewolf, there are many different kinds of monsters.  \nMy plots in this all take place in the same large city known as Hayop, characters from one plot can bump into others, so that's fun. The kinds of things we can follow are;\n\n\\-A human that goes to a monster school, who struggles with fitting in and growing up now that he's a senior. (You would play a new kid, either a human or monster coming from a mostly human populated area)  \n\\-A young bull monster running away, wanting to discover himself as his siblings try to get him home (You would play a human or monster, depends on you)  \n\\-A detective searching for a murderer, desperate for closure for his family and his sibling's families. (You would play a monster, though a human could work here as all)  \n\\-Said murderer running from the detective, trying not to get caught (Human or monster could work here)  \n\\-A human being force to get a dorm with a monster, simply wanting to get by in life (you would play the monster)\n\nOR if you'd like to to make your own spin on one of these plots, or you'd like to throw your own plot into this universe, let me know! This is a fun journey for both of us, let's both put something into this.  \nI write in 3rd person, present tense, and I'm literate. I'd probably start with a bunch of paragraphs but average one or two after we get comfortable. ALSO all of these plots can turn into romance, if that's what you'd like it to lead to then let me know. But this isn't all about romance, this is about exploration and getting to know these characters.  \nIf you're intereseted or have any questions, message me and I'll send you my discord! :D",

            "selftext": "Hey thanks for taking the time to read my post. I don\u2019t post here very often so sorry in advance if my post seems out of the usual format on this subreddit.\n\nAnyways, with halo infinity around the corner I figured I\u2019d get a head start on getting my Halo fix by attempting to start a long term rp set in the Halo universe.\n\nAs for an rp I\u2019ve always wanted to try a story that features two spartan head hunters. Similar to noble six prior to joining noble team, our characters would\u2019ve functioned as ONI\u2019s personal head hunters during the human/covenant war. Lone operators that work in the shadows to eliminate high valued targets in both covenant and rebel ranks. That is until the war against the covenant takes a turn for the worst with the loss of Reach. As an act of desperation ONI comes up with the brilliant idea of combining two of their most lethal assets together to form the beginning of a new spartan team to replace the famous Noble Team. A premise that sounds good on paper yet backfires as our characters struggle to even cooperate with each other as a result of years operating solo.\n\nIt\u2019s a rough plot I know but I think it has potential. And I\u2019m hoping now that someone on here thinks the same. And together we can work to improve it or we can create something new entirely. I\u2019m pretty flexible when it comes to developing an rp.\n\nA little about me if you\u2019re interested.\n- I\u2019m 21\n- I\u2019ve Roleplayed for about 5-6 years off and on.\n- I strongly prefer to rp in the third person past tense \n- My posts can range up to several paragraphs depending on what\u2019s needed for the situation.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested go ahead and shoot me message. I should get back to you very soon.",

            "selftext": "The first snowfall of the season was quite a strong one, covering the frozen forest with a layer of white fluff. Sparkling flurries fell faster as the winds picked up. For the most part, the forest was empty... except for a man trudging through the nasty winter storm.\n\nLindo, the soldier sent to start the fight against an unknown evil was caught in the thick of the storm in the forest. His metal armor clashed and clanged with creeks here and there as it began to freeze over. His breathing became sharp as he took his two last steps before falling to his knees, the armor on the verge of being frozen solid from the hours of walking through the snowstorm. \n\n\"Is this why they sent me... to get rid of me? I'll just be another soldier lost in his travels.\" He told himself as he felt the frostbite eat away at his tips, the rest of the body to follow. \n\n\"I cant... I mustn't...\" In a last attempt to find a place for refuge during the storm, he reached back with his weak hands and pulled his sword out. He stabbed it into the ground to pull himself up with the support he had. Even with his optimism, it would take a miracle to save him from the storm, as the suit had begun to freeze over completely and the frost was reaching and creeping onto his skin.\n\n_______________\n\nHey everyone, Chris here!\n\nI was thinking I write up a little prompt based of a Fantasy setting and a snowfall. I then made it a little crazy with my character, the elven soldier named Lindo being close to death. \n\nId love for this RP to be a nice mix between a burning romance and an action adventure story against this unknown evil. The frozen forest is just where we will start and we can definately discuss what this evil is, be it a creeping infection/ corruption of the Land or a Dark Lord Emerging.\n\nI dont believe there is anything else i really left out of this post but there probably is. If you need anything else from me, just send me a lovely red or orange envalope and i can definately answer it. I hope to have a very fun and interesting RP with you guys! And as always, all my other prompts are open to RPing too so you can just go through my post history! Thanks for reading and hopefully we can start a fun RP!\n\n-Chris / u/FelixKold",

            "selftext": " \n\nI hope you had a pleasant Christmas and you are safe at home. \n\nIt\u2019s this time of the year, where I am again hopeful to meet someone to rp with!\n\nFirst of all, let me tell you something about me.\n\nI am 28+, female, from europe and I have about 15 years roleplay experience now. My very first rp was with my best friend back then for around 5 or 6 years. Not sure anymore, but something around that range.\n\nFrom there on I wrote occasionally with people, sometimes long term, but mostly short term- cause we all know it\u2026 people tend to ghost. Which is fine I guess\u2026 I get that we are all just humans and cannot stay invested in one and the same plot for 100 years, but after at least a month of rping together it just feels so\u2026 heartbreaking. At least to me. I get invested really quickly and for me it\u2019s kinda an escape from reality. It\u2019s okay if you are not like that, but then we probably don\u2019t match all too well anyways. (I really love my characters and try to keep them as canon as I can!)\n\nI have taken a little break after getting ghosted quite a few times and I think I found the problem?\n\nNow hear me out on this one.\n\nTwo people who don\u2019t know each other in real life try to come up with plots and what not. Now I\u2019m not a fan of god modding and all that, but I think some people only rp for those CLICK moments, where Character A kisses Character B and everything else is just a waste of time for them.\n\nI LIVE for the slow burn, for the H/C moments, for the drama in between, the love, the chemistry.\n\nSo if you agree with me on this one\u2026 I think we already match pretty well.\n\nPlots can get boring, we all know that, but please be aware that sometimes the plot might go into a complete other direction as we intended, or might get a little boring. Instead of leaving, help me fix it!\n\nNow I said already that I am looking for a long term partner\u2026 and I mean it. \n\nNot only a month or whatever, I would like to find someone who is willing to build a world with me. Who is not too passive about the plot and who falls in love with our characters just as much.\n\nI want to wait until the Characters fall in love, I want to see the chemistry and get hyped when they *finally* fall in love.\n\nNow I mostly do fandoms, cause the world there already exists. \n\nI have done it now quite a few times\u2026 build a world, make characters and put work into it, but then guess what\u2026 got ghosted.\n\nI get it alright. I\u2019m not perfect. I\u2019m far away from it\u2026 and I tend to make stupid mistakes too.\n\nBut if you feel like we could match, hit me up and I give you my discord!\n\nFandoms I crave: (we can also do ABO)\n\nSupernatural Destiel\n\nDC SuperBat, Todd/Grayson\n\nMarvel Stony, Stucky, Loki/Thor, Loki/Tony\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI probably did some grammar oopsies, whoever finds some, can keep them. Looking forward to your dms!",

I know these are older games but not enough folks appreciate Chrono Caross and with the FF7 remake i am hoping it will revive interest in RP for that setting. Hellsing RP is great as well. Possibly some Doctor Who or Vampire Hunter D plots. Also looking for Vampire RP, possibly a modern Dracula Type story or some other Vampiric plot.\n\nCentral time zone, on later in the afternoons till late at night. Im pretty laid back and like to chat and get to know people and share ideas. Been RPing for over a decade, post length varies depending on whats going on in the scene but i try and give at least three or so lines up to a couple or so small to mid size paragraphs.\n\nI am over 21 and therefore do not feel comfortable writing with anyone under the age of 18. I like my plots to include elements of adventure, mystery, romance, action, even some comic moments and a few slice of life-ish bits here and there to create a, hopefully, well rounded plot. I seek male characters to RP opposite my character, certain canons or ocs wanted. OOC i dont care what your gender is. I know life must be lived so i dont expect you to be on posting all day every day.\n\nCharacter info and a few plots available upon request. I prefer to RP on Discord so drop a note for me in DMs if interested.",

            "selftext": "DC roleplay- F4A\n\nI am looking for a RP with the character I present there, or I am also open to some a Damirae roleplay (I play Raven)\n\nI am searching for literate partners, who can answer with somewhat lengthy stuff. I tend to write a lot when passionate, and I don't expect you to write a novel, but one or two fleshed out paragraphs is always appreciated. \n\nSo, I have just made this character. She is my precious baby.\n\nI don't really mind which character you play - unless it's Batman, lol. It can also be an OC, but I was thinking about having her paired with someone from the \"hero\" side (Roy, Jason, Richard Grayson, Damian, a bat OC, you get the gist) - of course, there would be more to that.\n\nHere is the girl: (Pm me for more of her backstory)\n\nName : Laura Quinzel\n\nGender : Female\n\nSexuality : Bisexual\n\nAge: 23\n\nRelations: Daughter of Harley Quinn and the Joker\n\nAppearance: 5\u20193, a little more with combat boots or heels. She is thin, but certainly not frail. She is relatively strong and agile, which are the main reasons for her slender body. Her skin is relatively pale, almost olive. Her appearance is not special; from toes to neck; she could just be a perfectly normal young adult living her best life in Gotham. But her face definitely reminds you of two very well-known faces. She has very blond hair, that she inherited from her mother. They are very long, a bit wavy towards the end. Reaching a bit above her hips, she wears them loose or in a loose pony. The tips are a frosted green color, reminiscent of her father- and also of a very traumatic story. She has a chiseled face, a pointy nose and full, pink lips. Her eyes are a very vivid emerald color, and they reflect a slight hint of insanity and craziness. She does not wear a lot of makeup, per say, but cat-like eyeliner, lashes and a sparkly gloss are definitely in her musts.\n\nPersonality: Despite being the daughter of the -perhaps- biggest criminals of Gotham, she is surprisingly unlike them in most places. She has that slight hint of insanity both her parents carry, but certainly not on the same level. She has compassion for people -whether it\u2019d be victims or people she cares about. She has a good sense of humour, and she many, many times wished she could be a normal like girl. She does not trust easy for many reasons, and she has a hard shell to break through. She is very lost identity wise \u2013 she does not consider herself a villain, yet no one would consider a hero. And she is certainly not a normal citizen neither. She is easily triggered, by many things, and can be a bit violent when annoyed. She knows no other way to show her emotions than though violence and tantrums.\n\nBackstory: Daughter to the Joker and Harley Quinn, she was hidden away by her mother for many years. When she was around 9, the Joker found out about her and decided to chase her down and take her under his wing, for all the wrong reasons. He did not wish to be a father, or to be good to her in any ways \u2013 love was an emotion he had never felt towards Laura. He wanted to forge her into a criminal mastermind, a supervillain he could mold. She went through a lot of traumatic stuff that I cannot describe here but would be happy to develop through PM's. At 17, she was sent to Arkham after a failed mission, where she was left behind by her parents. Now, she's 23, lives in the worst part of Gotham and is a real mess.",

I\u2019ve been playing ac:valhalla, and I\u2019m obsessed with norse mythology, so I wanted to do an rp about it.\n\nThe Vargr Clan, though not well known, has fierce warriors that hold its homeland and the gods dearly. Amongst these warriors is a woman who has longed to be a strong and dangerous warrior since she could walk. Her father, the leader of the clan, has stopped her from achieving this dream, believing her to be too delicate. \n\nAs for you... Are you a fierce warrior in the clan? Or maybe you\u2019re the local v\u00f6lva? Whatever your role, Agata has taken a liking to you. Perhaps you two were childhood friends? Or maybe you\u2019re more recent friends. \n\nI want the romance in this to be slowburn and natural. I also want it to be FxF. \n\nThis is about vikings, so expect it to get dark and bloody. Just let me know what your triggers are so that I don\u2019t accidentally overstep.\n\nOnto the nitty gritty.\n\nSpecifications: I\u2019m semilit. I write one-three paragraphs, and I usually hit three in my starters. I write in first person, but can write in third person if need be.\n\nExpectations: I\u2019m looking for someone who can write at least two lines. As long as you try to match, I\u2019m fine. Have a decent grasp on grammar. Please try to catch mistakes before you post.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested, please send me a message. To make sure you read everything, please include the word tree in your message. \n\nThat\u2019s all from me! Have a good day/night!",

Personally, I usually write at least two paragraphs per reply, but if my partner writes five paragraphs, I usually do my best to match it. I have a few plots I really want to do: \n\n1. Hades x Thanatos from the Hades Game - I really love their dynamic in the game, and would love to explore it a little more. \n2. Any Greek Mythology based plot: Achilles and Patroclus; Demigod following a prophecy; Modern Persephone and Hades - I love anything greek mythology based. \n3. Supernatural world based world: I would love to engage with someone to create a world together and characters based in that world. \n\nI usually roleplay MxM so that's what I'm most comfortable with, but I'm always willing to try MxF, depending on the plot.\n\nMy potential rp partner will be 21+, and reply at least once every few days, and if they need more time, just let me know so I know I'm not getting ghosted! :)",

            "selftext": " Hi there! I am 29, female, and located in EST. I enjoy character-driven, angsty plots with plenty of character development. Some of my favorite themes to write about are finding a place of belonging, overcoming past trauma, and chosen families. I like fantasy and modern equally, and am up for slice of life too!  \n\n\nI strongly prefer LGBT pairings and am picky about who I will write mxf with. If you are specifically looking for MxF I am most likely not your match. Generally I only write these with other queer authors. I do a lot of purely platonic plots as well, though, and am totally up for a cast of multiples.  \n\n\nI call myself \u2018lazy lit\u2019. I am just as capable of a 3000 character monster post as a paragraph, and am on the lower side of that at the moment.  \n\n\nPlease no:  \n\\-cops  \n\\-anything to do with a plague or pandemic  \n\\-mafia/crime  \n\\-straight horror  \n\\-Toxic romance  \n\n\nThough I am usually up for rapidposting, I do have times when I am only up for a few times a day/week. I do expect some communication in the beginning, so if we just started an RP and I haven\u2019t heard from you at all in several days I\u2019m going to assume you lost your muse.  \n\n\nThere are times where I need to take a break from a specific story or from RPing in general and I expect my partners to be understanding of this. This is my hobby and trying to make it work is a very quick way to get me to stop RPing with you. That being said, I don\u2019t ghost people--if you haven\u2019t heard from me in a few days go ahead and reach out to see where I\u2019m at, I\u2019m usually pretty chatty OOC. If we\u2019re already RPing and you see me post an ad please don\u2019t assume this means I\u2019m no longer interested.  \n\n\nThis ad is for \\*\\*21+ only. If you are not 21+ please do not DM me.\\*\\*  \n\n\n\\*\\*Please, PLEASE provide me with either a plot muse or an OC and some idea of what you want to do with them in your DM, or I will ignore you\\*\\*  \n\n\nDiscord only. DM me to get my discord handle. Looking forward to hearing!",

            "selftext": "Hello, and thank you for reading this post.\n\nI've been thinking lately I want to do a \"cool\" RP with characters that would fit into an action movie, or vigilante style comic.\n\nInspirations such as John Wick, Black Lagoon, the Fast and Furious franchise etc.\n\nIt can even be a little futuristic with super soldiers like Halo's Spartans  or have a Cyberpunk spin to it.\n\nI just really feel like playing someone who fits into a genre like that.\n\nWe can discuss the overall setting together. If it's more modern I'll have my OC more human, if it's a Cyberpunk or otherwise futuristic setting I'll probably go more super soldier or cyborg.\n\nI can do small paragraphs for fast replies, or larger paragraphs for people wanting more.\n\nI prefer to RP in 3rd person.\n\nLet me know through a message or chat if you're interested.",

Please have knowledge of Hunter x Hunter, I\u2019d like to use OCs, I tend towards third person but I\u2019m flexible in that regard. I\u2019ve been roleplaying for a couple years now and I usually do multipara but as long as you\u2019re trying to contribute to the roleplay I\u2019m perfectly fine. I\u2019m not against things getting nsfw at points but I\u2019d like the main focus to be on the characters and their lives as Hunters. We can discuss plot hooks and character specifics over discord so please message me on here somehow if you\u2019re interested and thanks for reading. Have a lovely morning, day, evening or night wherever and whenever you are!",

If we go the MMA route, we could use some kind of dice mechanic to resolve fights to keep things interesting.  I\u2019m completely open to your story arc ideas and would love to brainstorm together. \n\nIn terms of NSFW content, I would like to include - however it can\u2019t be the sole focus over plot and your character\u2019s development.   For NSFW content, would be happy to tailor to your tastes.  \n\nGenerally I like to use Discord, just to keep character profiles, pictures etc all organized. \n\nI\u2019m available sporadically throughout the day and moreso in the evenings (EST) . In terms of style I prefer third person with 1-2 paragraphs. \n\nIf this sounds like something you\u2019re interested in please send me a DM or chat so we can discuss! \n\nThank you in advance.",

Which to me isnt much to ask\n\nIm obviously much more into the gritty with a exciting story type of rp.\n\nPlease note these roleplays often require being able to play more than one character. Or if you prefer to take a more \"Dm role\" that can work too\n\nROLES Please note these are vague descriptions. So dm me to read full thing (please don't ask me to choose, these are listed because i like them, i can post all but that will be alot of reading)\n\n1. alternative wwll history\n\nFollowing the military after the end of a alternative WWll you are recruited into a top secret mission to assist in a mission that takes you through occupied europe, something is off about your commander as well as the mission itself- giving you the choice to abandon your post, or follow through\n\n2; mild science fiction modern roleplay\n\nIn a place where both Humanoid and humans live separately within the same society, and yet now you head to the heart of these peoples home... a place called South city, one of them an assassin for hire; and you have need for her talents, or perhaps you are unfortunate enough to be the one to face her. (This role is one requiring you to be able to play various characters rather than just one main, the story follows a modern day soviet russia, the lives of inhuman people and what happens next)\n\n3. Apocolyptic\n\nBased in a war gone hot and leading the world into ruin where survival is dictated by one owns initiative, there are no laws and life is short. And while many simply want to rebuild a life many still fight amongst themselves over empty wastelands and non-existent power. The humanoid soldiers who many blame for these events wander amongside us now, and yet theyre the few who can survive what the world has become\n\n\nDM ME WITH ANY QUESTIONS AND THE ROLE YOU WANT MORE DETAILS ON\n\n[SERIOUSLY dont comment cause i probably wont see it]",

Specifically fandom roleplays but if the idea is interesting enough I will do an oc x oc roleplay but I am picky. \n\nI\u2019ll start with my fandom ideas. I\u2019m mainly looking for a seven deadly sins roleplay or potentially something transformers or just symbiote based. I would appreciate it if you can play canon as I am a canon x oc roleplayer. I don\u2019t mind playing canon on the side or multiple characters but I do not play canon full time. \n\nAny other fandoms I have consist of: hellboy, blue exorcist\n\nOc based roleplays are a bit more tricky. I\u2019m a stickler for fantasy- specifically dragons. Come at me with a dragon plot you\u2019ll have a higher chance of getting me interested, even if it\u2019s \u2018weird\u2019. I\u2019m not huge on action or post apocalyptic and I prefer to come up with plots with my partner. \n\nNow if you\u2019ve gotten this far you\u2019re either interested or bored which I commend you to. Now let\u2019s get into the rules and such\n\nI am advanced literate! Please be somewhere similar. All I ask is 5 plus lines and to type cohesive sentences. It\u2019s all good being able to type 5+ paragraphs but if they\u2019re a garble of poor English and grammar then it\u2019s not exactly worth it. Same the other way around. It\u2019s one thing to type a handful of lines but what\u2019s the use of putting a lot of detail in to 2 or 3 lines. It seems counterproductive \n\nLimits wise. I can cope with most things. Furry? Cool- send me pictures of your fursona ooc unless were using them in the rp. Into some messed up things? Dear god give me a warning first. \n\nFinally- I have troubles in my personal life medically. Sometimes I am unable to reply to posts for a day or 2 at a time. If that\u2019s an issue let me know so I can warn you in advance if I feel as if I\u2019m going to hit one of those points. I\u2019ll appreciate any and all ooc talk as long as it doesn\u2019t overshadow the roleplay. \n\nThank you if you\u2019ve gotten this far! I hope to hear from you all soon.",

Drinking and jousting and enjoying the peace that had brought the large kingdom to great prosperity. But when news from the east came that a man was invading... with dragon, panic replaced joy. All except the king, who was certain that the castle would hold. Eventually it was put to the test, since their armies couldn\u2019t face the dragons in open fields, and for months it did. But food ran low, the royal family was told to escape. But all except two were cooked alive in the tunnels below the castle. The young princess and her young bodyguard\n\nNow it is 15 years later, the princess is now 23 years of age. She remembers some of what she once was but not much. Now, having taken refuge in an elven city where even the dragon master would not dare go, the once young knight decided it was time to reunite with her and convince her to go take the throne, which was hers by birthright. \n\nHello, hope you are doing well today. I roleplay on discord, kik, or in reddit chat. This can be a romance but obviously it doesn\u2019t have to be.

            "selftext": "\"You're a fool. But that's your strong suit, after all. Only a fool will tread where an angel wouldn't.\" \n\nI remember those words as if I'd just heard them. They were from my late emperor, during the assault of our nation. Was I a samurai? Pfft, I wish. I'd only talked to the emperor once before the assault. And that was to get scolded for my actions. I had managed to violate several rules during my training. Even though I didn't meet the requirements for a samurai, nor have the discipline of one. I was still trained alongside samurai. Now, our nation didn't have any *magical* ability or anything, as the others did. It made us look weak, no doubt. But our training was rougher. Better. They made sure to polish every soldier until two of them could fight until sunrise, then to sundown without getting a single hit into one another. Since we were at a disadvantage by not having any magic, we were trained to fight against all kinds of threats. Monsters, animals, magic, soldiers. You name it. Whatever it was, no matter how ridiculous, we trained for it. \n\nIt's a shame all the training went to waste. Our nations fell faster than anyone could ever expect. A nation of fire, the Oshija, had some type of destructive ability that completely wiped out our schools in the blink of an eye. Even to this day, I'm not sure what it was. A sudden blinding flash and the whole building was charred with anything inside turned to ash. It was a training day for all soldiers of the nation to properly test them, and see if they had to perhaps freshen up on their skills. A perfect moment to suddenly delete thousands of soldiers. I was expelled the day before. I won't get into detail, I just threw a tantrum. Either way, I was just waking up when I heard all the screams and horrifying cries of my townspeople. I jumped out of bed, reaching for my sword first. Quickly rushing out with it in hand as I watched fire shoot across the streets. In all sort of shapes. From dragons to arrows. I was heavily outnumbered, so I accepted the town's fate as I ran for the emperor's palace as quick as my naked feet could carry me. Hoping to rally with the remaining soldiers. \n\nI couldn't believe it when I arrived. The only person standing ready with a sword was the emperor himself. Staring me down as I made my way up those godforsaken stairs. Without a word, I positioned myself beside him. Ready to die, and all of that. As the enemy forces began marching closer, he looked at me. Saying what he said. Dishonorably, an enemy soldier shot him with a firebolt right on the spot. I couldn't comprehend how disrespectfully he was slain. I turned towards the enemy and charged forward. Suddenly, another firebolt. This one, way smaller. It hit me center mass as I was launched back up. I'm not sure what happened thereafter. I awoke a few hours later, with every building in sight on fire around me. I took my now dead emperor's sword and Wakizashi. That is why I carry two blades. I intend to sometime avenge him. Though I had hate for him, I still respected him. And this dishonorable kill wouldn't sit right with me.\n\nIt's been two years. My nation has been forgotten. So much so that I even can't recall its name. But what I do remember, is that I, Tsuyoshi, won't rest until he is avenged. \n\n\"Sake, cheapest you've got.\" A patron said to the bar's owner as he quickly pulled up a small glass to fill with some Sake. \"Five yen.\" The owner said, as the patron already had it ready. Slapping the coin on the table as he instantly downed the shot. Standing up to regroup with what looked like his friends. Tsuyoshi adjusted his straw hat, as he made his way over to take a seat of his own. These lands were still unknown to him. He had no idea which nation had control of these towns, nor did he know whether the people in them were welcoming to strangers. \"Sake,\" Tsuyoshi said. Even though a straw hat was rather wide, Tsuyoshi liked acting like some mysterious figure. Keeping it low, to hide a good portion of his face. Only letting his mouth and jaw show. Though, he did have a beard that complimented that style very well. \n\n\"Ten yen.\" The owner let out, preparing another glass as he'd hold the Sake ready in his left hand. Tsuyoshi didn't bother to haggle or complain. As he simply chuckled, slowly reaching for a coin from his pockets as he'd lightly tap it against the table. The owners quickly slid the money to his side as he'd pour the glass. Tsuyoshi slowly reached for it. Lifting it to his mouth before a sudden light push came from his left. \"Hey, strangers have to pay a toll to drink here!\" A rascal yelled out. Tsuyoshi didn't bother turning his head as he slowly put the glass down. Then again, another push. \"You deaf or somethin'? Pay up!\" \n\n---------\nHeya! I'm interested in doing a little Feudal Japan/Fantasy type thing, as I'm sure you gathered! Besides what I've written out, everything else is up in the air! I'd also be interested in this roleplay to involve some romance, later on. Though I'd heavily prefer it to feel natural.\n\nI don't have many requirements. Just that you're semi-lit, and try to keep to at least one paragraph. I usually keep around 1-3, myself. And please be 18+! And for pairing, MxF preferred! \n\nIf you're interested, please send me a message with your character or a continuation of the prompt already written out! And please don't send me a chat prefer you use messages, as I most likely won't see them.",

Now it is getting near unbearable and I\u2019d like to find someone to try role playing with for a while.\n\nLooking for someone who can play a pretty convincing Jack for my Timelady character. \n\nTo preface: the characters have been good old time friends for a long time and Jack had a sort of infatuation and crush on her. My character has been obsessed with the Doctor for way too long and no matter how much he hurt and left her, she never let go and this upset Jack. They adventured together with the Doctor and his companions for a good long while. It was a long time before they saw each other again, but this time he offered for my character to join Torchwood\u2014 much like how Martha did (In my own head of the story universe I created, this friendship/relationship is cannon in the universe)\n\nIf anyone needs any extra info, just DM me and I can send my character sheets and reference art. And if interested, I will send my Discord ID to whoever I choose.\n\nI\u2019m a pretty heavy lit role player and love dialogue that is built like a story. Detail is one of my favorites to incorporate in my writing.",

But first, I'll say a few things about myself -\n\nPeople call me Aless, and I don't mind any pronouns!\n\nMy timezone is EEST, but most of the time I'm active, and I'm also a night owl; Thanks to my insomnia. I usually roleplay on Discord, but if you don't have that platform, I suppose I wouldn't mind roleplaying on Reddit.\n\nI'm extremely descriptive! I can write up to three/four paragraphs or more; So, I'd appreciate it if I could receive responses with at least five lines! I'd try to match as well of course - since I'm well aware the length of my responses can be quite exhausting.\n\nI'm pretty much flexible and don't mind if the roleplays contains some dark themes.\n\nI have a few requirements if you wish to be my roleplay partner;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- People get busy, lose interest, etc, however, I would much rather tell me straight forward what's holding you back from replying instead of ghosting me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Please have proper grammar and spelling, I struggle with them as well, but if I can't understand what you're typing, then there's a problem.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I want you to be a bit creative! Don't just say 'I'll roll with whatever' because I want you to enjoy this roleplay, so if you desire to verbally express your ideas, plots, concepts, then feel free to do so!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Make a short introduction when you'll message me. If you'll just say 'hi' I'll most likely avoid it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, onto the plot!\n\n&gt;!So, M/C has a wealthy and successful company, her father is gonna retire soon - But instead of letting his daughter take over the company for sexist reasons, he decides to arrange a marriage so someone else can take over the company. However, Y/C's family only agrees for the sake of having money and power. M/C feels trapped and controlled; as her father chooses her future, what is gonna happen between M/C and your Y/C? Will their families' wishes come true and the arranged marriage will go through? Will M/C forever be controlled by her father as Y/C took over the company which they probably didn't even want? Only time will tell...!&lt;",

            "selftext": "**This roleplay will take place on Discord and include mostly realistic historical themes. This could include old-world concepts that would seem bizarre or offensive by today's standards, so please only consider writing with me if you're interested in a (reasonably) realistic setting!**\n\nHello! I am a 21+ Male living in America. I've been writing, independently and cooperatively, for a significant portion of my life and I've also developed a strong love for historical settings, primarily that within Europe, Colonial America, and the Mediterranean. That's not to say I'm an expert! In general, I would say that I am not nearly as knowledgeable as someone attending university for history, I'm just a guy who loves to learn.\n\nI also write as a GM (or DM, for you tabletop players)! I can clarify for some people if necessary, but this means that I take on the role of a narrator while you control a single character, and I play the world (and all other characters) around you. It's a bit like having your own text-based RPG!\n\nToday, I'm looking for a partner to write within the Assassin's Creed Universe. Even if a person is unaware of the lore of these games, that's okay! Fortunately, the AC lore is pretty much subjective to the setting and it could all be introduced organically through writing. But to clarify: I am looking to achieve a story within a historical setting primarily! I would also like this story to be Assassin's Creed oriented however, and the two compliment each other fairly well, as the franchise's success has shown.\n\nHere are some settings which I love:\n\n* Renaissance Europe (France, Italy)\n* Industrial or Post-Industrial Europe (England, Russia)\n* Fascist Italy (WWII)\n* Jerusalem / Levant (Crusades)\n* American Western Expansion (Post Civil War)\n* The Cold War (America / Soviet Union)\n\nFinally, I will state this: I am looking for *at least* one response per day, but I would love as many as three or four. I can't promise that I will respond that often every day, but I aim to get out several, high-quality posts every day that I can.\n\nIf you're interested, please let me know!",

We meet a week or two before to do some training and get on.\n\nAfter flying out to the capital of the country we'll work in, we change to a tiny twin propeller plane. There's just us two, the pilot and a stranger. As we fly an hour, two hours over the sea to the final destination, the engines start to splutter. I look in your eyes and see fear.\n\nI wake up injured and still inside the plane. The flames threaten to engulf us. I'm able to carry you out just in time before the fusillage explodes, leaving no other survivors. It's just us. \n\nOver the next few weeks, we manage to survive, becoming closer. We wait in vain to be rescued. Eight months pass before a helicopter arrives. By then, I'm a lot more muscular. You are two but your stomach is a lot bigger with our first child. \n\nI'd love to play out our survival and our we react to our pregnancy and the subsequent events. Over 18s only",

Particularly, I'd like to play out the MaeBea ship, with myself as Mae and my partner as Bea.\n\nI would also appreciate it if my partner was multipara and could play multiple characters. This rp would also have the supernatural elements that NitW had, because I personally find it hard to do strictly slice of life. \n\nPlease DM me if this sounds good to you! Much love, and have a great night, fellas.",

It is irrelevant, unimportant, it's just how the information is manifesting itself. Or rather, the ability. The gift. The magic. The unique skill. Whatever you want to call it.\n\nThe one who wrote this is _you._ Me. Us. It doesn't seem right to say us, you are me. A single entity. A single entity separated by time. You know what? Time travel. Yeah, as close as it does get. Unfortunately, I cannot really go back in time. Or you. No, all I could do is establish a stupid information highway connecting to the past.\n\nHur-hur-hur, I hear you say that's amazing? Yeah, _real_ amazing. So amazing that this would be turned into a single beep sound if broadcasted on television, so amazing I am just about to curl up in a corner and cry.\n\nEveryone else gets what? A magical sword that can cut thorough steel? A magical gift for releasing fireballs? A summon for some sort of undying minion? Yeah, and me? I get the ability to talk to useless little me. Woo!\n\nToughen up buttercup, the smelly brown pile that isn't chocolate is about to hit the fan on a global level - and you died six times now. I died six times. We, me, us - whatever. Dead. This is the seventh time.\n\nWhy are you so stupid, me? You survived for a whole year before! Now? Six deaths! Once you died after squatting in the bushes for nature calls, god ... How can someone be _this_ pathetic? How did I even survive a whole year?\n\nBuckle up buttercup, long story short.\n\nApocalypse. _Tomorrow._\n\nYeah, you thought the rona' was the end of the world? Tough luck, half the planet died from the last two plagues in the past four months and whatever is still alive is _just_ about to follow them. I think Russia ended up exploding a week ago, the whole place, _boom._\n\nAnyway, _I_ died six times. We. You. Us. It is _really_ annoying to talk to yourself, like ... I mean _really_ annoying. God, why are you so annoying to talk to, me?\n\nI'll keep it short. Well, I think is already well past short anyway. But doesn't matter, you'll need this.\n\nTomorrow, there will be the descent. Don't ask who dubbed it that, because everyone sort-of agreed to call it that. _Descent._ It is what it is. The descent of the apocalypse, a descent into madness, a descent into ... anarchy. Death. Suffering. Misery.\n\nFantasy world collision. Fiction turning to reality. And not the nice kind of it. People are dead. Day one headcount is several tens if not hundreds of millions. Some nations just were completely eradicated by the end of the week.\n\nPeople got tools for struggle.\n\nSome got special abilities. Some got special dynamics. Classes. Magic. Weapons. Minions. Anything vaguely referenced in fiction cropped up here.\n\nYou ain't getting anything.\n\n_Everyone_ else is. Know what you are getting? Me. You are getting me. Yourself. Help from someone that died six times, the only help you'll get is talking with snarky little me while suffering thorough ... _this._\n\nWonderful, ain't it? Yeah. Real nice. Now please, don't do the same thing that you've done in your last six iterations and live.\n\nI need you to make it for a year, then we can talk. I am better then you, at least I've been told I only died four times to make it to a year. In fact, make it for a week at least. It's so stupid, maybe this time you will tell me what killed you a week in when everything is just _weak._\n\nNow.\n\nDon't die.\n\nTalk you tomorrow.\n\nMaybe spend your money.\n\nWon't be much value left to it after tomorrow.\n\n((this will be purely in character, avoid OOC comments unless absolutely necessary, I am fine discussing this before, but I'd rather avoid having OOC comments scattered.\n\nLong story short, we play the same person in an apocalyptic setting. We can talk to a future version of ourself. Or rather, you to me. It's a string, one to the back, one to the front, always a years gap.\n\nPseudo time-loop esque story, playing with ourself and our future version. Note that I am male, but for this I will play \"female\" as we are the same person.))",
