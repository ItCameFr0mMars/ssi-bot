            "selftext": "*Hi! you can call me Juni.*  \nFor a bit of context, I'm an extremely new 13-year-old RPer. I'm a slow typer as well so my responses may take quite a while, I can't reply on the bat by the way, unlike most people. I don't have a preference for a partner, as long as we can both scratch our backs without any problems I'll be happy! ( \\^\u203f\\^\u273f)\n\nI use the following to RP: discord, literally just discord\n\nAnyway, I'm assuming you're here for the RP ideas, so here are the small jotted ideas I've had.\n\n    IDEA 1 BELOW\n\nwell the idea is a society that is broken into different parts, 'protagonists', 'side characters', 'antagonists', 'villains,' etc. protags and villains were destined to go on adventurers, have heartbreaks, etc. side characters were supporting cast and antagonists help the protags reach their goal. you can diagnose in early life if your child is a protag, villain, etc. but each protag is different, they can be mute, shy, have a bad guy to good guy arc, etc. everyone with higher roles divers.\n\nbut there is one person, someone that has been ruled as a 'background character' that wished to break the system. to destroy these names each person is given. to show everyone that you don't have to play by the rules.\n\ncan they succeed?\n\n    IDEA 2 BELOW\n\nidea 2 is a bit fantasy-like, your character falls asleep after a crappy day only to wake in a blank white room, seemingly endless. that is until you stumble upon \\[insert a character here\\] and slowly throughout bonding, you find out that whatever they feel or think is reflected into the said blank room. (ex: if they are sad, it starts raining)\n\nbut just as they start to develop feelings you are pulled back into your dark, unhappy world called reality.\n\n    IDEA 3 BELOW\n\nthis idea revolved around a certain tree \\[insert character here\\] has gone to since they were a kid. they soon find out the tree is protected by a guardian due to its magical properties.\n\n    IDEA 4 BELOW\n\none of the final ideas revolves around a character that moved to a new eerie town that was unsettling at first due to the signs saying to not be outside once it turns midnight. \\[insert character here\\] ignored the signs.\n\nonce it hit midnight, and they were still outside, monsters they could only describe as 'Freaks' seemed to come out of the shadows. they were caught by one and brought to a 'freakshow' with 9 other contestants to go through unhumanizing and blood-filled events just to survive.\n\n    (\u273f^\u203f^)\n\nIf you got this far then thank you! I really appreciate you took the time to read them. If you wanna RP any of these ideas or use your own, please comment! I don't bite.",

            "selftext": "Hi! Name's Auri. I'm a 26F and  I\u2019ve been Rping for roughly 8+ years now on tumblr and Discord. I'm possibly looking for a Destiny 2 RP. \n\nGeneral overview:\n\n* First off, I\u2019m not into NSFW content so if we ever do get to that point in a thread, I would like for us to fade to black if at all possible\n* I would like for my partner to be at least 21+. No minors please\n* Please do not take control over my character(s). If there\u2019re NPCs roaming around, I typically leave them up to my partner for first dibs\n* I don\u2019t mind doubling if the situation calls for it\n* If you are not happy in regards to the thread, please tell me rather than go silent on your end. I want you to have fun as well!\n* I do have an office job about five days out of the week so replies may be a bit slow. If the delay is longer than about 3-4 days, I will let you know. I do understand there may be lulls in the thread as life can get rather hectic, especially now\n* I really don\u2019t mind romance as long as there\u2019s some chemistry between the characters. I typically RP as female characters so I\u2019m fine with FxM or FxF\n* I can send over any references and info on my characters!\n* I do mainly RP on Discord but I do have a couple side blogs on Tumblr\n* I may only take on one or two people due to work right now\n\nFor the thread itself: Unfortunately, I haven't played the Forsaken DLC and haven't really been on Destiny since the 2016 or 2017 Dawning, so it has been a bit. I wouldn't mind having the thread taking place during the start of the Red War. I've also been wanting to explore a potential romance between my Awoken Hunter and Cayde.\n\nIf you're interested, please interact with this post or PM me! Thanks for reading!",

I\u2019m looking for a partner for a longterm roleplay on discord to burn some of that time. \n\nThe general premise of the roleplay revolves around a vampire who survives being staked because of a condition called dextrocardia. This is means his heart is reflected to the right side of his chest rather than the left. If you\u2019re interested in that idea, you can keep reading for a more detailed description of the my character and the setting! :)) \n\nLukas Fischer had always been a sickly child. His family could not afford to care for him, so they signed him into the service of the Count of Tarmsworth, Fuchs. The Count was an eccentric man, and the people knew very little about him beside his constant desire for new help.\n\nWhen Lukas arrived, Fuchs saw potential in him and took him under his wing as his pupil. He taught him anything that he could about the world. These lessons soon expanded into subjects that existed outside of the reaches of a typical education. A year into his service of the Count, Fuchs revealed himself to Lukas as part of an unholy crowd as he was a vampire. Lukas did not shrink from this discovery and pleaded to remain by his side. Fuchs named him as his heir after this point, claiming him as his child in both the day and night.\n\nLukas was not turned until his 21st birthday as Fuchs wanted to ensure that he would not be trapped in a child\u2019s body. After he was turned, they left for a two year trip around Europe where Fuchs taught Lukas how to manage his newfound identity. They were trailed by a pair of vampire hunter\u2019s during this time who would eventually follow them back to their home. \n\nFuchs and Lukas were both attacked within the week they had returned. Fuchs was killed as expected when he was staked, but Lukas did not respond as expected when he was staked next. He managed to kill the eldest of the duo in the following chaos, but the second escaped as he was significantly weakened by his wounds. \n\nLukas burned the bodies, swearing to Fuchs that he wound avenge his death before tending to his injuries and gathering a small suitcase. He reentered Tarmsworth and rented a longterm room at the inn, claiming to be a traveler who has just lost his father. This is where the roleplay would begin. \n\nSome possible starting points for your character could be: \n-another hunter that had accompanied the duo\n-a resident of Tarmsworth \n\nI don\u2019t have any really solid ideas of what I would want from my partner, so I\u2019d love to hear what you had in mind if you\u2019re interested in my idea! :))",

Currently, the idea of a romance between Johnny Silverhand and a female V has caught my attention. However, I am more than welcome to the idea of other characters roleplaying in romance settings. I did put a NSFW tag because I\u2019m hoping to spice things up with them, but that\u2019s a convo for the DMs. If you\u2019re interested at all in playing a male or female V, that is completely fine as well! \n\nTypically, I will write semi-lit (3-5 sentences) at the least depending on the specific setting and interaction of the characters. Do not feel like you have to be very literate with responses, but I also require at least a semi-lit response. \n\nPlease let me know if you are interested! I\u2019d love to hear from someone, just send me a message and I\u2019ll give you my Discord.",

I\u2019d like this RP to have an evolving story which of course contains Sex but this shouldn\u2019t be the main focus of this RP. I already got a few ideas but I\u2019m also open to hear your suggestions. \nMy ideas are: \n\n1. The End of the Peleponnesian War:\n\nThe peleponnesian war between Sparta and Athen has just finished with Sparta winning it. The City of Athen was besieged and captured by the winning fraction. Your a young woman, your family is part of the Athenian upper class. You get arrested as you\u2019re trying to leave the City. \n\n2. Arranged marriage during the Crusades: \nI\u2019m a young knight and the upcoming emperor of Constantinople. You\u2019re father is the ruler of Damaskus. After we fought against each other during a long war, we prepare a peace contract, which includes an arranged marriage with me and one of his daughters. \n\nIf you\u2019re a fan of role playing and history feel free to text me. I either Rp on kik or here. I\u2019m looking forward to play with you. \n\nMy kik is jack20.12",

It's not like you \\*asked\\* for the surprisingly friendly stray cat to hop into your lap and make a home on your thighs. \n\nYou weren't gonna try and move a ball of claws and fur. \n\nThough you weren't Tastumaki who, floating in a gentle green aura beside you, three stories off the ground. Being on your balcony meant easy access for all manners of creatures it seemed, from cats to a green-haired ESPer. \n\nShe had her arms crossed, a less than impressed look upon her face. \n\n\"Yes, yes it is.\" You respond. Probably wasn't the correct response but, even after having her as a girlfriend, you couldn't easily predict her. \n\nAh, that's right, she's your girlfriend. And, her being your girlfriend, and you being one of the few people she can tolerate, she must have wanted to take the spot on your lap. \n\nOccupied by the gently snoring ball of fur and claws. \n\n\"...He might scratch me.\" \n\nThe eye-roll she gave could be heard for miles, as she brought a single finger up, wrapping the cat in the gentle green aura and pulling him off. The cat, of course, is less than enthused and scampers off as soon as the pressure around him is no more. \n\nWhat a shame, he was rather warm. \n\n\"There.\" \n\nTatsumaki is warmer you realize, deposited in your lap with barely any notice, one leg crossed over the other, back to your stomach. \n\nHeavier, but overall pleasant. \n\n...\n\n\"Hellooo?\" You blink, meeting the annoying glare she shoots your way, \"...Aren't you going to scratch me?\" \n\nAh. Was that what you were supposed to do? Well, she asked. A hand coming up, running through her green curls, much like it once ran through the stray cat's fur. \n\n\"Hmph.\" \n\nNo purring, but you don't stop. \n\nTatsumaki could be odd sometimes. \n\n...\n\nJust an idea and a kind of proof of concept for a strange request I have. I want to play the supremely powerful, acidic, and abrasive Tastumaki as she...engages in a relationship. Who she's with is up to you, OC or canon character, and the aspects of this relationship are up for us to decide! \n\nReally, playing Tastumaki is just a whole heap of fun. \n\nThe little drabble is mostly a little something I came up with. This doesn't at all have to explain their relationship dynamics, and you are not forced to continue from it!",

My requirements are that you be over the age of 21 (just for my comfort), and that your  replies are a bare minimum of a few lines at a time - enough to respond  to and progress the story. I'd like to be civil with one another but we  don't have to be chatty about our lives if it's out of your comfort  zone.\n\nI understand priorities and  won't hound you endlessly for replies, but I'll respond at least a  couple times a day on average and sometimes more. If you lose interest  at any point just let me know, I won't fly off on you.\n\nI'm  looking for either modern low fantasy supernatural or slice of life, or  anything that falls in some middle ground between the two. I have a few  previously hatched ideas and starting points in a google doc for both  that I will happily share. If you have anything you're looking for in  the realm of either listed category though, let me know and I'll  probably be down.\n\nI like to build a  story with my partner, so please be actively involved in that. Interests include drama, plot twists,  angst, and generally putting characters through the ringer, possibility  for a happy ending tbd.\n\nI prefer  to write females and I prefer to write f/m if things roll that way. I'm old school and I  don't usually provide a whole character profile breakdown before we  start, I think it's more fun that way. If you want to though, I'll read  yours no problem.\n\nIf I sound your speed then feel free to message me!",

            "selftext": "((Reminder: Very dark/sad intro, however I'm looking to explore a lighter/silly thing that follows upon it. Feel free to discuss this with me first of you want to explore it with alterations. A female lich would be fine too, pile of bones anyway.))\n\n_'Witch spawn, witch spawn! Burn this thing, throw it on the pyre! Throw it on the fire, let it burn! Burn! Burn to ashes! Burn where we burnt the mother of this abomination!'_\n\nThe mob was lould, wildly waving their tools about. Pitchforks. Shovels. Rakes. Some did carry torches, lighting up the night with their flickering shadows. In the darkness, they did resemble an amalgamation of monsters. A ravenous horde, out for blood and violence.\n\nDespite that, you could only watch them with a numb look. Watch this horde, this mob, slowly approach - it was this crowd that left you orphaned.  \n\n_'Should never have taken them in! These ... These things! They brought famine! They brought disasters! They are abominations, their sorcery is cursed!'_\n\nThe old auntie Melanie, she was the bakery lady. Always smiling. She always snuck in a sweet cinnamon bun for you, every morning, telling you to not tell your mother about it. It was a gift for a good girl that helped out at home.\n\nThe old grumpy Lloyd, he always was a bit grumpy. He was a butcher. He always did \"mess up\" the calculations when it was about giving change, you'd always come back home with a few extra taels.\n\nThe lazy carpenters, the twins Hannah and Henry, they had justified that fixing up that rotten fence surrounding the cabin was a good idea for the whole village, they didn't take a penny - that's why rodents wouldn't end up stealing the tomatoes anymore!\n\n... There were more people. In fact, some of the people weren't much older then her. A few of them were the ones that'd play with you, Jennie was the one who still sulked. It really had annoyed her that you were much better then her at jumping rope, she always challenged you to a rematch every morning saying that she'd win today.\n\nAnd tell you what?\n\nThese people were the ones screaming the loudest, their voices were the most hoarse, their eyes were blood shot, they were just a little short of frothing - the crowd didn't even look at you like a human being.\n\n_'It.'_\n\n_'That thing.'_\n\n_'Abomination.'_\n\n_'Creature.'_\n\n... It had been a mistake. Such a horrible and miserable mistake. Cheering up that little girl, showing her \"something beautiful\" - the only magical art that your feeble capacities could bear. You weren't talented at magic, it was strenuous.\n\nWith ragged breathing, breaking into sweat, and a dull throbbing headache you had just barely pulled off the \"butterfly breath\" - just a magical breath into your cupped hands, which then spread out into glowing magical particles that illuminated the surrounding area.\n\nIt was meant to cheer up a tearful younger girl that tripped and scratched her knee up.\n\nIt wasn't meant to be this.\n\nIt wasn't meant to make everything fall apart.\n\nIt wasn't meant to kill your own mother.\n\n_It was just meant to put a smile on a crying girls face._\n\nSuch a shame, this time round nobody was there to wipe off the tears of the crying girl.\n\n... It was a blur afterwards.\n\nShoving around, people bickering, someone striking you across the face, some laughter, afterwards ... you were thrown somewhere.\n\nBut not the pyre.\n\nIt was hard to figure out why, a hundred voices, overlapping, screaming, laughing, yelling - you couldn't figure out what was their reason. But at the end of it, you didn't burn on the same pyre as your mother had.\n\n_'You are such a silly girl, mama is sorry.'_\n\n... She hadn't said goodbye. Just shaking her head, forcing a smile - the memory that followed, you forcefully shoved away. Your fragile mind locking away memory, though there wasn't much of a benefit from it.\n\nThese once bright eyes, they had already turned dull. Zombie like. Hollow. Numb. It was like a house collapsing, and someone saving a tile from the roof - yelling that the roof is gonna leak with a broken tile.\n\nAfterwards, they just threw you off the edge. There was a cliff, a branch of the abyss. The dark rift that spread across the continent, it was the \"fracture\" between a world full of heinous and evil abominations, teeming with undead and demons.\n\nThey just kicked you there, for whatever reason it was. Maybe so they wouldn't have to burn a child. Maybe so they wouldn't have to deal with your ash. The reason, it didn't matter all that much. Death one way or another - if the fall didn't kill you, these things below would.\n\nOr should.\n\nYet ...\n\n_\"How curious, a human child ...\"_\n\n... it wasn't.\n\nThe fall, it hadn't inflicted harm upon you. The bruises were from the people above, yet the fall itself hadn't inflicted harm. But in the depths of the dark rift, surrounded with thick fog and distant silhouettes ... The girl found compassion in the strangest form.\n\nA ragged skeleton. White bones. A loose robe. A dark robe. Hollow eye sockets. A ghostly green flame. Fleshless hands, but surprisingly smooth finger tips that lightly dragged over her face.\n\n_\"Child, what brings you here? Didn't your people tell that you shouldn't roam the edge of the cliff?\"_\n\nThere was something eerie about the hoarse voice, it sounded like the gyrating of metal with occasional clicking and clacking mingled in-between. A voice that truly did befit the reputation of scaring crying children into silence.\n\nHence, marked the meeting between a lich and a human child ... Even if rejected by her own kind.",

I mostly would like it set in the 2003 version but I am always up for AU\u2019s or different settings. As this is a fandom I am totally fine with doubling and would ask you to do the same. I would like it to be romance focused with the additional angst and drama. \n\nWhat I would like from my partner.\n\n* As someone who is over 18 I ask that both my partner and all characters involved be likewise over 18. Additionally when messaging me please confirm you are over 18. \n* More than one sentence please, just something to work with.\n* Please use third person.\n* I would really like my partner to play Raphael.\n\nIf you are in need of a writing sample I have some. I would love to brainstorm and come up with some cool ideas with you! Really hope to hear back from anyone interested! Please message me as sometimes I don\u2019t get the messenger notifications.",

Colonies and cities have been established all throughout the solar system, spanning from Mercury to Pluto.  Each had their own system of government, separately functioning from a main governing body.  Few inter-spacial laws apply to every planet, leaving much room for loopholes and shortcuts through the political process.  Some planets, like Pluto, have little government presence, while others, like Neptune, have an almost Eastern-like aura surrounding it.  \n\nBounty hunting has become a warmly-accepted job, along with a multitude of other formerly-illegal occupations.

            "selftext": "Okay! I posted something recently and had a ton of hits. At the end of the day, I settled on one partner for a post apoc setting. This is totally irrelevant to this post, but I thought I'd share my excitement!  \n\n\nSomeone suggested to me that I should find one more partner for a high fantasy setting, so here I am! Will you be the partner I choose?! Hopefully!  \n\n\nThe prompt will be simple at face value, but I promise it's a lot more complex than meets the eye. I also expect my partner to aid me in world building! This isn't just my story. It's our story :3  \n\n\nAnyone that contacts me, please be literate and capable of producing two paragraphs almost every post. There will be times where one paragraph is all that is necessary, of course. I am also all for multiple paragraphs! I myself post multiple paragraphs if necessary.  \n\n\nWarning! If you prefer heavily detailed and complex **magic systems,** I am not the partner for you. I play Dungeons and Dragons. I don't want to stress about magic details and feel limited by them when it comes to a text based roleplay. Thank you for understanding!  \n\n\nThe prompt:  \n\n\n**A woman in a full set of armor is hiring bodyguards to escort her to a distant land. She is paying handsomely, so that is more than enough to be the incentive!... Although not many would dare to take the job, as it requires a long journey.. And the destination? Extremely dangerous. Only skilled fighters and magic wielders will be able to survive the journey.**  \n\n\n**Whether or not the bodyguards she's hiring are fit for such a job.. Who knows? Some may be foolish enough to accept the job without having the skills necessary to escort the armored woman... Only time will tell.**  \n\n\nThere it is! Very simple, but it leaves LOTS of room for interesting and complex storytelling that we can work on together!   \n\n\nI hope to hear from you all soon so that we may discuss the details of the roleplay and get something started as soon as today! \u2661",

            "selftext": "This will be a very weird, but still very passionate roleplay. I had this idea after scrolling through a cute art on twitter, which I will send to you once we start. My prefered platform is Discord, since it's basically perfect, and a short term would be fine. But let's see where this goes. Oh, and third person is required.\n\nVery well. Since the boring stuff is already behind us, let me tell you what this is about. We would roleplay in a generic fantasy setting, in which your character is a monster slayer. Much like a witcher, with years of practice, always killing beasts without a second thought. However, this time he crossed a creature like no other he had ever seen before. A sphinx, the very last one of her kind. \n\nLiara has survived the purge of her own kind, and seen what happens to those who oppose to humankind. She opted to live isolated from other beings, deep withing the forest of Etterost, in a dark cavern. After a child went lost, peasants from a town a few miles north went looking for clues of the child's whereabouts, and found Liara's den.\n\nDespite the human's hostile reaction, she did not harm any if them. Liara ended up scaring them enough to make them retreat back to the town. The sphinx ended up wounded, and retrieved back to her cave. She was naive enough to think the peasants would ignore her presence.\n\nA monster hunter was hired, to take care of the creature who lurked in the woods, and whom they believed had killed the missing children.\n\n-//-\n\nLiara's lower body is one of a lioness, big and slightly muscled. From the waist up, she looks much like a female human, with ink black straight hair. For human patterns, her upper body would be considered beautiful, in a very unique way. Her eyes are blue, and despite her evident sorrow, her smile is beautiful, no matter how rare she shows it. Three crossbow bolts, shot by the peasants, are still lodged on her back, since she doesn't want to pull them off and risk making the wounds even worse.\n\n-//-\n\nIf you're interested, DM me with your intro.",

            "selftext": " \n\nhi! :D I'm looking for someone creative and open minded to rp with! I'm hoping to play a guy and I'm open to you playing literally any gender.\n\n1.\u00a0 Beauty and the Beast: One of our characters is the cursed, long isolated occupant of a grand lonely manor or castle that is shrouded in rumor and mystery.\u00a0 The other, perhaps a commoner, a runaway, a lost young man/woman... very open.\u00a0 They could be offered a kind bit of much needed hospitality or they could be forced to remain.\u00a0 Either way, feelings and character development happen and romance sparks... but not without dangers and challenges ahead\n\n2. Vampire: You felt like someone was following you, so you took a different route home, but the footsteps behind you seemed to only quicken and get closer.\u00a0 Desperate, you start running but get knocked down by some horrific looking imp with leathery skin and red eyes.\u00a0 Before it can dig its claws into you, a blade is rammed through its body and you pass out from the shock... you awaken hours later in a massive, lavishly decorated room and soon come to discover you are the guest of a very unusual individual \\[Roles can absolutely be swapped if you prefer\\]\n\n3. The little merman- You had an imaginary friend as a child when you lived with your kindly old Grandfather by the sea.\u00a0 He was a sweet boy who would swim with you and make you seashell necklaces.\u00a0 Life made it necessary for you to leave and the memory is hazy to the point where you think it might have been a dream.. but now that you've been able to return years later, you head down to the beach and swear you see a familiar boy.. \\[very fluffy cute one &lt;3\\]\n\n4. Of Princes and Dragons- a medieval based fantasy. Warring nations, knights, mythical beasts and legends nobody is sure is based off fact or not.\u00a0 During a terrible siege, the \\[Prince/Princess\\] is forced to run from the castle to escape.\u00a0 They are ambushed and just when it seems the end is near, a burst of flames and a sudden rush of leathery wings saves them.\u00a0 A young dragonkin takes the heir back to their den\n\n5. Witch/Warlock- One character plays a mysterious witch or warlock living alone or as an apothecary.\u00a0 The other can be a traveler, a knight, or even maybe some kind of half beast or demon who is in need of aid \\[injured or captive or something\\].\u00a0 I'm NOT looking for Harry Potter.\u00a0 More searching for Howl's Moving Castle/Mary and the Witches Flower kind of vibes\n\n6. Ghost romance- THIS ONE is one that I've thought about for a very very long time and it has lots of drama, sad stuff, mystery and action. Different from the others but trust me, its a plot that I've been cooking for a LONG time. - When you're in early in high school, there's a boy who you like well enough. He's moderately popular even though he's a bit rough around the edges and prone to fights, but overall doesn't have a horrible reputation... so when a notice goes home and everyone gets a day off because he committed suicide, you're just as shocked as everyone else. After a few years and graduation, a lot of people forget about it and so do you, but oddly enough you start to notice a certain familiar boy once in a while around campus\n\nLets have some fun! :D Thanks for reading!\n\nI am sorry but I'm only interested in Discord.",

You can feel them, instead of seeing them. Thinly, like a light from under a doorway, the people around you are felt. It was your gift...The Force, it was called. It let you move things, it let you do things someone normal could never do. \n\nIt was a gift, and yet, as you stand among the bodies of those \"gifted\" around you, you feel it is a curse. \n\nWhatever existence you had before was nothing compared to what was to occur. \n\nSome of those around you... from varying backgrounds. The poor, the hungry, the alien, those that the Sith considered worthless of any pity nor assistance. Unlike the ones with Sith blood running through their veins, or who had the power to make their admittance better.\n\n\"...None of you will survive.\"\n\nIt's the bored tone that chills you, along with your peers, locking eyes with him. He is a well-dressed man, an aristocrat with both the air and appearance of one. Thinly cut hair, sharply manicured beard, a chin that could cut glass and eyes that looked offended to even look at you. He was above you, above you all, and he knew it. \n\nHe brings an arm, beckoning the group to view the utterly harsh landscape that made up Korriban. Shuddered, rocky mesas and thin canyons, with sand so hot it would melt bone. Life was hard and the ones that survived were harder, stronger for it. Deadlier...and they slinked in those canyons. \n\nYou could see, vaguely, the brown sandstone speck in the distance. \n\n\"Oh sure, you'll survive in body, and perhaps in mind. But all who walk to The Crevices do not come out the same. The old you will die, and for some, you will always remain. For the rest...you'll be reborn. Worthy of attention. Of time. Make it to the Academy, or die.\" \n\n\"Until then, you are nothing to me.\"\n\nWithout a second thought, and a wave of his hand, one of the others was suddenly thrown off of the mesa, and died with an echoing scream. Overall? That made around thirty or so of your peers. Rejects, in the eyes of the Sith. \"I am Overseer Syndril, welcome to Korriban.\"\n\n\\-------\n\nThe Sith are always so interesting to talk about, honestly. I've had this in my head for quite some time and I'd like to get something going! I played a good majority of the Sith Warrior and Sith Inquisitor campaigns in SWTOR, and what I liked about them was simply...becoming more. In the Sith Warrior one, you can slowly build up a repertoire of contacts. In the Sith Inquisitor one, you reinvigorate your ancestors by upholding your unknown Sith Bloodline. \n\nThe writing above is mostly an attempt to set the stage, but I'm *more* than welcome to do something else with this, as long as it involves some Dark Side funsies and takes place in the SWTOR universe. I've got plenty more ideas if what I've said above doesn't suit you. If you have any questions please feel free to ask!",

            "selftext": " \n\nHowdy everyone! While normally I don't toss up an ad for this premise, it's something I'm specifically looking for at the moment.\n\n**I'm specifically looking for a GM.** I know that tends to be mean different things to people \\[As a couple months back I tossed up an ad for one, and nobody actually responded with interest being a GM, instead they assumed I wanted a 1x1 where they just design the world.\\]\n\nSo I'm specifically looking for a partner who can take that role on. That'd be you won't have a 'primary' character and would be writing for the world and most of the encounters. Kind of like being a DM for a game of DnD.\n\nThough don't worry, I'm more than happy to play a cast of characters as well, though my main focus will always be on my primary!\n\nI'm more than happy for you to have a cast of characters as well that are constantly involved, with some possibly even there the entire roleplay, though nothing is set in stone! I also don't mind the killing off of most of my characters minus my primary! Even if it's not asked in advance.\n\nLately I've gotten a couple 1x1's I'm happy with, and I'm not actively seeking another. So if you're going to message me for a 1x1 despite reading this, just know you'll be turned down. It's nothing personal, I'm just not looking for any.\n\nI would love for romance to be an option involved, in the case it is. Please note I only do MxF at the moment when it involves my primary character. Though for secondary characters and pairings I do pairings of all genders and sexualities!\n\nSo what am I looking for specifically?\n\nI'm open to a couple options! Both original world and fandom wise.\n\n**For original world**, I'm interested in all genres! From high fantasy set in a modern or medieval world, to something set in a much more cyberpunk tone! Realism or complete fantasy are both fine with me! I also historical and so much more!\n\nOf course I'm open to even more niche genres if you have any in mind!\n\nFeel free to bring any genre to the table, and I can pretty much promise you I'm game!\n\n**For fandoms:**\n\n\\- The Witcher \\[Specifically the game's universe, not the books or show.\\]\n\n\\- The Last of Us\n\n\\- Watch Dogs \\[Preferably akin to 2 or Legion.\\]\n\n\\- Something akin to the recent Tomb Raider games. \\[More inspired than actually part of the fandom\\]\n\n\\- Star Wars\n\n\\- Resident Evil\n\n\\- Devil May Cry\n\n\\- And possibly more! I'm more than happy to hear suggestions/requests!\n\n***About me:***\n\nA bit about me! I'm just your regular dude who enjoys camping, hiking, horror movies, coffee, and several other things, but I can tell you about that later! I'm currently kicking it in the east coast of the United States, which means my timezone is EST. I'm normally free any time after 2-4 pm \\[EST\\] from Monday-Friday. And then weekends I'm pretty active as well. When it comes to post length I tend to match my partner, so whether I'm giving 10 sentences or 10 paragraphs, I'm always able! I can do novella length happily! I'm 21 and have no triggers, and am willing to delve into more mature or sensitive themes, though if something is a bit much for me, I'll let you know.\n\nI love talking OOC with partners and generally try to keep a good friendship with them if they're down for it. I won't share any info about my real life, as I've had stalkers in the past. So if I don't show you pictures of myself, or won't talk about certain aspects, please don't be offended.\n\nI actually have commissioned art for A LOT of my characters, and am more than willing to show them! I also prefer to stick to discord when it comes to a medium/platform, but I'm more than willing to discuss other options. I will not use kik/telegram. Please don't ask.\n\nThanks for reading, **if you are interested, simply DM me!**",

We go on a cruise and have a good time and share room together (do a little sexual innuendos and realize how sexy we are etc). Then we reach the stranded island, filled with cyborg ninjas zombies and supernatural creatures. It was a pretty spot and beautiful during the day but at night that\u2019s when they come out and we didn\u2019t knew about it. Anyway we got distracted and forgot to get back on the ship thus leaving us. From there we must survive, fighting cyborg zombies and such, learn how to fish build, all while getting close and closer.\nAlso be able to play different characters and be literate.",

I understand mistakes and I don't really care if there are some small mistypos, but overall grammar and puncuation is needed.\n\n\\- I prefer roleplaying in 3rd person past tense, but I'm fine if you don't do that.\n\n\\- I'm fine with every NSFW topic you want, we all know what can happen during a war, especially in the Frontier. It's Slice of Life, but other themes or topics are to be discussed in DMs.\n\n\\- I only roleplay on Discord. Any timezone is good, I like to OOC as well! Contact me in DMs if you're interested!",

So basically, our characters are sent from our respective agencies on the same exact mission, for different reasons (which can be discussed later). However when they learn of each other, they try to destroy one another, but end up falling in love. After that it can go many different ways. The two could defect, hide their love. The list is pretty extensive. I am  hoping for this to be long term, but it can have a definitive end if that\u2019s more your style, I\u2019m always open to that! This would take place in modern times and be sort of James Bond esque. As mentioned above I would really like some romance in here, as it is most definitely a must. I am pretty laid back in general. I understand that it\u2019s a little odd, but if you\u2019re interested please let me know. As for me, I\u2019m advanced literate, RP in third person and on discord, or here on Reddit. Thank you, feel free to comment or dm me, whichever you\u2019d prefer",

While sad, I am trying to start the new year on a positive fresh note! Today I am hoping to find partners to double with- that is, I\u2019ll do your romance roleplay, and you do mine based around a fandom universe! My roleplay will be MxM for the time being, however I can do any gender pairing for your roleplay. While my post history probably gives some hints on what I\u2019m looking for, here are just a few that I would like to explore:\n\nFor my roleplay, I am craving the following:\nNinja Turtles (older)\nScott Pilgrim (comics)\nStar vs the Forces of Evil (older)\nDisney\n\nI have many more, however those are ones I have ideas for off the bat. You can run fandoms by me and I\u2019ll be happy to play your romantic scenario for you if I know it! Edit: I do not do Marvel/DC roleplays or fandoms with real life casts. Sorry, not really my thing personally! \n\nA bit of location/life information: my timezone is EST US time, and I work mornings every day except Wednesday and Sunday. On those days typically, I will be the most active, however I am virtually free anytime after 2:30pm. \n\n~Rules~\n1. Please be literate. No text talk or bad grammar (minus OOC chatting). 3rd person only. \n2. Please be relatively active. I understand we all have busy lives, however if you ghost or aren\u2019t around for long periods of time, I am not the partner for you. If you aren\u2019t feeling our plot or want to part ways, just communicate!\n3. I am 18+ and all participants and characters must also be 18+. \n4. Let\u2019s have fun and be friends! Let\u2019s chat OOC and talk about our days! As much as I love roleplaying, I love getting to know my partners as well! \n\nAnd I think that about covers it! If you\u2019re interested, please shoot me a PM and we can discuss specifics! Thank you for reading and I hope you have a wonderful 2021!",

If we did the AU route, I think it\u2019d WAY fun to have one of us play the avatar (not Korra, both OC\u2019s), have them both be from the Northern Water Tribe, and be practically attached at the hip, which is why it\u2019s so hard for their other when whichever one of us is the avatar has to leave for Republic City to train, and we\u2019ll think of more details in private. \n\nAnother idea that I thought would be WAY fun is a Jinora RP, set after book 4. It would definitely be an eventual romance with your character, whether it\u2019s a guy or a girl, and could have both action and slice of life.\n\nI\u2019m fine with NSFW elements as long as there\u2019s a lot of build up to that happening, and we focus on the story and characters more.

            "selftext": "  Hello! I am looking for a new RP partner. I am +18, and I enjoy action, adventure, and sometimes tragic roleplays, and I always love to add some romance into the mix.\n\n  At the moment, I\u2019m out of plot ideas, so, if you\u2019ve got an idea you\u2019d like to try out then let me know in a message. :) \n\n  You have to be +18.\n  I\u2019m fine with writing in first and 3rd person, just let me know which you prefer.\n  Do not control my character, it is really annoying.\n  Length of response, well... It doesn\u2019t really matter, but give me something to work with, but you don\u2019t have to write a novel. I usually respond with one paragraph, but that can change depending on what\u2019s going on in the rp.\n  I\u2019m not a fan of using photos and face claims in roleplays, so I\u2019m not doing that.\n  I\u2019m fine with nsfw but I don\u2019t want it to be the main theme of the rp.\n  Please no fantasy, paranormal, anime, or fandoms.\n  I only use discord.\n\nHappy 2021!",

People who are real and deep and have thoughts and a past and a present and hopes for the future.\n* Must roleplay with faceclaims (actors/actresses/models - no anime/cartoon/drawings)\n* Must be interested in building character aesthetics/share songs, inspirational gifs, pictures, pinterest boards ect.\n* Be committed. I want to grow these characters, give them full fledge lives and relationships. This won't happen in 3 days lol (aka looking for long term partner)\n* I write in 3rd person.\n* Reply length matters - but how often does not. You can expect at least one reply from me once a day. But I expect nothing from you so long as we keep in touch and there's no ghosting.\n* I like to build a relationship with my writing partner as well, it helps connect to the story! Let's be friends? Let's brainstorm, let's build!\n\nSend me a message with your ideas for this roleplay. What does the song make you feel? What kind of characters/ships are you envisioning?",

It was her meeting Five, her toying with his calculations helped him, she was the most beautiful creature he had ever seen and she was such a the most dangerous. \n\nHe wanted her, and he decided that maybe he can call in a favour.

Then I would like to alter this time by complicating things even further, add some romance, Five seeing her again just gives him more motivation to do what needs to be done. \n\nMaybe it turns out better this time. \n\nI only roleplay on discord, please message me if you are interested. I\u2019m looking for a partner who will write at least one paragraph (four lines or more) and had an understanding of the English language (I made mistakes all the time but if you spot them fix them). \n\nHope to hear from you soon.",

This will be your own character so have a bio and a picture of her and what color your saber is. I hope you\u2019ll like this!\n\nStarter:\nWe were on the planet of Hoth. I walked in our republic base wearing a jacket as i talked to the clones about the droids\u2019 location. I rub my chin and suddenly i felt some darkness in the force. A clone took aim at me. I grab my saber igniting my yellow blade as i took care of the troopers i was with. I kept my saber ignited as i run towards you. Once i was in the room where you were, i saw you already took care of the clones. \u201cWe need to leave\u201d i say quickly. We run towards the republic shuttle that brought us. We got in, me taking the pilot seat and you sat beside me. We took off and went into space. Once far enough from Hoth, i rub my face \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense, why did they try to take us down?\u201d I asked my self and looked at you. I check your body to make sure you were okay.

I honestly haven\u2019t roleplayed in a while but I thought it would be cool to give it a try again. I would prefer to go on Twitter but I\u2019m willing to try Discord or a different method if you want. \n\nI\u2019m a good writer (in my opinion) and fairly quick at responding.

Being the most fortified and advanced kingdom's of the seven have held off but just enough to get by for the time being. For anyone caught between the two remaining.. well that's where thing's get interesting. The higher power no longer stands, either the rebellion or few survivors stand. Those who choose to fight instead of flee either were captured or slaughtered, the dark elves and grand-master mages have gone rouge and seek to destroy anything and anyone. Those who have been fighting since the start have lost many but there is still hope for those who seek to rebuild or end this evil. \n\nYour role can either be one of the mages fighting, a novice mage, one of the many rouge's, or a grand-master. I'm open to ideas and suggestion's and anything in between. \n\nHi, so this is just a concept and a bit of a work in progress but I'd love to work on it with anyone who seems interested in this. I'm really excited to get back into the swing of thing's and hopefully can find a few people to run this with.",

            "selftext": " *Hello*.\n\nI'm currently looking for Advanced Literate Writers that are familiar to a decent extent with any of the Manga/Anime series of **My Hero Academia**, **Bleach**, **JoJo's Bizarre Adventure** or **Bakugan**. Those interested should be comfortable and technical with their use of the English Language, as grammatical/punctuation inconsistency and consistent spelling mistakes are not fun to have to bear witness to. The expectation is for intricate use of the Third Person, primarily in the past tense, and descriptive language - no matter the context - with a two to three paragraph *minimum* per reply.\n\nRegarding schedule, I don't expect you to always be available by any means - but to at least keep open communication to ensure that there is no disconnect. I myself possess a busy schedule, and will often not be able to write for long swathes of time depending on personal circumstance, and so you will have to bear that in mind. Rest assured, however, as should I be forced to take an absence for a significant amount of time, I will make sure to let you know post-haste.\n\nWith regards to the content itself, I am open to all themes and types of storytelling (**Except** NSFW), and I am willing to be pliable with your preferences (within reason, of course). My aim is to create a long-running narrative with many exciting, engaging plots in between. I am not open for the use of Original Characters as a general rule, though we *may* be able to find a compromise in that regard. I would prefer the Roleplay itself to take place on **Discord**, though - again - I may be willing to compromise in specific circumstances.\n\nFor each series in particular, I tend to muse a certain number of canon characters, and I do my utmost best to portray each of those characters as close to the source material as I can. In the case of certain characters, I do employ several headcanons (As the characters themselves often have limited screen time, thus opening a lot of leeway in that regard), however I do not headcanon anything *too* far out of what is reasonable. Other than my muses, I am open to portraying many other characters from each series upon request, however I am - naturally - less confident and fluent with those that I don't directly muse, and so I will have to acclimate before I can write up to an acceptable standard.\n\nAnd so, without further ado, my muses are as follows: (*Italics* indicate Primary/Main muse)\n\n**Bleach**:\n\n* *R\u014dj\u016br\u014d \u2018Rose\u2019 \u014ctoribashi*\n* Izuru Kira\n* Asuka Katakura\n* Yasutora \u2018Chad\u2019 Sado\n* Jackie Tristan\n* Shukuro Tsukishima\n* Jugram Haschwalth\n* Askin Nakk le Varr\n* *Cang Du*\n* Berenice Gabrielli\n\n**JoJo's Bizarre Adventure:**\n\n* *Yoshikage Kira (JoJolion)*\n* Rai Mamezuku (JoJolion)\n* Magenta Magenta (Steel Ball Run)\n* Hot Pants (Steel Ball Run)\n* Blackmore (Steel Ball Run)\n* *Narciso Anasui (Stone Ocean)*\n* *Leone Abbacchio (Vento Aureo)*\n* Pannacotta Fugo (Vento Aureo)\n* Yuya Fungami (Diamond is Unbreakable)\n* Terunosuke Miyamoto (Diamond is Unbreakable)\n* Noriaki Kakyoin (Stardust Crusaders)\n\n**My Hero Academia**:\n\n* *Hanta Sero*\n* Yuga Aoyama\n* Mezo Shoji\n* Mashirao Ojiro\n* Fumikage Tokoyami\n* Itsuka Kendo\n* Yosetsu Awase\n* Neito Monoma\n* Sen Kaibara\n* Tetsutetsu Tetsutetsu\n* *Tsunagu Hakamada A.K.A* ***Best Jeanist***\n* Ken Tatagi A.K.A **Rock Lock**\n* Hari Kurono\n\n**Bakugan**:\n\n* Shun Kazami\n* Alice Gehabich\n* *Volt Luster*\n* Spectra Phantom\n* Hydron\n* *Jesse Glenn*\n* Mason Brown\n* Gill \n\n(This list may be updated over time.)\n\nIf you are interested in this request, please send me a DM as soon as is convenient for you. Please state the phrase *'Kore ga soudesu'* at the end of your DM, just so I know that you have read this far. Thank you ever so much, and I await your response.\n\nBest wishes, **Luxierre**.",

            "selftext": " Hello there! Ill keep this short and sweet.\n\nAs  the title says I am seeking a partner for the avatar fandom, preferably someone playing a male character. I have a character who is a scientist that drives an avatar so Id like my partner to be one of the natives who helps her along. Deep dives into the lore are not required, all I ask is that you have seen the movie. Romance is an option for those who love that, as well as a friendship between characters. Discord is a must and please be over 18, not for any adult reasons other than I am 24  years old and would prefer a fellow adult. I am also open to other ideas but this is where my main muse is residing.\n\nMy time zone is GMT but I usually have nothing to do all day so responses can be written multiple times a day.\n\nAlso, third person is favorable along with no one-liners, I understand posts cannot always be super long but 3-5 lines is the minimum.\n\nIf you made it this far, congratulations! Now answer this question with WRONG answers only.\n\nWhy is the sky blue?\n\nHope to hear from y'all soon, my muse has been running super high and I am itching for a good story!",

            "selftext": "Let\u2019s get to business!\n\nI\u2019m looking for new roleplays. Specifically fandom roleplays but if the idea is interesting enough I will do an oc x oc roleplay but I am picky. \n\nI\u2019ll start with my fandom ideas. I\u2019m mainly looking for a seven deadly sins roleplay or potentially something transformers or just symbiote based. I would appreciate it if you can play canon as I am a canon x oc roleplayer. I don\u2019t mind playing canon on the side or multiple characters but I do not play canon full time. \n\nAny other fandoms I have consist of: hellboy, blue exorcist, \n\nOc based roleplays are a bit more tricky. I\u2019m a stickler for fantasy- specifically dragons. Come at me with a dragon plot you\u2019ll have a higher chance of getting me interested, even if it\u2019s \u2018weird\u2019. I\u2019m not huge on action or post apocalyptic and I prefer to come up with plots with my partner. I would also love to do some sort of family based roleplay! Wether it\u2019s a merging of house holds, maybe starting a new family, even a chaotic sibling roleplay! All of these will not be romance.\n\nNow if you\u2019ve gotten this far you\u2019re either interested or bored which I commend you to. Now let\u2019s get into the rules and such\n\nI am advanced literate! Please be somewhere similar. All I ask is 5 plus lines and to type cohesive sentences. It\u2019s all good being able to type 5+ paragraphs but if they\u2019re a garble of poor English and grammar then it\u2019s not exactly worth it. Same the other way around. It\u2019s one thing to type a handful of lines but what\u2019s the use of putting a lot of detail in to 2 or 3 lines. It seems counterproductive \n\nLimits wise. I can cope with most things. Furry? Cool- send me pictures of your fursona ooc unless were using them in the rp. Into some messed up things? Dear god give me a warning first. \n\nFinally- I have troubles in my personal life medically. Sometimes I am unable to reply to posts for a day or 2 at a time. If that\u2019s an issue let me know so I can warn you in advance if I feel as if I\u2019m going to hit one of those points. I\u2019ll appreciate any and all ooc talk as long as it doesn\u2019t overshadow the roleplay. \n\nThank you if you\u2019ve gotten this far! I hope to hear from you all soon.",

I\u2019m open to hear you out on the role play and if you want to add or change some stuff, we can talk about it. I\u2019m still new to role playing by the way. I use Kik for my platform but I\u2019m willing to make a discord too and I can\u2019t wait to do it with you.\n\n\nI\u2019m at the dock of the island with a recruitment stand for my crew in front of a giant galleon ship with three masts. With the sails raised and the flag lowered. A octopus sculpture at the front of the hull. The sigh at the top of my recruitment stand having a tilt to the side barely hanging on, with the sign saying pirate recruitment on it.

This rp will be the end of crime in Gotham\u2019s streets. This will be a long term rp. I hope you all enjoy the prompt!\n\nStarter:\nGordon coughs being in a hospital bed. Silence filled in the room, only hearing the beeping of the heart machine. Gordon was dying from all his adventures. He looks at the cops standing in his room to pay respects. He look at you. You were his head chef in command. He points to you and curls his finger telling you come closer. You begin to get closer to him and he said in almost a whisper. \u201cKeep this city safe.\u201d He looked up into your eyes. He then turns his head to look out of the window. You and other men look out of the window into the night sky. You saw two white eyes  staring into the building. Gordon knew it was me. He closed his eyes when the machine made an endless beep. The cops take their hats off in respect. You kept your eyes on me. But in seconds bats surround me and i vanished once the bats depart. You let out a sigh and went home. \n\nThe next morning, i was just going to bed while Alfred made breakfast for himself. Knowing he\u2019ll have to make breakfast for me at noon. You were awake and ready to be at work. You grabbed your keys and a fruit shake you make every day. You got in your car driving to work. Gordon\u2019s last words to you echoed in your head. \u201cKeep this city safe\u201d you sigh and walked inside the police station. You see your new second in command in your new office. He was plugging your computer in making sure it works. You walked in and...(continue from there)\n\nConclusion:\nThank you for reading. Just so i know you read it just send the word \u201cGotham\u2019s Savior\u201d and your discord name. Thanks!\n\n\n\n\ufffc",

I tend to have a shy personality which I usually implement into my roleplays but it's never a mandatory thing that I need to include and some other things about my personality is that I'm normally pretty nice, caring, supportive, understanding and a little bit funny.\n\nNow onto the basic idea of this post: I am looking for a 16+ F that enjoys and is also looking to play out a romantic slice of life style rp with me in any genre that you would prefer as long as I'm alright with it such as normal, adventure, survival, etc... I would of course prefer this be longterm as well which I hope is alright with you as well. We can also come up with more together once we figure out what both of us likes so that we can make the roleplay as enjoyable as it can be for the both of us.\n\nHope to hear from at least one person but even if nobody is interested I still hope you all have a wonderful rest of your day:) \n\nOh one more thing, I also have kik and discord if you prefer to roleplay on one of those, just let me know in the message.",

            "selftext": "Prompt:\n\nSpenser Remington likes to pretend his life is pretty average. Problem is, he can\u2019t seem to go a week without something weird happening around him. Vampires, werewolves, ghosts... okay, sure, those aren\u2019t exactly normal, but who\u2019s to say what normal is, right? Maybe he\u2019s just a magnet for disasters.\n\nSuffice to say, he\u2019d really, really prefer these things not happen around him, especially not when he\u2019s trying to finish this gap year and maybe somehow get into Quantico (a guy can dream, right?) but someone\u2019s gotta deal with these impromptu disasters. And unless someone else is volunteering as tribute, of which approximately zero people have done, he\u2019s stuck dealing with the supernatural.\n\nYour character happens to be one of those supernatural beings. It appears Spenser\u2019s luck has once again bestowed upon him an unexpected problem to solve. Well, let\u2019s hope this doesn\u2019t get messy...\n\n\nInformation:\n\nI\u2019m thinking our characters are 18-25-ish. No minors, please. Spenser is a 19-year-old fairly basic human dealing with all manner of unusual beings and is rapidly becoming fairly adept at, well, not dying. Thankfully for him.\n\nAt its core this is human x supernatural being and M/M, so if that interests you, I might be your fellow. If you think you might have a character that would be interesting playing across from a snarky human that\u2019s trying hard to find some direction in life, let\u2019s see what happens.\n\nNote, I\u2019m fine with romance but I can\u2019t force it. I can never guarantee how Spenser might respond to your OC. They could be friends, they could be enemies, they could be more, who knows? Natural chemistry is important to me and I like to let the winds take me where they will, so to speak.\n\n\nTechnical Bits:\n\nI like Discord. I generally like posting once per day. I also like about a paragraph per response (with more if the scene naturally gets longer and needs it), and other writers who are at least 21+.\n\nI\u2019d prefer discussing the possible rp here on Reddit for a little before swapping to Discord. If you\u2019re interested, tell me about your character\u2014who is he? What kind of creature is he? What problem does he have that Spenser can help him solve (useful for plot)? Is there anything specific you are looking for out of the story? All useful things!",

The township of Winston-Salem is the starting point for exploring Witch craft and the mountains of North Carolina. Though the town is amazing for its own. Winston-Salem is surrounded by mountains, and is the definition of quaint, with manicured gardens, buildings with rock fa\u00e7ades, and hanging flowerpots dotted around the main street, every month is a warmer month, hurricane season even everyone agrees the rain is beautiful.

And then a little four hour drive you can make it to the ocean line. \n\nThough in the spring of 2019, at the beginning of June, there was a reoccurring situation happening on the campuses of the high school and college that phasing was happening to the point that several of the students had passed away. That wasn\u2019t the only reoccurring thing that happened not here on campus of the high school and college people were receiving video tapes and tape recorder tapes of inside their dorm room or their sorority house. It had got to the point that no one felt safe so when the kids went home for the summer the dean had cleared out most of the dorm rooms and sorority houses. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the fall of 2019 when everyone was back on campus that they realized that the ongoing\u2018s were still happening but now that the ongoing\u2018s were happening in everyone\u2019s house around town. That people were receiving video tapes and tape recorders of their house around town. \n\nWas this a collection of someone\u2019s? Was this person dangerous? Was what everyone was thinking.

            "selftext": " \n\nHello there! My name is Olivia, and I'm looking for some new semi-literate to literate partners to write out a new story that I've had the time to workshop recently. It focuses mainly on a wizard and a hired bodyguard travelling in order to decipher an ancient text that has recently come in to her possession. I am open to any changes, and while I have a loose plot set in place, nothing is quite set in stone.\n\nI enjoy my stories to have a good amount of substance and grit to them, so I do ask that my partners be willing to write more than just fluff or slice of life-- I ask for characters to have substance, and depth. Thank you for taking the time to read, and please enjoy the brief starter below, as both an introduction to my writing style and the story itself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\~\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe woman who stepped into the guild hall did not look like she belonged in such a place. She wore fine clothing, a dress without the usual frills and whistles that many ladies of the state wore these days, but still made from fine silk, a deep maroon in colour, embroidered with golden thread. She was slender, a satchel hanging from her side full to near-spilling of various scrolls-- attached to the strap, was a thick, smallish leather-bound book, held shut with twine wrapped around a waxen button on the front cover. It was nondescript, but the metallic scent to it betrayed it as having magical qualities. Her skin was pale, arms largely covered by the similarly-coloured cloak she wore to stave off the falltime winds that cut through the town, though her face was uncovered. Unscarred, she bore round features, a slightly-upturned nose. Her eyes were a bright green colour, near-yellow in the centre, her hair a somewhat rare, but still tamed copper.\n\nAs she reached the counter, the guildsmaster offered her a nod in greeting-- it seemed she was expected, at least to some capacity, and in response to the nod, the stranger gave the elven woman-- a shorter, plumper sort of elf, with the typical features associated-- long ears, angular features, pale, long hair-- a smile.\n\nQuiet words exchanged, the redhead reached into her bag, removing an envelope, sealed with a red, rounded waxseal, and, placing it on the table, gestured to the board of work to be claimed. The guildsmaster nodded, and the stranger gave her a half-smile. Turning to the board, removing another piece of paper from her satchel, and pinning it to a small amount of empty space, the job was posted. The payment was assured, and the stranger made her way out of the guild hall, eager to be free of the scent of fifty men and women who did not get paid enough to bathe regularly.\n\n*\u201cHELP WANTED,\u201d* The sign read, in flowing, careful script. *\u201cI am searching for an adventurer with which to travel Northwards, who will serve as my protection, and who will be able to use discretion with the materials with which I will be working. There will be peril, and the journey will be long, but you shall be fed well and paid handsomely. Pack warm clothing and prepare to camp often. More details to those interested.\u201d*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\~\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for taking the time to read my post, and if this interests you, please shoot me a DM on Reddit. Have a lovely day!",

            "selftext": "Hi I am looking for three rps.First a few requirements:-semi-literate to literate rp-romance/fluff-frequent responses-18+ due to NSFW -discuss and plan plot with me-please be friendly-mxf (I play female)\n\n1. CorpseHusband (or *very* similar oc) X my oc (slice of life)\nIn this you are playing Corpse or a similar oc, and I am playing my oc. She is a new streamer who isn\u2019t faceless exactly but wears a mask and a wig. She goes by the name CodeNeko. This will be a romance between the two with plenty of fluffy and cute scenes. They first become friends from running in the same circles but then grow closer. Though there is some drama (another youruber, I picked tommyinnit but it can be anyone we both know or a made up one) openly flirts with and says he likes my oc. I have a few ideas on cute and dramatic scenes we could do, as well as other scenes like how they meet in person and such. This will have time skips because they\u2019re not always together.\n\n2. CorpseHusband (or *very* similar oc) X my oc\nIn this you are playing Corpse or a similar oc, and I am playing my oc. She is a artist and game designer. She designs the art for games and even codes them at times. She moves in next door and catches your characters attention. Though she is not exactly what she seems. She has a magical video game (sort of like Jumanji) where when played the players get transported into the game. They can take damage and even die and it feels real though doesn\u2019t effect them in the real world. When your character starts to become with my oc things get complicated as it seems she\u2019s hiding something and keeps disappearing. That is until she takes him into the game with her. The game (or at least what I thought it should be we can change it) is a gangster like game, almost like the Joker, similar to Gotham city. The game itself has the power to bring out the players darkest desires and push them. It can either be this game or a fantasy game.\n\n3. Villainish oc x my oc\nThe premise of the rp is that my character is transported into this world, it is her favorite book. She is transported as a side character but she ends up becoming the main character, taking the role the protagonist should have. In this world, either the gangster world from above or a fantasy world you are the villain. This can be a dark villain if you like. They can be in charge of the mob, a solo criminal, the king of the court of the rouge, a tyrant of a king or a sadistic duke. It is really up to you. I say villain because they are a darker character but in the eyes of the book they are the protagonists love interest, so they are the villain or bad in that world but in terms of story there is another villain since the novel is a romance.\nPlease dm me and say which rp or rps you would like to do. And what you are thinking of character wise. For the first two I would really prefer it if you DIDN\u2019T play an oc. IF you do I will need them to be close to the real thing, I will just be less likely to actually like and rp if they are not.",

I have a few pre-made characters that I can use in a high fantasy setting, but if you\u2019d like, I can create an entirely new one! For a bit of info about me, I\u2019m 18, I\u2019m in EST, and I have a few years of roleplay experience. I write in third person past tense, and I usually write a paragraph or two, but I can certainly do only a few sentences if you\u2019d like. The one thing I\u2019d really like in my roleplays is romance! I personally feel that it just makes the story more interesting.\n\nMy plot ideas are:\n\nA member of royalty and their new royal guard who initially don\u2019t like each other, but eventually warm to one another. \n\nA human who stumbles into a kingdom of another race and is put in jail, but is saved by one of the members of the other race\n\nA peasant who runs away from their village as it\u2019s destroyed and vows revenge, then meets you\n\nThese are just a few quick ideas I have, but I\u2019m also interested in any ideas you have!! If you\u2019d like to roleplay with me but don\u2019t like those ideas, we can absolutely use some of yours. And that\u2019s about it! If anything I\u2019ve said interests you, feel free to message me! And even if not, have a wonderful day!",

I don\u2019t have a plot set in stone, but I\u2019m certainly up for discussion and ideas. Message me if you\u2019re interested!",

I haven\u2019t in a while and seeing the movies on TV and gifts that are HP themed as me dying for one. \n\nI can play most characters, however i usually only like to do Marauders or golden trio era if it\u2019s going to be canon. But i am also happy to RP with OCs!\n\nNo strict requirements for length or experience. Just keep the story going! \n\nDiscord is preferred. Send me a message and let\u2019s go from there (:",

            "selftext": "Hello there! I'm itching for some MHA again! I am seeking quality partners that are interested in a long term MHA roleplay that follows the story of Izuku and friends after graduating from U.A. high.\n\nPlease read below as I'll list some key details about what I'm looking for in a partner, read **carefully** as it is obvious when one doesn't:\n\n\u2022 18+ in age, please! Dark themes can and will occur in the roleplay.\n\n\u2022 If you want to play a canon character you must be caught up to the Manga. If you are not caught up, original characters are more than welcomed to this roleplay! I love original characters and have a few of my own for this RP.\n\n\u2022 Daily/frequent response rate. This is going to be a LONG term roleplay and I'd like my partner and I to be able to progress the story in a meaningful way. Obviously life happens and there are some days responses are impossible. Happens to the best of us.\n\n\u2022 3rd person.\n\n\u2022 The canon material is very important to me. It's why I'm so passionate about MHA, of course. Because of this, I'd like our roleplay to work off of the canon to create new material for our roleplay! What this means is that there won't be things such as Deku x Bakugo romance included in the story.\n\n\u2022 Due to the above bullet point, spoilers from the manga are bound to happen! I'll try my best not to spoil things left and right and keep spoilers to a minimum.\n\n\u2022 Two paragraph reply, minimum. There'll be some times where there can be an exception to this rule but the standard should be two paragraphs. Want to write more than that? Awesome. I love multiple paragraphs!\n\n\u2022 Passionate. I can't stress this one enough. Even if you don't watch or read My Hero Academia, as long as you're hyped about it and ready to kick some RP butt, we're going to have a great time together.\n\n\u2022 Friendly OOC chatter is always welcomed!\n\n\u2022 You are not your character! Don't forget that when we're roleplaying together. I am also not my character. Do not take our character interactions personally or I will shut down the roleplay altogether and move on.\n\n\u2022 If you want to have a say in the direction of the story, then do your part. I am more than fine with being a DM but if you do not make an effort to create major or even minor story plots, I will assume you want me to take the reigns and control the majority of the world. Please make your intentions for the roleplay obvious. In the same vein, if you intend on being a major operator of the world's story as I do, please make sure what you're writing makes sense in the scope of what's happening during the RP at that time. While I am looking for a semi-casual/casual experience during slice of life moments and all of that good business, I also care about quality writing when it comes to major arcs/plot points and how they flow into the existing story.\n\n\u2022 This final point is more so me just rambling on about my thoughts with the roleplay. I am very much looking for someone that is dedicated to great story telling for this roleplay. I am extremely passionate about MHA and the universe it takes place in and I absolutely love creating stories within the setting. I just hope that whoever contacts me is pumped to do this roleplay and is in it for a long, fulfilling experience.\n\nI believe that's everything! Shoot me a message and I'll get back to you as soon as possible. Thanks for reading!",
