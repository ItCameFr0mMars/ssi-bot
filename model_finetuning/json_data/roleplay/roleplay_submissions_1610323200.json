            "selftext": "Hi everyone! Hope you're having a great day :)\n\nSo today I'm looking for a MHA roleplay that focuses on, you guessed it, All Might! I've been really curious about his backstory and, seeing as we have barely enough information about him, I thought why not create our own story? Taking what limited info we have on him, I'm sure we can weave a wonderful story together!\n\nTo be more specific, I'm looking to play as a young Yagi Toshinori and explore what trials he had to go through to become the Symbol of Peace we all know and love today. As for your character, I don't mind anyone at all. From a lover OC from his childhood, to a canon character that had a huge impact on his life or even to a DM that walks me through a great story of an upcoming hero, you can be whoever you like!\n\nSome important things to note are that I write only on Discord, in 3rd person, and write long paragraphs (~500 words.) I am a *huge* lover of angst and dark themes so these are to be expected to come up, since I like to focus on the many tragedies he had to face. Lastly, for NSFW, I'd rather we avoid it.\n\nThat's about it! In your message, include whether you're caught up with the manga, so I know you've read the whole thing. Cheers! :D",

Just lost my job, so I have a good bit of free time while I hunt for a new one! I don't have any particular ideas, right now. If you do, I\u2019d love to hear them! I love a good fantasy setting, historical setting, sci-fi, but I'm open to collaborating. Having a craving for something dark, maybe with vampires, or werewolves, demons, dragons, merfolk. or magic. You get the gist, I like mythical beings. If that\u2019s not your cup of tea, please still message me! \n\nI\u2019m just usually NOT into Slice of Life, modern settings, or Fandoms.\n\nA little about me. I'm 27 (so please be around my age. I can't be doing this with an 18 year old, sorry, be at least close to my age?) I've been role-playing on and off since I was about 14, so this isn't anything new. I currently have one role play partner on discord, which I've been writing with since the beginning. The stories are always fun, but they're not testing my writing abilities anymore. I'm on EST. Reply length doesn't really matter to me, the longer the better, of course, but it's quality over quantity. I don't really have any limits when it comes to quantity. I typically play female character, but I'm open to playing both, and am willing to play multiple characters as needed.\n\nAs I said, I don't have any specific ideas in mind, I'd love to hear anything! I can also work with you to come up with an idea, if you have none and I like our vibe. Oh! Also, I don't want this to be just business. I'd like to also make a new friend, and occasionally have conversations outside the story. If that's cool with you?\n\nWell, I think that's everything! If you're still here, and are still interested, please shoot me a message, maybe start off with a joke! Give me a bit about you? I look forward to meeting you!",

            "selftext": " A poorly made dirt and pebble riddled path cuts through Ristell before spreading into three or four different paths, segmenting the small village in a not-so neat half. On one side, a looming wooden construct of exceptional make sticks out against the other ramshackle homes. Wooden logs, shaved into sharp points, are hammered deep into the ground around this compound. Home to the Reiters, this three storied building houses a group of well disciplined mercenaries that can be found patrolling the streets with their uniform black and purple sigils sewn onto their left shoulders. Many of these men appear battle hardened; grizzled with grisly scars that indicate their skill and experience in battle. Directly opposite of this Fort lies the rather empty village square, a stone fountain with absolutely no water spewing from its grimy insides acting as the only decorative piece in this otherwise desolate area. Deeper in the rather small cluster of huts, atop a small grassy mound, rests a proper bastion of hewn copper-like bricks with a few guards wearing muck covered half plate armor patrolling the ramparts of this strange Keep.\n\nOur story, however, begins inside one of the only taverns in Ristell. On the outside, the building is hewn from rough grey stone and framed with a rich, oaken wood that seems far too expensive in a village like this. A freshly painted sign that reads \u2018Bart\u2019s Boisterous Brewery\u2019 dangles from the front -- the gold colored paint catching the eye of any passersby. Here, in this small inn, a few wandering paths and destinies begin to intertwine.\n\nGreetings, intrepid travelers! My name is 1b, aspiring dungeon master and longtime RPer! I've been developing this small world of mine for a few months now but with no group to DM, it's been left to collect dust. No longer, I say! To finally get some use out of this world, I've decided to try and find a partner to explore and develop more of the world at the same time. A win, win; if you ask me.\n\nSome ground rules:\n\nAs always, fun! Fun should be the number one priority between both parties. If you aren't having fun, I'd prefer you tell me why instead of ghosting. It'll help me both improve my RP and setting. Once again, a win-win.\n\n18+ is a must. I find that RP tends to stray towards NSFW themes and I'm a huge fan of em' aswell.\n\nDiscord is another big must. I love discord in comparison to a lot of other mediums and it's the one I'm most comfortable with.\n\nLiteracy, literacy, literacy! I don't incredibly mind post length (barring one liners) as I usually adapt to match my partners in length. However! The bigger the posts, the better.\n\nThose are a majority of the big rules. We'll discuss more of character creation and whatnot if we do decide to start RPing. If you are at all interested, send me a message on reddit. I'd love to discuss with you more in private.\n\nStay safe and have a great day!",

            "selftext": "Cyberpunk 2077 has proven to be my favorite game of last year, flaws and all. Currently, I'd be interested in a roleplay set in the game's universe and setting. Admittedly, I don't have a plot in mind but I'm always up for some collaboration and coming up with something that'd suit the both of us!\n\nAs per usual, before getting into what I had in mind, my reqs for a writing partner: Partner must be 20+ in terms of age due to the likelihood of swearing, violence and complex themes. Please be able to write detailed paragraphs, I prefer quality over quantity. I'm also open to romantic themes but only if it's discussed beforehand as a possibility otherwise I likely won't pursue it.\n\nThat should cover it! As I mentioned at the beginning of the post, I don't have a solid plot in mind but open to brainstorming. I'd prefer to stick to Night City and around the year of 2077. If we're at a complete loss for a story, I wouldn't mind going over the events of the game with OCs. There's also an idea I had with our characters being part of Trauma Team, but I'd rather explore other options before trying for that.   \nAnyway, if you're interested don't hesitate to drop me a PM!",

            "selftext": "Mason Krait is an upcoming chemist studying at Gotham university.  Though he is 19, he excels in his chosen fields as a young prodigy.  But Gotham is Gotham, and Mason is not exempt from the city's rules.  Often Mason gets mugged, or his research and chemicals stolen, and students often bribe his professors into raising their grades, which makes Mason furious.  One night, he hears a scuffle happening on his way home, and investigates.  As it happens, the fight has moved on, but in it's wake, left a few small canisters of some sort of chemical inhalent, blood, and a batarang.  Curious, Mason snatched a few of the canisters and took them back to his apartment, where after he opens one, begins to experience horrific hallucinations of his darkest fears.  Realizing that he had stumbled across the Scarecrow's signature Fear toxin, Mason decides to reverse engineer it and use it as a tool to dispense justice.  Donning a crude replica of the Scarecrow's outfit, modified with black fabric instead of the brown burlap, and a crudely made sickle, he wandered the streets, hunting criminals as: The Spectre.  But elsewhere, a similar person has a similar incident inspire them to become a hero, or a Villain.  Whether it's a freak accident, lucky chance or born with super abilities, the two convene and begin to fall in love.\n\nHello R/Roleplay, I'm looking for a partner to do a super hero rp set in the DC universe, specifically Gotham. Im 18+ and all participants must be 18+ with no exception.  Due to the nature of fear toxin, I sometimes wish to reveal the victims fear in detail, so graphic warnings may come up.   I also imagine Mason/The Spectre will become more of an anti hero, due to his methods and weapon, the Sickle of the Spectre.  Your character can be anything you want, super or not.  I ask that maybe they are another student of this Gotham University, but they don't have to be.  We can discuss further in pms, and I can do this in either reddit pms or discord, with discord preferred.  Thanks!",

I have almost no restrictions on plot, as long as the plot doesn't yell \"monstrosity\" You got your dream plot you've been meaning to use? Yeah! You want to have a slice of life? Sci-fi? Post-apocalyptic? Super-natural? A literal highschool? Fandoms? Multiversal? Romance? I'm open of all of this as long as it doesn't follow disturbing content. (But in general I lLLLLOOOOVVEEEE Romance.)\n\nAll I want is to have ny partner +18, write in third person, and a decent amount.(not like WAYYY to much, I can write 3 paragraphs, or less.) These things would be really good to have in a partner.\n\nOh, also. It'd be lovely if you introduced yourself in the DMs. I can use this platform, and discord(if anybody is interested in it anyway.)\n\nLastly, I'd love you to give it a try. I might have done something very wrong to not communicate or respond(I do not recall), but I really want you to contact my DMs. You don't have to ask here, just raid my DMs! I'll be answering as soon as I can.\n\nPlease, I really need some friends who I can spend time roleplaying with!\n\nThank you so much\n\n~Cuquin",

            "selftext": " \n\nHello readers! Praybird here, a 22 year old Korean living in NA, looking for new RP partners. I have a fair amount of time in my hands that I wish to dedicate to RP again, and I can normally make several posts per day, give and take. I don\u2019t mind pairing or character types, and always willing to play multiple characters for the plot\u2019s sake. I\u2019m majorly looking for modern or high fantasy plots; I do have an original fantasy world I default to, but I\u2019m always open to more worldbuilding with partners that enjoy it.\n\nHoping to find an active partner who loves to chat about the RP, be it world or character building, or simply gushing with songs and pictures and small talk. Shoot me a DM if this interests you - I majorly write on Discord.",

            "selftext": " Hey there, my name is Tez and I very much love Danganronpa, and after a fresh re-play of the series over December, I am very much re-invigorated with spirit and muse for the series.\n\nNow then! I've got *five OCs* I'm really looking to put to work! I'm open to both canon characters as well as other OCs! The OCs are quite varied, and I think I've got myself quite a good spread of personalities, looks, motivations, talents and all that kinda stuff. All of which have well written out bios, as well as reference art for appearance, I take my character creation seriously, as I hope you'll find!\n\nI'm open to playing just one pairing, or multiple ones- if we work out things well enough! On that topic, should we do OC/Canon stuff, I am always open to doubling/playing a canon for your OC as well- so please let me know if that's something that interests you!When it comes to playing canons, I will do my utmost to portray them as accurately as I can for you, granted you do the same for me! Please don't let this be a point of stress or pressure though, you never learn without trying, after all!\n\nAs far as content goes, I'm open to pretty much anything! Whether it's more short and sweet, or something more drawn out and plotty. I've definitely got a soft spot for shipping and romance and would love to include elements of that- and it's worth nothing that this doesn't mean it has to be all that, of course!I'm predominantly interested in playing against *feminine* characters. I'm open to some male characters, but it really depends on the character pitched! Otherwise, NB, trans, etc are of course totally welcome!\n\nFor setting, I always love a classic Hope's Peak AU, but I am open to various other settings- including our own killing game setting, so this is far from an issue!\n\nNow that we're close to the end here, it's worth mentioning that I'm interested in someone who can do around 2-5ish paragraphs per post. Though this is no hard limit, and the length of a reply doesn't matter as long as the content is good! Similarly, the more equally excited we can get about our RP, the better! And while it's not *strictly* so, I prefer 18+ players due to the themes, subjects, etc of which the Danganronpa-verse tend to involve and keep close!\n\nIdeally as well, we'll write on Discord! Though, I am open to email or PMs here too! Though please keep in mind that I'd prefer to be **PM'd to start**. Thank you!\n\nAnyway, I think that's about it- I'll be happy to show my tl;drs for my characters upon request, and from there you can see their extended bios depending on who catches your interest! Oh and, please let me know who your favourite character is and why! Call it a little password, or something like that! Just so I know you've fully understood and read everything here!\n\nOkidokes, that's about it from me, hope to see, and write out some fun RPs together!",

            "selftext": " Hey there!\n\nYou can call me Sum, I'm a 24 year old, Canadian (EST) male, looking for a partner for tactical combat/spy espionagish RP. I'm a chill, generally normal dude who enjoys getting to know my RP partners and becoming good friends! I like to write in the third person (many paragraphs, but focus on quality over quantity) and really inject a lot of character and personality into my RP, as well as a strong focus on world building and 'lore', if you will. I just like the RP's to feel like movies, or stories essentially. Love immersion. Also love coming up with stories with people and just making something the two of us absolutely adore.\n\nAbout the rp itself,\n\nI'd love to do something set anywhere from the cold-war, to modern day, or even neat future (2030s, 2040s). The general feel of the RP would be gritty, dirty, with geopolitical themes and questioning the morality of warfare ('we get dirty, and the world stay's clean'). Comparing to modern media, something in the vein of Modern Warfare 2019, Ghost in the Shell, Black Ops, Tom Clancy, Metal Gear, just something along those lines to compare. Given the subject matter; war-crimes, this RP will be marked NSFW. Depending on the partner, we can even maybe work a romance thing into it, should you want that. They say romance is spicier at the end of a loaded gun anyways.\n\nWe can be pilots (planes, future combat vehicles), field grunts, special operations, PMCs, spies, or whatever combat role you can think of.\n\nSo yeah, there's my proposal.\n\nPlease feel free to send me a message and let's talk it about (before going to discord, I only rp on discord) Also, I'm a hetero guy, so if you're looking for some man on man action, not the place unfortunately but we can still be battle-bros. 18+ homies only, thanks, and also this is not a slice of life. Slice of life moments can be sprinkled in but I'd rather spend more time RPing loading a mag into a rifle, over cooking dinner. :P\n\nThanks!! Hope I've peaked someone's interest, and curiosity. Please, feel free! Who ever reads it. :) xo",

I\u2019m recently 30 so I\u2019m looking for partners who are at least 20 (it\u2019s just a comfort thing on my part). I also only rp in 3rd person, and I prefer mxf or fxf for pairings. I also primarily play female characters but will happily play some male side characters when the situation calls for it. As far as length goes I\u2019m not super picky, I just prefer to post match. I currently have a ton of free time as I\u2019m jobless at the present time!\n\nOkay, so now that that\u2019s out of the way! I rp a lot of romance, but I also love platonic family plots. I don\u2019t have any one idea but quite a few bouncing around in my head but I would love to hear others as well! As far as genres I rp I\u2019m mostly into some fandom ( Harry Potter, Star Wars Disney/Fairy Tales, Sherlock, and Marvel and DC), historical plots, fantasy and sci-fi, and slice of life, I also like some supernatural plots, as well as a few other things too! I\u2019m up for just about anything right now! I will say I have been having a craving for something with Sherlock, Mythological, Harry Potter, or a good family plot!\n\nTo talk and plot more just message me on here and we can trade discord handles. I\u2019m currently central time but I\u2019m typically up pretty late!",

If you do, I\u2019d love to hear them! I love a good fantasy setting, historical setting, sci-fi, but I'm open to collaborating. Having a craving for something dark, maybe with vampires, or werewolves, demons, dragons, merfolk. or magic. You get the gist, I like mythical beings. If that\u2019s not your cup of tea, please still message me! \n\nI\u2019m just usually NOT into Slice of Life, modern settings, or Fandoms.\n\nA little about me. I'm 27 (so please be around my age. I can't be doing this with an 18 year old, sorry, be at least close to my age?) I've been role-playing on and off since I was about 14, so this isn't anything new. I currently have one role play partner on discord, which I've been writing with since the beginning. The stories are always fun, but they're not testing my writing abilities anymore. I'm on EST. Reply length doesn't really matter to me, the longer the better, of course, but it's quality over quantity. I don't really have any limits when it comes to quantity. I typically play female character, but I'm open to playing both, and am willing to play multiple characters as needed.\n\nAs I said, I don't have any specific ideas in mind, I'd love to hear anything! I can also work with you to come up with an idea, if you have none and I like our vibe. Oh! Also, I don't want this to be just business. I'd like to also make a new friend, and occasionally have conversations outside the story. If that's cool with you?\n\nWell, I think that's everything! If you're still here, and are still interested, please shoot me a message, maybe start off with a joke! Give me a bit about you? I look forward to meeting you!",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone! I'm Naz, a 21 year old female. I'm looking for someone who would like to do a roleplay in Spanish with me. Even though I enjoy rping in english, spanish is my first language. Sometimes I find english limiting since my vocabulary is extense but not as much as I'd like it to be. You might ask \"Naz, why are you writing in Spanish?\" Well the site is in English so...\n\nI mainly do romance. It can be slice of life, drama, mystery, fantasy. Basically anything as long as there is a bit of romance in it! Also I have a few fandoms I'll add if someone is interested:\n\n-Harry Potter\n-Stranger Things\n-Naruto\n-How I Met Your Mother\n\nAs for ideas I don't really have anything in mind but we can totally think of something! Or if you have ideas of your own I'll be glad to read them (:\n\nI'm leaving a few requirements and info down here:\n\n\u00d7 My partner must be +18. Sorry guys but I wouldn't feel comfortable.\n\u00d7 3rd person only.\n\u00d7 At least 2 paragraphs per answer. NO one liners.\n\u00d7 I probably won't be able to answer every single day. I work, go to college and have a life. I'll try to leave a reply every day but I'm off on weekends since it's when I'm busy the most.\n\nThat's pretty much it! If someone is interested please message me!",

With a loud bang, the door flung open and there stood 18-year-old Maya Hugh. She was sent to a foster family after her parents were killed only 14 years ago. Stepping out, holding her suitcase of clothes. The dim light shone through the foggy air and created a spotlight on her. Maya's tan skin glistening in the light, her long black hair perfectly pulled into a braid, and her green Asian eyes sparkling. The men nodded and she stepped forward, being pulled into the crowd of fellow teenagers. She was the only girl who volunteered to go. Her body was perfect and slim, every inch of her was perfect.

            "selftext": " Oh, hello there!\n\nI'm currently looking for a couple of fandom roleplays, and hoping to find likeminded individuals who'd like to write stories with me. C: For the moment, I'm only looking for fellow female-writers who I can play M for (and if you could double, that would be absolutely fantastic). I'm just more comfortable this way, especially when it comes to the fandoms I'm craving.\n\nA little about me -- I've been roleplaying since around 2007. For several years, I wrote exclusively on GaiaOnline; however, that has seemed to died out extensively as I've grown older. Granted, I've still found some wonderful partners on there that I am still in touch with (a friend of mine and I are still writing after almost eleven years!) but as my interests diversity and branch out, I've found it difficult to find likeminded people in the forums. Speaking of age, I'm 28 and would like if my partner was in and around the same age as well. I'm in EST and can guarantee at least a post or two a day, if we're both really feeling it. I'm also ditch-friendly as life is a whole thing, though I do appreciate the small nudge that something isn't working for you and you'd like to move on. So! As you can tell by my long-winded rant, I'd consider myself a multi-paragraph writer. Though, that's not to say that quality over quantity isn't key; it really just depends on what we come up with, and how excited we are. Each experience differs.\n\nAll that being said, here are the fandoms I'm currently looking for! They're niche and I'm trash, but oh well. Canon x OC is preferred, let me love your beautiful OC.  \nThe list is in order from craving most to least. I've got plots for everything, buuut... I'd also love to work on something together. AU's are also 100% acceptable for these. I've played pretty much every boyo in these spheres, heh.\n\nCharacters in bold are who I'm looking to play!  \n\u2022 Dr. Stone: **Senkuu** *(Please, oh please, ten billion percent number-one-craving!)*  \n\u2022 Jujutsu Kaisen: **Megumi** *(Another pleaseeee ;; ).*  \n\u2022 CollarxMalice: **Takeru** or **Yanagi**  \n\u2022 Persona 5: **Ren** or **Akechi** *(Ohoho or both? :eyes: )*  \n\u2022 Piofiore: **Dante** or **Yang**\n\nSend me a chat or message if you're interested, and thank you for taking the time to read!",

            "selftext": "Hello there. I\u2019m a twenty something guy from the US who\u2019s really gotten back into my love for Star Wars during quarantine. Between finishing the second season of The Mandalorian, rebinging all the movies and animated series, and recently finishing the new canon Thrawn trilogy, I\u2019m just itching for more in a way that only roleplaying can provide. I\u2019m very familiar with the whole of the Star Wars universe, both canon and legends, and would love to play in any era. Here\u2019s some ideas to spark something, but feel free to come to me with any ideas of your own! Prequel Era: For the prequels, I\u2019d love to play either Anakin or Obi-Wan against an OC or Padm\u00e9. Perhaps it\u2019s Obi-Wan and Padm\u00e9 that fell for each other. Maybe Anakin stays in the Light but Palpatine still succeeds in destroying the Jedi and establishing the Empire. Maybe Qui-Gon never died and decided to train Anakin away from the Jedi. The possibilities are endless! Clone Wars Era: While technically in the prequel era, the Clone Wars is just full of so much lore and so many characters of its own. For this era, I\u2019d like to play Anakin, Obi-Wan, or an OC that I have. The OC is a new apprentice assigned to Obi-Wan around the same time that Ahsoka is assigned to Anakin. I\u2019d love to pair him with either Ahsoka or an OC of your own! Anything we do in this era I\u2019d love to see full of action, adventure, and romance, and we can play up to and after Order 66. Post-RotS: For this, we could do Rebels characters, Rogue One characters, or make characters of our own! Perhaps one of us is an officer of the newly established Empire, and the other a Stormtrooper or bounty hunter they\u2019re tasked to work with. Perhaps we\u2019re star crossed lovers, torn between the lines of the Empire and the Rebellion. Maybe one of us is a Rebel star fighter pilot who crash lands on your Imperial-occupied homeworld. Again, endless possibilities! OT-era: For this era, I\u2019d love to play Luke against an OC of yours, or Han against an OC or Princess Leia! Not as many fully fleshed out ideas here. Post-RotJ: For this era, I\u2019d be more than willing to play Din (The Mando) against OCs, Fennic, or Ahsoka. I\u2019d also definitely be willing to play Boba Fett or an OC of my own! We can follow the general plot line of The Mandalorian, or make a plot completely of our own design! Sequel Trilogy Era: I\u2019ll be honest, the execution of the movies soured me on this era, but I could definitely be convinced to do something here. I\u2019d love to take a crack at better representing Ben/Rey, or exploring the dynamics of Poe\u2019s squadron. Hit me up with ideas! If any of these interest you at all, or you have an idea you\u2019ve been dying to try, shoot me a DM! Hope to hear from you!",

I lean more towards roleplaying on discord but it's not a requirement. I do prefer to choose both mine and my partner's characters, but I can make certain exceptions depending on my level of interest in said character whether it's written or a photo. Also, depending on my mood, I may want to roleplay one scenario one day, then the next, be interested in something totally different so just a warning there. I would prefer that if you're not interested in the role or interested in playing with me anymore, I hate ghosts so please have the courtesy of letting me know if you're done with either the roleplay or with me as your partner and I'll try to show the same courtesy in a respectful manner.\n\nHmu and let's roleplay!",

War threatens the kingdom and the princess keeps escaping the castle to explore the city un guarded. She has had many knights leave or get reassigned because she is able to slip from their sight except the new knight seems to be there at her every turn. The two slowly build up romance between them.

I would like an element of romance, but it isn't a deal breaker. I would also like to avoid fandom because everyone sees each fandom differently and I don't want to have issues about someone not playing a character the way someone else sees them.\n\nI am in my late 20s and would prefer my partners be at least 24+, but I can be flexible (I'm NOT flexible with anyone under 20. Sorry.) I would prefer a platform like Discord, but I don't mind where the RP is done. I do my best with grammar/spelling, but everyone makes mistakes. \n\nThat's all I've got for now.

            "selftext": "The first snowfall of the season was quite a strong one, covering the frozen forest with a layer of white fluff. Sparkling flurries fell faster as the winds picked up. For the most part, the forest was empty... except for a man trudging through the nasty winter storm.\n\nLindo, the soldier sent to start the fight against an unknown evil was caught in the thick of the storm in the forest. His metal armor clashed and clanged with creeks here and there as it began to freeze over. His breathing became sharp as he took his two last steps before falling to his knees, the armor on the verge of being frozen solid from the hours of walking through the snowstorm. \n\n\"Is this why they sent me... to get rid of me? I'll just be another soldier lost in his travels.\" He told himself as he felt the frostbite eat away at his tips, the rest of the body to follow. \n\n\"I cant... I mustn't...\" In a last attempt to find a place for refuge during the storm, he reached back with his weak hands and pulled his sword out. He stabbed it into the ground to pull himself up with the support he had. Even with his optimism, it would take a miracle to save him from the storm, as the suit had begun to freeze over completely and the frost was reaching and creeping onto his skin.\n\n_______________\n\nHey everyone, Chris here!\n\nI was thinking I write up a little prompt based of a Fantasy setting and a snowfall. I then made it a little crazy with my character, the elven soldier named Lindo being close to death. \n\nId love for this RP to be a nice mix between a burning romance and an action adventure story against this unknown evil. The frozen forest is just where we will start and we can definately discuss what this evil is, be it a creeping infection/ corruption of the Land or a Dark Lord Emerging.\n\nI dont believe there is anything else i really left out of this post but there probably is. If you need anything else from me, just send me a lovely red or orange envalope and i can definately answer it. I hope to have a very fun and interesting RP with you guys! And as always, all my other prompts are open to RPing too so you can just go through my post history! Thanks for reading and hopefully we can start a fun RP!\n\nPS: Only accepting responses for the prompt through DMs, not chat. \ud83d\ude4f Thanks! \n\n-Chris / u/FelixKold",

            "selftext": "\n\nSil could remember it like it was yesterday, how he ended up in this whole place to begin with. His dark forest green eyes looked out the window by his bed, elven ears giving a small twitch. It didn't feel like it was long ago when he thought his life was over, yet it had only begun really.\u00a0\n\nHaving traveled the world alone it felt like, jumping from one Monastery to another among the people called the Hou-Zi he remembered his training. How he spent years mastering the arts of the Monkey like people, their combat style and their culture, yet all of that never gave him a full sense of fulfilment. He had come to these places in hopes to learn, not just about the ways of a Monk but also how to come out of his shell. Despite standing at 6'3 and having a decent build to him of muscle he still always felt so small in social situations.\u00a0\n\nThe whole traveling began purely out of an emotional decision, that which left him even more meek feeling than he had before. A lover lost to another man, with claims he was far too inadequate. He had given her everything, only just to have it all for not in the end it seemed.\u00a0\n\nWith the decision to return to his homeland he had hoped to find some spot in life, traveling by foot to city to city for work, trying to find his place once more in this land that now felt so different to him. However, nothing prepared him for that fateful night. While walking between cities he was ambushed, by a group of Orcish women looking for their newest catch no doubt, or plaything. Everything was a blur from then, all the things he went through just to be happy again here with an unexpected lover, one of the women that had stolen him away from the very start, having originally swept him off his feet.. literally.\u00a0\n\n-\u00a0\n\nHello all! As you can probably see I'm aiming for a sort of Orc on Elf relationship of sorts, however this is just my personal prompt I had in mind. I am seeking to make a meaningful RP, and this idea came to me just recently with the nature of it being very fond to me. A shy and reserved elf being swept away in a scuffle by a fu orc, just to eventually fall in love with that some woman through a series of events. I am willing to GM it.\u00a0\n\nHowever this doesn't mean I am entirely locked to this idea of course, I am always open to discussing other ideas for the world and so forth, so feel free to shoot me a message at any time!\u00a0\n\nAll that I ask is that you're 18+ of course and detailed in writing, I love to put in effort to make things as lovely sounding as possible and I usually match my partner's energy. So if I get low detail usually give that same thing back, so let's flex our creative minds and have some fun!",

My 2nd choice would be Remus Lupin. \n\nI write semi-lit or lit when it comes to RPs. You don't have to be overtly detailed or make your responses as long as mine, but I also need something to work with. NSFW themes are welcome, be it romance, angst, horror, ect. I also would love someone who would add to the story as well, otherwise it feels very one sided. \n\nAlso please be 18+. I'm 26 myself.\n\nIf this feels like something you'd be interested in hmu!",

I have a few ideas bouncing around in my head but I'd love to hear your own ideas. Please no fandoms or anime sort of things. I prefer the real life stuff.\n\nIf you're interested feel free to send me a message and we can discuss.

            "selftext": "Hello, I am looking for RP partners to share adventures with! I enjoy fantasy, scifi, steampunk, and a few modern rp's. The topics can range from light hearted to dark and speckles of romance.\n\nHowever id prefer/require the partner to be over 18.\n\nI am fairly open to other genre and topics. Including working withing a Fandom universe or making are own. I love world building however, would like to share some of it with the process with the other person.\n\nWith the characters id prefer oc x oc rp and using the cannon as background characters. But can be discussed in pm. \n\nThe oc doesn't need a visual call out but is helpful.\n\nI rp primarily through discord as its easier for me. But open to looking at other places. My only nit pick is try to stick within a 24hr-48hr reply. If its longer please give me a heads up.. Same with being interested or not in continuing.\n\n I dislike pinging people about it..who do not give a heads up. Because i understand life happens.. If need to put on hold for long period let me know. Its ok..its ok to ping me too as i might also look at it then forget to reply. \n\nBut if it does happen i will typically wait a week- a month before i ping then another before ending due to ghost.\n\nAbit about myself:\nI can rp in 3rd and first person, i am semi lit to one liner depending on whats going on in the rp, i do work so can promise atleast 1 reply [i can do more depending on the time of the reply], EST timezone, i am also over 18 [early 20's], is an artist, and love world building.",

Both male and female characters are welcome. There can optionally be romance involved if you would like.\n\nLeo\u2019s full character profile is pinned at the top of my profile. If you would prefer I can also send it over chat/messages.",

            "selftext": "This will be an AU of the game Arcana. \n\nMy idea is fairly simple. Lucio is still the Count of Vesuvia and still hold fights at the coliseum. Although, now it is mostly for sport such as fighting and killing dangerous creatures whom are captured first. On one of his few journeys South, having his guards do everything for him, he encounters Tarske Forest and within it the Protector. \n\nLucio and his guards parade through Vesuvia with the Protector bound to their horses, dragged towards the coliseum. Its clear to all what he plans for this creature. A new battle would commence. \n\nMuriel, who is free from Lucio along with his forget me spell, would often enter the coliseum where the animals were held. Wanting nothing more than to soothe them before their demise or free them if he can. \n\nTonight, he would encounter whatever it was being held in the dungeons below. To his surprise it wasn't at all what he expected. \n\nIt was humanoid, covered in thin vibrant green fur. The legs weren't human but goat like with brown hooves. Their upper body was indeed human like however, the bridge of their nose flat and the nose itself feline like. Their face rounded along with large sapphire eyes. Their ears long and elf like but feathery. The hair a shade darker than its fur and long, it reached their fluffy deer like tail. Their finger tips were pointed and almost claw like. \n\nIt was a staggering sight to say the least. This is the Protector of the Forest. Perhaps he didn't know or perhaps he did. Whatever the case might be, this is where their journey begins. \n\nI have a few rules before we start. \n\u2022 Must be 18+, I am an adult \n\u2022 Play as multiple roles \n\u2022 Add on to the story\n\u2022 Role-play in third person\n\u2022 Must have Telegram\u00a0 \n\nReplies will be slow, so please be patient. You don't have to worry about writing many paragraphs, one paragraph will be good enough. I'm striving to have fun! I need someone to play as Muriel, it doesn't matter what gender you actually are. I will be playing as the Protector. My character has no gender although they are a tad feminine. They are a magical being. \n\nI want this role-play to have lots of fluff and dark moments. \n\nI hope this interests you! Looking forwards to any who messages!",

We can work out more of the actual plot and details there, or on discord.\n\n-I\u2019m on AEDT Timezone, so am usually quite active, most days, and would hope that you are as well, or at least responding on a day to day basis when convenient. \n\n-Hope to hear from some of you, can\u2019t wait to have a good rp",

Please do not contact me if you are under 18 because these rps may include nsfw at times. I am only looking for CanonxCanon. \n\nBe advised some of the ships I like and are about to list are problematic and perhaps triggering to some however we don\u2019t have to rp those ones.The pairings I am most interesting in roleplaying are the following but not limited to\nJotaroxDio\nJotaroxJosuke\nDioxJonathan\nWamuuxJoseph\nSantannaxJoseph\nIm down to rp a lot of stuff though (as long as its Male x Male) and if you have another ship in mind you would like to also rp we can do it if its to my liking. I only rp over discord so if your interested shoot me a DM if you want my tag. I have a few plot ideas for the ones I listed but we can bounce ideas back and forth.",

            "selftext": "***Hello, fellow roleplayers!***\n\nAs the title suggests I'm looking for one, or more, roleplaying partners for a high and dark fantasy setting. Below I've written a short writing sample, a short self introduction, my requirements on a RP partner and what options I can provide as your RP partner. Hopefully this will help you to choose me as your new RP participant!\n\n**Writing sample:**   \nGreat poets and writers spoke of the sea as a vast, blue desert of endless adventure. Hidden treasures, uninhabited islands and colourful fish lured even the most inexperienced sailor to the waters and all ideas of danger and death drowned under the possibilities of fame and riches. In the mind of young folk, the image of the sea glistening like boiling silver and the sense of accomplishment that comes with sailing from one harbour to another, were everything except deterring. Murlaw truly wished he had been there to stop them from ever placing a single toe on a ship. Instead, all he could do for them were to fish out their rigid bodies from the icy water.\n\nBrisk air made frost cling to his lashes and stubble, coating them with a bright sheen. His nose and cheeks were rosy which clashed heavily with the forlorn look in his eyes. Every winter young, inexperienced sailors lost their lives in the unforgiving storms. Out of respect for fellow sailors Murlaw made sure to bring their bodies back to the nearest harbour, his heart weeping for every mother who is yet to know that their sweet child has been taken by the sea.\n\n\"The next time I hear a bard sing about treasure and adventure at sea, I'll choke him with the strings of his lute\" he grumbled as another body hit the deck of his frigate.\n\n\"I have to agree with you there, Captain\" answered his own ship bard.\n\n*\\[OC: Murlaw Viksegel Tristus. His profile is pinned on my account\\]*\n\n**About me:**   \nI'm a 21 year old woman from Europe with a total of 8 years of literate RP experience. I'm fairly new at roleplaying on Reddit and Discord so it still feels slightly strange, however I'm adapting quickly. Writing has been a hobby of mine for many years and I dream of publishing a collection of short horror stories one day. As many others I've played many fantasy games which is what motivated me to start  roleplaying  in the first place. In my free time I play a lot of video games, read, crochet and cook. Yes, aside from the gaming, I'm basically a grandmother.\n\n**Requirements:**\n\n* **18+**\n* **Only literate RP**. I'm not too picky with the amount of paragraphs but I require at least 1 paragraph with a minimum of 10 sentences. There's no maximum limit.\n* **Adding on the plot.** The RP will grow stale fast if both of us don't move the plot forward.\n* **Message me if you're busy.** You have a private life and I respect that! Instead of just disappearing from the RP, message me and we'll put the RP on hold until you have time to reply. I will do the same if I become too busy to write proper replies. \n* **Reddit or Discord.** On Reddit we can either RP through chat or straight onto your, or my, profile. On Discord it's easiest to just add each other and use the regular chat, unless you have another suggestion. I don't use any other social media for RP.\n* **No public NSFW content.** Such things aren't for the public eye my friend.\n* **Don't slay my character please.** It might sound strange but it has happened before. Unless we've agreed on it before the RP, don't kill my character.\n* **Don't alter your character to fit a certain situation.** I'd rather see your character be bad at some things than them being good at everything.\n* **Don't rush.** I don't mind if your reply takes time, I'm quite a slow writer myself. Don't leave me hanging for far too long though. As I stated earlier, message me if you need some time away from the RP.\n* **Have fun!** This is the most important part! If you're not having fun then tell me so, I won't get angry or disappointed if you wish to finish the RP early because you're not enjoying it.\n\n**What I can provide:**\n\n* **World building.** If you're not a fan of world building then I'd gladly do it myself since I really like it. I'm not great at building magic systems though so I usually skip it all together, allowing the magic to simply exist. Otherwise, we'll do the world building together before and during the RP.\n* **Three pre-made fantasy OC's.** I have written three fantasy characters whose profiles you can find pinned on my Reddit account. If you'd like me to use any of those characters then just say the word.\n* **Custom character.** If my three OC's aren't to your liking I can create a custom character specifically for our RP.\n* **Detailed descriptions.** I really enjoy describing things in great detail. I loved reading about the trees and the cliffs when I read *Lord of the Rings* for the first time, if that gives you any inclination of how I work.\n* **Flexible writing.** If my loving descriptions of velveteen and wooden furniture is a bit overwhelming, please just tell me so. I don't mind altering my writing so you feel comfortable! To a certain extent, of course.\n* **General flexibility.** I might come off as strict however I'm really not that bad. We RP together not against each other so go ahead and tell me your thoughts and if there's anything you want me to change.\n\nThat's it for me then! If I've managed to catch your interest then please don't hesitate to DM me. In your DM I would love if you included a little introduction of yourself and a sample of your writing so I can get a good idea of your style and preferences.\n\nWell then,  \n*Ta ta\\~*",

            "selftext": "Hi amazing people! I'm looking for a rp partner who wants to explore a plot I've been thinking about for some while now. \n\nI'm 25+ myself so I would prefer if you're over 20, but I can do 18+ if you're really interested!\n\nThe plot:\nX made a deal with the devil hundreds of years ago. A deal that would let them be with their love, Y, for the rest of their life. But of course, there would be a twist. Y dies at the age of 25 and X has to look for them again in their next life.\n\nThis goes on for hundreds of years. X finds Y and know it's them, but Y doesn't know anything about their past. So X has to explain it to them for every lifetime. And also explain why they will die at the age of 25.\n\nThis plot has so much potential, playing throughout the history. Even modern world or even future. Maybe something happends? Maybe Y all of a sudden remeber X? Maybe X forgets? Who knows, let's figure it out!\n\n~~\nI'm looking for someone to play against my Male character. Your char can be F, M or NB. The interesting thing about this plot is that we can use different face claims, personalites, everything. It just ties up to this one thing.\n\nI enjoy talking to my partners OOC too, so I hope you're open for that too!\n\n~~\n\nIf this sounds interesting, send me a DM! I prefer roleplaying on discord. I will give you more info if you DM me. Please don't DM me if you're going to ghost me later. Communication is key. I'm looking for someone who can reply a few times a week, daily would be amazing but not mandatory.",

            "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nHello everyone,\n\n  \nBefore I get started I would like to talk a bit about myself. You can call me Moro, I'm a 21 year old male from Britain and I've been roleplaying now for four and a half, going on five years now. Recently I've been looking at starting a new roleplay and this setting has interested me for a while now.\n\nSo my current idea for this RP is a story focusing on a couple of Kingsglaive members and their experiences before, during and after the fall of Insomnia (the events of the movie). I'd like to write a personal story that builds up their relationship from soldiers to friends and eventually something more. That being said I don't want romance to be the whole plot, for me it works best as a secondary subplot to run alongside the events of the story as it unfolds and they share new experiences. This won't be a grandiose adventure, they'll be on the back foot, unsure of who to trust, running and hiding from an empire that wants to hunt them down, looking for allies and maybe wanting to strike back in their own way.\n\nThese are all just rough ideas at the moment and I'm sure we can discuss and finalise finer plot points in detail on discord.\n\nNow as for what I'm looking for; My ideal partner would be someone with a good grasp of the english language, someone who is ready and willing to discuss new ideas and bring their own to the table to drive the plot forward in a shared manner. As there is probably going to be romance at some point I'm only looking for people over 18, preferrably around my own age. Due to this being an established setting I am looking for someone with some knowledge of the world and the people and places within it. I'm by no means a Final Fantasy expert but I'm always willing to spend time reading and learning to make it a more enjoyable experience.\n\nIn terms of posting and writing I believe in quality over quantity, I wouldn't expect someone to write three paragraphs describing what their character is eating for breakfast but longer posts are welcome for more intricate detail when it comes to surroundings and setting. Write what you feel is necessary is what I'm getting at as long as we're not resorting to one word answers, they don't help when it comes to storytelling. I generally write in third person present or past tense. When it comes to post frequency I am looking for people who are interested and commited to telling a story, I understand that real life always comes first and I'm not asking for constant attention but one reply a week doesn't help all that much when it comes to long term engagement. That being said if you are going to be away or the RP isn't working for you then feel free to let me know, nobody likes being ghosted and I wouldn't do that to someone so I'd expect the same treatment.\n\nWith all that said I believe we've come to the end of this rather rambling post, if you are interested in this idea feel free to send me a message in my Reddit PMs and we can work from there. I look forward to hopefully hearing from some of you in the near future.  \n\n\nKind regards,  \n\n\nMorokei.",

I'm a semi-literate and long-term role-player that writes in the 3rd person and replies at LEAST once a day on Discord. I'm looking for someone obviously over the age of 18, has decent writing skills and wants to do something long-term and some world-building with me! \n\nWhen I get invested in a plot, I mean it. I use face claims, make playlists, image boards, etc.. I love talking with my partners and brainstorming as well, and I like to think that I'm friendly! Because I get so invested, if you're prone to ghosting, PLEASE DON'T WASTE EITHER OF OUR TIMES! The last thing I want is for either of us to get invested in something and then go ghost. If you have issues that you want to bring up, please let me know! If you have lost interest or IRL comes up, let me know! \n\nI only write on Discord, and please be ready to send a prompt if I ask for one! Go ahead and send me a DM if you're interested and we can talk there! \n\nOkay now into the FUN STUFF! \n\n\\- I'm open for FxM arranged marriage concepts of FxF concepts. \n\n\\- I really enjoy historical timelines and plots with a little bit of fantasy peppered in, but I'm also dandy with straight up historical fiction, or we could do something more modern or even futuristic with an arranged marriage.",

            "selftext": "Hello! As the request says, I am looking to perhaps do a 1x1 roleplay, from the Sailor Moon fandom.  Quite honestly, I believe that Sailor Moon can be one of the most fun things, to be able to roleplay, if both partners know it. I know the series decently well, but not the best, but I am willing to do whatever research, in order to satisfy my partner\n\n I am planning to use my original character, for which I have a Sailor Moon version of him, which I can link to you in PMs. But, I can also roleplay as a few of the Sailor Guardians as well (mostly Mercury, Jupiter and Venus). I would be looking for someone who can do canon characters, but I can roleplay as multiple characters, if needed.  \n\n I am also a semi-literate roleplayer, which means I mostly do 3-5 lines, but IS able to go past 5+, or even 10 + lines. I would be looking for someone who is around the same literacy as myself , and can do at least around 3-5 lines. If you choose to write more, that is perfectly fine by me. \n\nFinally, I LOVE creative stories and whatnot, at least when it comes to the Sailor Moon universe. I also have a basic plot in mind, which I can tell you in PMs, and which we can work on together.  I will also let you know of my rules and anything else you need to know\n\nSo, if you are interested, simply reply to this message or DM me. Thank you very much, and I look forward to roleplaying with you!",

            "selftext": "This will be an AU of the game Arcana. \n\nMy idea is fairly simple. Lucio is still the Count of Vesuvia and still hold fights at the coliseum. Although, now it is mostly for sport such as fighting and killing dangerous creatures whom are captured first. On one of his few journeys South, having his guards do everything for him, he encounters Tarske Forest and within it the Protector. \n\nLucio and his guards parade through Vesuvia with the Protector bound to their horses, dragged towards the coliseum. Its clear to all what he plans for this creature. A new battle would commence. \n\nMuriel, who is free from Lucio along with his forget me spell, would often enter the coliseum where the animals were held. Wanting nothing more than to soothe them before their demise or free them if he can. \n\nTonight, he would encounter whatever it was being held in the dungeons below. To his surprise it wasn't at all what he expected. \n\nIt was humanoid, covered in thin vibrant green fur. The legs weren't human but goat like with brown hooves. Their upper body was indeed human like however, the bridge of their nose flat and the nose itself feline like. Their face rounded along with large sapphire eyes. Their ears long and elf like but feathery. The hair a shade darker than its fur and long, it reached their fluffy deer like tail. Their finger tips were pointed and almost claw like. \n\nIt was a staggering sight to say the least. This is the Protector of the Forest. Perhaps he didn't know or perhaps he did. Whatever the case might be, this is where their journey begins. \n\nI have a few rules before we start. \n\u2022 Must be 18+, I am an adult \n\u2022 Play as multiple roles \n\u2022 Add on to the story\n\u2022 Role-play in third person\n\u2022 Must have Telegram\u00a0 \n\nReplies will be slow, so please be patient. You don't have to worry about writing many paragraphs, one paragraph will be good enough. I'm striving to have fun! I need someone to play as Muriel, it doesn't matter what gender you actually are. I will be playing as the Protector. My character has no gender although they are a tad feminine. They are a magical being. \n\nI want this role-play to have lots of fluff and dark moments. \n\nI hope this interests you! Looking forwards to any who messages!",

            "selftext": "Hi everyone! Hope you're having a great day :)\n\nSo today I'm looking for a MHA roleplay that focuses on, you guessed it, All Might! I've been really curious about his backstory and, seeing as we have barely enough information about him, I thought why not create our own story? Taking what limited info we have on him, I'm sure we can weave a wonderful story together!\n\nTo be more specific, I'm looking to play as a young Yagi Toshinori and explore what trials he had to go through to become the Symbol of Peace we all know and love today. As for your character, I don't mind anyone at all. From a lover OC from his childhood, to a canon character that had a huge impact on his life or even to a DM that walks me through a great story of an upcoming hero, you can be whoever you like!\n\nSome important things to note are that I write only on Discord, in 3rd person, and write long paragraphs (~500 words.) I am a *huge* lover of angst and dark themes so these are to be expected to come up, since I like to focus on the many tragedies he had to face. Lastly, for NSFW, I'd rather we avoid it.\n\nThat's about it! In your message, include whether you're caught up with the manga, so I know you've read the whole thing. Cheers! :D",

It's not exactly the most original setting but it gets the job done and has some unique worldbuilding that I've done.\n\nOur characters live in a segregated Warsaw in 2068 in 31 Dystrykt. The European Union was dissolved in 2037 and as of 2060, the Polish government has been under the control of the Z\u0142oty \u015awit, a far-right authoritarian party. As per the agenda of the Z\u0142oty \u015awit, all members of society that are not ethnically Polish or make less than z\u014275,000 a year is sent to live in the outer districts of Warsaw.\n\nThere are many radical insurgencies that have sprung up in Poland by 2068, such as the Polacy dla Konfederacji Rosyjskiej or the underground Partii Komunistycznej. Even within the PdKR and PK there are many splinter factions, such as the Rosyjska Unia Europy and Czarna Armia Polski.\n\nI hope for there to be a mix of political intrigue, action, adventure, and romance, as well as cooperative world-building the longer we write together!

Please read before messaging.\n\n- im a girl who prefers to rp as my male ocs and I'd like to rp with others who are not cismen please\n- 3rd person, past tense, 1-3+ paragraphs depending on the situation\n- prefer to rp with people 21+ but 18 at the least\n- I prefer to not use faceclaims. Descriptions and/or drawings are fine\n- NSFW welcome and preferred but not as a focus. It should be a compliment to the romance.\n- angst, drama always welcome! Willing to rp dark themes too but if you're not ok with it, i will respect that\n- cliche and cheesy tropes/plots are also great \ud83d\ude0a\n- discord only\n- do not expect me to come up with everything. Lets talk and discuss together!\n- im est time zone. You don't need to be the same but it'd be nice if we weren't on opposite sides of the world",

I don't mind it taking place anywhere along the original timeline of the actual show or set in the same canonverse but with different plots, or simply focusing on the characters.\n\n**I can double.** I can RP as Erwin Smith, Hange Zoe, Eren Yeager, Mikasa Ackerman, Jean Kirstein, Annie Leonhardt, Reiner Braun, Armin Arlert, and more. Just ask!\n\nI'm looking specifically for a **Levi Ackerman**. Your IRL gender doesn't matter to me, as long as you can portray his character well. If Levi Ackerman isn't your forte, I can settle for Eren or Armin, or even Annie.\n\nI have a few plots in mind, so if this interests you, please feel free to message me! Also, please be 18+ and literate. I'll explain more in private.\n\nSee ya!",

            "selftext": "Hi, all! I'm looking to DM a Cyberpunk 2077 story with someone. This story will ideally incorporate all of the various themes that Cyberpunk has to offer and realistically portray that world in our writing. I've had too many bad experiences writing with other males, so I'm strictly only looking for female partners. I am also looking for someone that can respond at least three - five times a day. All other variables are flexible!\n\nI recently finished the story of Cyberpunk 2077 and, despite the game's issues, I need more of that setting! Frankly, if I could inject all of the aesthetics and ambience directly into my veins, that'd be an easier go of it but I'll have to settle with telling some stories instead!\n\nAs stated, I write exclusively as a DM. My aim is to bring a world to life with memorable and original characters, matched with a deep and compelling story. I put a lot of effort into my story telling and I don't feel that I can reach my potential with typical 1-on-1 partnerships. So, with that being said, I'm searching for one female partner (preferably with a female character) to explore Night City with my cast of characters!\n\nNaturally, all of the characters here will be original.\n\nAdditionally, I'm not trying to re-create a story similar to the game. I'm not necessarily seeking action! Even if our story is primarily drama and charactet development, I'll enjoy it just as much. Here are some starting plot ideas:\n\n* Gang Setting: Your character is a prospective member of one of the many gangs of Night City.\n* Corporate Paradise: Your character is a low, but respectable, Corpo. But how will they fare when they're forced into the dirty streets of Night City?\n* Nomad: You're not from Night City, but it was the only logical place to go. After spending your life on so many bad roads, you've learned that they all lead to Night City.\n* Civilian: Civilian, non-combatant, and peasant are all names that you have been called. Still, anyone can become a Legend in Night City.\n* Prison: You've just served five years in prison for a crime you didn't commit. Now with two days between you and freedom, you're not sure you'll survive to breath the fresh smog of Night City.\n\nAs a DM, I encourage a sense of danger within our story. I'll never seek to permanently harm/kill your character! However, consequences do add a real sense of joy to the story for my past partners and myself. We can discuss this more if you're interested!\n\nFinally, due to the setting and themes of Cyberpunk, I would prefer my partner to be 18+.\n\nIf you're interested, please let me know!",

            "selftext": "\nHello everyone! I\u2019m looking for a long term, literate roleplay partner that I can flex my writing skills with! Below are some things about me and what I\u2019m looking for in a partner. \n\n\u2022I usually write anywhere from 2-5 paragraphs, and I would prefer if my partner could match my length at the very minimum. No one liners please. \n\n\u2022I am only interested in MxF pairings, with me playing the male. \n\n\u2022I am open to most genres, but simple things like a slice of life romance rp get really boring to me fast. If we\u2019re going to do something like that, I\u2019d like a plot with an interesting premise, or we could add another genre onto it. \n\n\u2022I am a relatively slow replier. My response time will range anywhere from 30 minutes to a day or two, depending on how engaged I am with the story. \n\n\u2022Must be 18+.\n\n\u2022I usually roleplay on discord, but if you don\u2019t have discord or prefer using another app or website, I\u2019d be happy to roleplay wherever you\u2019d like. \n\nWhat I\u2019m looking for in a partner:\n\n\u2022Please don\u2019t be unresponsive or \nuncommunicative! I like ooc chatter and just general communication between me and my partner. Be fun, get creative! Make playlists, mood-boards, etc.\n\n\u2022Well written characters. Our characters need to be three dimensional and fleshed out with interesting and unique personalities, quirks, and backstories. \n\n\u2022Be literate. Good spelling, punctuation, and grammar are a must. \n\nGenerally, I am open to most genres and plots, although I do have a few that I\u2019ve been wanting to try recently. I feel like a crime/drama based plot could be fun, maybe a sort of forbidden love style of story between a cop/deceptive and a criminal/mafia member.\n\n I\u2019ve also been really interested in \u201cspace westerns\u201d recently, in the same vein of shows like Cowboy Bebop and similar mediums like Cyberpunk, so doing something like that could be fun. \n\nGenerally, I prefer romance to be incorporated in some level, but it doesn\u2019t have to be the main focus of the roleplay if you\u2019d prefer that. If you have any other ideas, I\u2019d be happy to work something out with you! If this interests you, please send me a chat or message!",

She works as a waitress during the day and spends her evenings chasing her dreams. She has a boyfriend who isn\u2019t the best, but supports her well enough?*\n*She finds out about an audition for a theatre play through a friend and decides to audition. The director is a young, up and coming talent who\u2019s known to be unorthodox, brilliant, creative and\u2026 sometimes goofy?*\n\nSo, that\u2019s it. I know it isn\u2019t great, but I promise I\u2019m a much better writer (just terrible at writing prompts). I\u2019m looking for someone to play the director and please, please feel free to change their personality however you want to. This roleplay will include slow burn romance, love triangles (though her current boyfriend will be an NPC\u2026 no need to worry about him), some comedy and lots of drama. This story will be about the relationship they share and how they get closer to each other as a girl used to boredom finds herself falling for her happy-go-lucky employer.\n\nI\u2019m eighteen, AWST timezone, write 3-4 paragraphs and can reply once a day or two. I try to be very active OOC and enjoy character and world-building while giving my partner as much freedom as they want. I only Roleplay on Discord. Sorry!\n\nYou have to be eighteen and a little mature. Also, please don\u2019t ghost me.\n\n\nThat\u2019s all. Thanks!",

            "selftext": "Hey there. I am looking for someone interested in a literate high fantasy or SciFi setting. I particularly enjoy political drama and world-building. However, I do also enjoy a good amount of combat/romance/drama to be present throughout the plot.\n\nFor Fantasy, I enjoy a setting which incorporated multiple races and has some magical elements. I particularly enjoy the DnD/Pathfinder and Warcraft races, but I am willing to hear more. I usually play these setting pretty open-ended and let our characters goals steer the story, however, I have a few ideas on how to start.\n\nFor SciFi, I mostly enjoy near-future SciFi settings, which are somewhat grounded and moderately realistic. However, I am not looking for a 100% hard SciFi. Some rough ideas I have for this setting are: Penal Mining Colony goes rogue, dystopian future earth, space adventure to complete goals, Mars v Earth war (both humans, focusing on cultural differences of the planets). This list is not extensive and I have more ideas if you want to hear more.\n\nFeel free to message me to discuss more. I usually prefer discord to chat I don't have a hard word count, but I do prefer it to be multi-paragraph for the most part.\n\nI am also in GMT 0.",

            "selftext": "Hello!  I have recently regained my interest for The Rising of the Shield Hero,  and I wanted to try making an RP based around it! It has unfortunately  been a bit since I've last seen the anime, as I watched it on release,  so I may get one or two things wrong.\n\nThe  RP will be a fully OC universe, even to the point of some of the  cardinal heroes' weapons being different. However, the overall system  and such would be the same. Our characters are cardinal heroes, with two  NPCs being the two other cardinal heroes. Alternatively, we could also  have more cardinal heroes for more variety, so rather than 4 we could  have 5 or 6 or something. I'm up for basically anything as long as it  has the basic concept of the shield hero anime.  \nThe RP will be action  focused, and though I'm alright with basically any genre, romance is a  no for me as I'm bad at writing it due to lack of experience IRL, so I  wouldn't be able to make the feeling of love realistic.\n\nThe RP will be held on discord. If you find this interesting, feel free to PM me :)",

I'm looking for help in writing a Fullmetal Alchemist fanfic but I'm having issues doing so.   \n\n\nThe basic plot: Meet Rosanna, or Rose as she goes by. Rose's mom was Ishbal and her dad was a state alchemist, both which were killed during the ishbal war, Rose escaped thanks to her father now wandering the streets in hiding with her dog in which she found named patches. She travels to learn more about alchemy but ends up getting involved in a bigger mess than she's ready for when she runs into the Elric brothers and meets a certain sin named Envy.   \n\n\n  \nYou can include your oc, make a sibling for my oc. The story can be talked more about over discord if you're interested -Discord only please!-  \n\n\nI'm looking for someone who writes in the third person, someone who write decent responses -Not talking about, I'm looking for someone whose willing to play Envy -Again your oc can be in the story, and if you wanna pair your oc with a canon character feel free to- this stuff will be discussed moreover discord.   \n\n\nThis would be a long term RP until after the story is completed. If you're interested let me know with the details of your oc -if they're with a canon character and stuff- and hopefully, we can work together on this!!",

A bit to get out of the way beforehand; I'm a semi-lit writer, and depending on how much I like the story, I can write quite a lot! I almost always mirror how much my partner writes. (I prefer at least a paragraph,- meaning five sentences,- so I have enough to work with.) I write in third person only, and I ask that you please do the same if you want to write with me. Also; for the safety of myself and my partner, I ask that you and your character are of age. (I'm 18NB, myself, and I prefer my partners in the 18-23 range. I'm flexible on this, though)\n\nShips (starred characters are who I would be writing):\n\n[ Jujutsu Kaisen ]\n- *Gojo/Geto \u2661\u2661\u2661\n- *Gojo/Nanami \u2661\u2661\u2661\n- *Gojo/Sukuna \u2661\u2661\u2661\n- \n- [Note: Gojo x Sukuna might work best in some scenario in which Sukuna doesn't share a body with Itadori, lmao]\n-\nDon't see a ship you're interested in? Ask me; I might have skipped it.\n\nI write on Discord, as it's the best platform I've found for roleplay. PM me for my tag :-)\n\nIf you have any plots you've been really wanting to do, let me know! I myself am especially partial to angsty and/or dark plots!\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to send them my way! I don't bite!\n\nI hope to RP with you soon!",

            "selftext": "Good afternoon! My name is Kire, I am 30 years old and looking for people 24 or older to Roleplay with - the age requirement is due to my personal taste, not for any other reason. I just don't feel comfortable talking to anyone under 24.\n\nI've been Roleplaying since I was 9 years old back on Neopets and DeviantArt. I am looking for someone strictly literate who knows how to write a story, not an essay. I don't care how many paragraphs you write, I just want a progressing story with depth and excitement!\n\nMy rules are quite simple: be literate, be willing to talk outside of RP (OOC for example), be patient (I work full time and go to college full time), and be open! \n\nI have a couple of fandoms I'm super interested in doing: \n- Overwatch\n- Left4Dead2\n- Villainous\n- Yu-Gi-Oh\n- Team Fortress 2\n- Homestuck\n- Boku No Hero Academia\n- Marvel\n- Borderlands (1, 2, Pre, Tales, and 3)\n- OFF\n- Persona (3, 4, 5)\n- Phoenix Wright\n- I have many others, just ask!\n\nI have a few ideas for AUs that I really, really want to do! \n\n- PIRATES (Character X is a pirate. Character Y is a rich brat of the royal family. We can totally add mythical creatures into this like sirens, mermaids, a kraken, etc!) \n\n- DEMON HUNTER ( Character X is a hunter and Character Y is a demon that Character X sealed away to be their partner - Y doesn't want to be X's partner at all and does everything in his power to defy X. More brainstorming later)\n\n- Dystopian (Basically the world has ended because bees died out and now the rich are basically living in a utopia above the clouds with man-made bees and the rest of the world lives under the smog cloud where Honey and anything made by bees - fruit, vegetables, etc - is currency.)\n\n- Medieval Fantasy ( brainstorm!!!! )\n\nThat's all I've got! I RP over Discord so please send me a small snippet of how you RP and your discord name so we can chat more! \ud83d\ude0a",

For this rp, it wouldn't have to be in russia, but the themes that I want to explore would be that of a supernatural mystery within the town, and the strange conditions and customs of it, alien to the doctor.
