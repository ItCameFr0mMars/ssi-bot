The apprenticeship can be an official part of a formal education, something that comes about naturally, something taken on reluctantly, something deemed necessary due to a specific situation, or anything else that fits.\n\nI want to roleplay as a student or apprentice in a story with both dark academic and romantic themes. I\u2019m open to any sort of story that falls within that realm. I prefer to start with a basic idea and them build onto it as things progress. I\u2019m also happy to hear about any plots or ideas you may have. For the setting, I adore medieval fantasy, but something pseudo-Victorian would work as well. I\u2019m not typically into modern stories, but may make an exception if you\u2019ve got a good idea that fits the theme well. he darker elements could involve magic, the occult, the supernatural, or even something a little Lovecraftian in nature. I\u2019m open to suggestions.\n\nThings can take place in a university setting, a mannor/castle, some sort of shop dealing with relevant items, on the open road, or anywhere else that makes sense for the particular story. The apprenticeship can be an official part of a formal education, something that comes about naturally, something taken on reluctantly, something deemed necessary due to a specific situation, or anything else that fits.\n\nI\u2019m not currently feeling playing against outright evil or ridiculously flirty, or relentlessly unpleasant types. Using these traits in moderation is fine, though. Beyond that, you have full creative control behind your character. My own characters tend to be a little eccentric in some way or another and have unhappy pasts that influence how they deal with their emotions (for better or worse). Beyond that, they can have all sorts of different personalities. If there\u2019s a type of character you like playing against, let me know and I\u2019ll be happy to play it for you!\n\nAbout Me:\n\nI\u2019d like to keep my own posts down to a paragraph or two. I can and sometimes will write more if the story calls for it, but generally don\u2019t want to. You\u2019re free to post whatever makes you happy. For the most part, I reply daily. There are days can do multiple replies and some days I might skip. My frequency has nothing to do with you as a writer, but with my mood and energy level on any given day. I will keep you updated if something prevents me posting for more than a day or two. You are welcome to post as often as you\u2019d like. I\u2019m really just looking to keep things low-key in general.  I am over 18 and require the same of my partners.\n\nI use discord and only play in 3rd person. My rp style is very character driven. I am happy to play as many side-characters or npcs as needed. I like to include thoughts and feelings in my posts. I love having a lot of dialogue thrown in. I am more interested in how characters react to the story than the story itself (though it is still important!). I am the type who will care just as much about your character as my own and I tend to notice and remember the little details about them. I don\u2019t require my partners take the same approach, but it would be nice to find someone like-minded.\n\nHopefully someone out there is interested. If that\u2019s you, please let me know. I\u2019d prefer that your reply to this add include a little information about either you, your ideas/plots, or a character you\u2019d like to play/like me to play. It just helps me sort out some of the more spammy replies.",

He had now circled around the house for the fourth time now, but eventually, when he walked past the window, the side of his eye captured an image which made him stop. Just across from him, behind another window which peered into the calm, clean, white neighbouring house\u2019s hallway, and in the middle of this large and decorated passage, a woman stood, she was leaning against a wall, her right hand holding her left arm, and her left hand holding her mouth shut as she cried, she cried with a muted sadness, she cried unfairly, she cried in shameful loneliness, and Dan stood there\u2026 a world apart from her with his father\u2019s sentences flying into the air. She finally lifted her eyes, making Dan\u2019s soft and intrigued gaze meet her hurt and fierce look, and it filled him with a feeling he had never had, not much of a feeling in reality, something more of an instinct. Before Dan could pretend to look away and carry on with his walk, the woman had already started darting away, disappearing into the house.  \n \u201cyeah sure, we\u2019ll talk later, bye, dad\u201d Dan hung up, then immediately went upstairs to his room before the boredom could get to him, he instantly got his journal out from under his bed, his sponsor had told him that writing was what helped him deal with withdrawals and boredom, boredom being the biggest threat\u2026especially here in his mother\u2019s empty suburban house.  \n \u201cEntry 86: The Pretty Eyes of a Crying lady\u201d He wrote on a new page. &gt;&gt;\n\nHey, I\u2019ve been wanting to try something new, well something I haven\u2019t tried before in RP. I\u2019m looking for a semi-literate/literate partner for a story of an unlikely slow burn romance with drama sprinkled in the middle of it. The snippet is only a little indication of the story, the atmosphere and the writing style I\u2019m looking for but of course we could discuss these elements and change them, you could write any sort of character, all I\u2019m interested in really is the idea of two vulnerable, hurt, and \u201coutcast\u201d people who find comfort, complicity, and eventually love even though there is nothing which could tell that these two people would have any sort of chemistry or implication with each other. So this idea of a young troubled man falling for the unhappy married(or divorced, or lonely, or depressed\u2026) older woman  living next to him kinda incorporates that, but again, I\u2019m not married to this coupling so please don\u2019t shy away from pitching in your ideas. There might be some heavy themes treated in this story though, so just a headsup.",

I haven't in a couple years, and wanting to get back into it. The reason I hadn't RPed in a while is because I was in a relationship, but now because I am going through a horrible breakup, I am looking to get back into it, and also because having a few people to talk to along with the RP would be nice, and maybe help me keep sane.\n\nI prefer to do slice of life, but willing to do some fandoms I guess. Just shoot me what you want to do and we can go from there. Don't really care about time zone or post length. Just give me more than 3 words, and we will be good to go.\n\nDiscord would be ideal, but willing to do KIK or Email in a pinch.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you.",

I\u2019m looking for a long-time partner who can I possibly become friends with!! \n\nI\u2019m not particularly picky with requirements for my partner, but they must be 18+, be at least semi-experienced with roleplaying, have decent grammar, and willing to match my length. I am not looking for a short term partner or someone who will ghost me for no reason (bruh moment). I don\u2019t mind if you afk for days but just make sure to let me know! I would also prefer a female partner due to past experiences but I can make exceptions. \n\nAbout me: I\u2019m a college freshman who has been roleplaying for 7+ plus years. My schedule can get pretty hectic, but I try to respond (usually in 4-5 paragraphs) several times a week or daily. It just all depends. I prefer to play and main female, but I will play a variety of characters, ethnicity genders. I\u2019m also LGBT friendly and bisexual myself and many of my characters are non-straight! If you\u2019re anti-LGBT, or racist please don\u2019t respond to my post. Save it for the bs meeting. \n\nI mainly like to roleplay horror, supernatural, psychological terror, and mafia-based themes. I can try other themes, but granted I may be a little rusty.  I do tend to incorporate romance into my stories, and a sucker for love triangles (granted, if it contributes plot wise). I tend to go into more darker themes but if you have limits please let me know!\n\nI love to world build, send memes, sketch our characters (try my best to anyways), make playlists or just chat about random stuff! Thanks! \n\nPs: I may not respond right away due to classes please bare with me haha.",

People go about their daily lives, raising families, going to work and making dinner. Children cry at night, afraid of shadows or the monster under the bed. Parents sooth their children\u2019s fears, saying \u201cThere is nothing to be afraid of. There are no monsters.\u201d They are wrong. Our reality is stretched thin, and the veil is torn. Monsters, shadows, demons, devils, spirits, conspiracies, and aliens all exist, hidden from our normal lives. They co-exist with us. Watching us. Using us. Controlling governments. Preying on us. \n\nWelcome to Pinebox, a sleepy little East Texas town with more than its share of trouble. Whether it\u2019s snake cultists running the local bar or vengeful spirits haunting the high school boys locker room, there always seems to be some sort of trouble brewing just below the surface. At the heart of it all, lies East Texas University. ETU, as it is called by the Townies has its fair share of strange happenings. Every year students go missing at that place. \n\nThere is something amiss at ETU. Can you help figure out what it is?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot is special to me. I have been working on it for a while now. It is based on multiple sources but the main influences are Buffy the Vampire slayer, Funcom\u2019s The Secret World, and the Chronicles of Darkness. The main idea is a group or pair of students fighting against mind controlling beetles, cursed beer, or an evil Taco Truck to name a few monsters that they will have to fight. The theme of trying to save the world while trying to study for final exams. I have always loved Southern Gothic horror. \n\n\nMy character would be some sort of character in over his head with the monsters and all that. We could have as many characters as we want.  I really want to do this plot and can do anything. I even have a secret method of making plots for this idea. So no two games would be the same.  It involves playing cards and a table. \n\n\nYou can play whatever you want. The main point is keeping the other students from the monsters what want to kill them.\n\n\nI am not a fan of gory horror and will take as many partners as I can find. I\u2019m a ten year veteran of Rping and I only rp with people who are 18+. I cannot emphasize this enough. \n\nI generally play male characters but I\u2019m open to almost anything for a partner. . \n\nPm me or message me here!\n\nPs I am always looking for more players.",

I\u2019m currently in the market for some new awesome partners and I thought I\u2019d throw some ideas around! \n\n\\~more like guidelines than actual rules\\~\n\n* I prefer to write in 3rd person but I can do first person for a more intense experience. \n* I used to play more male characters but I can play any gender.\n* Any romantic pairing is fine with me as well. Surprise me. \n* I am semi-literate to a full blown novelist (k, maybe or maybe not) depending on the RP and what the scene needs. \n\n\\~ideas factory\\~ \n\n* Fantasy/SOL: Welcome to the Mystic Memoriam. A place of dreams, adventures, and fairytales...at least, for someone. We, humble folk, don\u2019t have the time nor the resources to go wandering through the foggy wildness or go hunting the pack of ogres. We do have the resources to serve our guests a nice pint and have them spill all of their troubles! Join me in the sparkling life of the RPG bartenders! We might just find ourselves in a bit of adventure yet! \n* Crime/Drama/Romance?: I\u2019m all about angsty men/women dressed in leather including crime lords, pirates, or your everyday thief. Want to join me in my elaborate heist? Fine! Want me to capture you on my pirate ship? Sounds great! You like noir? I got a femme fatale just for you. \n* Want to do something else with someone that clearly has too much sarcasm? LMK. \n\n\\~I do rp on Discord, thx\\~",

It sounds intimidating, but the name is deceiving. All it really means is that her demon magic is chaotic. She casts a spell and there\u2019s no telling what will happen. It could be something useless, helpful, or harmful. Her personality is friendly, curious, impulsive, fearless, and she gets bored easily. She is mostly Human looking, but all of her is chalk-white and she lacks pupils.\n\nI\u2019m open to pairing her up with any sort of character you like. You can be good or evil. Have fun with it. I\u2019m always very happy to add romance to my stories, but it\u2019s not super important. Any kind of relationship will do. I\u2019m picturing a traveling adventure theme where the two are magically connected to each other, but am happy to hear other ideas.\n\nI\u2019m open to them meeting in a number of ways. A summoning, a cursed object, a curse, an attempt to nobly sacrifice oneself to a demon, being the first person she sees in the Human world, someone else pawning her off on your character, etc.\n\nI\u2019m 18+. Please be the same. 3rd person RP only. RP will be done over discord. I can commit to posting 1 to 3 paragraphs almost every day. I might be able to do more, but no promises there. I only ask that you be adaptive and give me something to work with. There are no other requirements.\n\nPlease send me some information about the character you want to play. I\u2019m also down to hear any ideas you might have. Thanks for reading!",

This isn't a situation where you can convince me to get Kik or roleplay on Reddit. I'm sorry, but that's just what I feel comfortable with and I find the best way to RP\n\n* I'm very length friendly! If you want to write multiple paragraphs consistently that's great! If you're more of a one paragraph kind of person that is also great! As long as the story can be furthered I don't have a preference for length.\n\n* Spencer Reid is who I usually play, both because that\u2019s the character I\u2019m best at embodying and because I enjoy playing him the most. I can also play Aaron Hotchner or Jennifer Jareau. I\u2019ve never played Morgan or Prentiss before, but I\u2019m willing to try to play them if that\u2019s what you prefer!  \n\n* Canon x Canon is something I am always seeking for, but I\u2019m good to play Canon x OC as well since that\u2019s what more people are looking for. Just let me know what you\u2019d like! \n\nWe can figure out the plot before roleplaying based on preference, character choice, etc. I'm really flexible on what kind of plot we do also. If you're interesting shoot me a DM or put a comment so that I can DM you! Thank you for taking the time to read and I hope to RP with you soon. :)",

            "selftext": "Hello there! Today I\u2019m looking for something quite honestly a bit mundane, but in no way boring. Slice of life is a genre I don\u2019t usually play, but I have a few roleplays going on with all the action, adventure, and intrigue I could ever want. Today I\u2019d like to find a partner that just wants to cozy up and fantasize about an alternate, but realistic life with me.\n\nAs far as ideas go, I have a few basic ones for my character. One is that he\u2019d be a small shop owner. Book shop, coffee shop, etc. Your character would come in regularly and they\u2019d form a connection. Another idea I had would be playing a single father, and you\u2019d play my son\u2019s teacher! That one would deal a bit more with grief and overcoming it, along with the usual stresses of parenting.\n\nI\u2019m also very open to basic ideas like friends to lovers, college roommates, coworkers, etc. and fleshing them out and making them our own.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested, just shoot me a message!",

I am also horrendously slow and do need time to respond. I try my best to respond within the day or need two days. \n\nI just expect boundaries to be respected with whomever I'm role-playing with. Anything that involves controlling each other's character or doing anything romantically/sexually without explicit consent is completely out of the question. Please be respectful! You can ask me and we can discuss it.\n\nHowever, if you have a plot twist that will move the story in any way that doesn't include doing something to our characters, I welcome it. I want out roleplay not to be stagnant and enjoyable for both parties. \n\nI understand if you ghost and will not contact you if you do. If you're bored and still want to continue, please let me know! We can do something else.\n\nI'm really interested in doing a modern paranormal roleplay with vampires/ witches/ demons/ fae and all sorts of creatures! \n\nI kind of have an idea in mind but if you have any, please let me know!

            "selftext": "Hello all! Yet again, I'm making a semi-specific post because I have a specific fandom in mind. As you can guess by the title, that fandom is Sonic the Hedgehog! I crafted a new character design last night and I wanted to test drive 'er. Of course, if you don't care for romance, adventure, and/or fantasy (note the 'or'), then this probably isn't the post for you. Before I get terribly in-depth... Yes, I'm willing to double and... Please have a decent understanding of English.\n\nTime for me to get more into this... So, first off, y'can call me Writer. I'm 19F (soon to be 20!), and have written multiple books in the past three-four years (eight last I checked, all fanfiction). I roleplay in a paragraph/literate/semi-novella style, third person, past tense! You don't have to match this, I promise. Just give me at least a paragraph equivalent per reply and I'll be happy. I am a college student with a part time job, so there may be days where I don't answer or my answers are *h i g h l y* sporadic.\n\nI'm fine with RP'ing in any of the following Sonic canons: X, Unleashed, Brotherhood: The Dark Chronicles, 06, Forces, Boom, Movie 2020. I also have knowledge of SatAM, Underground, and AoStH which can be tossed into whatever mix we decide upon (unless you want it to strictly be one reality or another).\n\nI'm not strictly tied to any one romantic interest for the character I've made (her name is Node), so feel free to tell me what characters you'd be fine RP'ing opposite her (and I can play nearly any character opposite yours if you want to double, so long as I have basic knowledge of them). If you want a sort-of list of characters I'd prefer to ship with Node, then... Here y'go (bold is the ones I want the most, italics is just under, neither is 'I could see this happening I guess?'): **Sonic**, *Shadow*, **Mephiles**, **Blaze**, *Rouge*, Chaos, *Metal Sonic*, **Emerl**, Wave, *Shade*.\n\nI tend to be a major fluff-magnet when I RP, so that may come up a bit from me in terms of plots- I also like angst (but the kind where one gets injured and the other helps? Stuff like that-). If you have any plot ideas, let me know! We can probably work out what we want to do easily. I tend to be a more by-the-seat-of-my-pants person, and while I know it sounds weird... I like roleplaying through a franchise, but with the additional character(s) (the 's' for if you want to add some more insanities). It's interesting to see the changes that take place over time!\n\nAnd so that you know what kind of character you'd be up against: I'd be RP'ing as a self-insert (kinda, she was born in a different place, college doesn't exist on her mobius, and she's... Well, a mobian). If you want to RP as a self-insert as well, feel free. So long as you give me a character doc for your OC/self-insert, I'll probably be happy.\n\nLike usual, I'm not really going to tag a plot to this post since plots morph and change per partner.- If you're interested in an RP with me in the Sonic franchise.. Hit me up! I plan to try to make the RP long-term, but it's alright if it's not. I hope to hear from you soon (and I really hope I didn't leave anything out)! :D",

Then the site got wiped and reset and I kinda stopped. I'm happy to share examples of characters I made back then as I know how to find them. I'm also happy to share a short story I've written as an example of my writing style. I can match length. I am fine with any genre though I mainly did fantasy when I used to rp. I can adapt to your ideas or we can brainstorm one together. Anyone feel free to message be and I'll happily share my Discord.",

Instead of playing as the player character from the games we would play as some of our favorite Villagers but Human! (Obviouly). They would become mostly human but maintain their animal features (i.e a cat villager would have their ears and tail). I dont really have an idea for setting, probably in a town like the older games. I'm open to drama and plenty of romance! \n\nHMU if your interested",

I roleplay in third person, past tense (around 5-6 paragraphs per response.)\n\nI can roleplay a lot of canons, and I am looking for someone who can also play some when the time calls for them. \n\nI have an OC in mind, so message me with the idea you had for your OC, and we can plot more from there. I'm not looking to ship my OC with any canons, but perhaps our OC's can form some sort of friendship. \n\nI'm all caught up with the show (not the manga), and we can begin RPing at any point along the timeline, I don't really mind. I have a few plots I want to try out but you can always suggest some of your ideas too, and hopefully we can make something wonderful and long-term together.\n\nLooking forward to all your messages!",

Sorry!\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0Must be able to reply at least a few times each week. I don't need you to tell me your schedule or when you're going somewhere, but just need you to be able to commit to the movement of the story.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0Must be literate! I like at least two paragraphs per post! Even if things are moving quickly, I still expect this as it gives us at least some background and character thought. I will often write more though. \n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0Must be nice! We don't have to be friends, but I am chatty soo...\n\n\ud83d\udcf7If we are going to be doing a Fandom story, please be upfront in telling me how complete your knowledge is of the subject. I like to be sort of detail oriented.\n\n\\*\\*Guidelines :\\*\\*\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0Off the bat, I don't play straight guys in romantic situations. The only time I will play a straight guy is if the character is fully needed, or romance isn't involved. Every time I try to play one, they turn into a jerk.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0Playing more than one character is fine. I will also double up if you want me to play a certain character, as long as I think I can play them.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0I love romance. I just do, I'm sappy like that. This being said, I don't like stories where they just automatically are in love. This has a few exceptions, but most likely won't happen unless the story idea is really good.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0I'm also interested in like family style stories, as far as non-romance goes.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0I like to add real life themes into my stories. This is one, because I like drama, and two, because perfect stories in perfect worlds are no fun.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0My only triggers are only triggers when portrayed incorrectly. These are mental health issues, invisible diseases, and suicide. I will call you out on these things and stop the story if they are misrepresented. This is because incorrect portrayal of these things is something I have to deal with on a daily basis. I call people out in real life too. Constantly.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0Speaking of the above point, I do get sick quite often. This is just more of a heads up.\n\n\\*\\*Ships :\\*\\*\n\n(My characters will be in the astericks.)\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0Star Wars\n\n\\\\- \\*OC\\* x OC \\\\\\*\n\n\\\\- \\*OC\\* x Poe \\\\\\*\n\n\\\\- \\*OC\\* x Hux\n\n\\\\- \\*OC\\* x Kylo\n\n\\\\- \\*OC\\*\u00a0x Anakin\n\n\\\\-\u00a0\\*Hux\\* x Kylo\n\n\\\\- \\*Rey\\*\u00a0x Kylo\n\n\\\\- \\*Jyn\\* x Cassian \\\\\\*\n\n\\\\- \\*Finn\\* x Poe\n\n\\\\- \\*Padme\\* x Anakin\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0Star Trek\\\\\\*\n\n\\\\- \\*OC\\* x OC\n\n\\\\- \\*OC\\* x Jim\n\n\\\\- \\*OC\\* x Bones\n\n\\\\- \\*OC\\* x Scotty\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0Harry Potter\n\n\\\\- \\*OC\\* x OC\n\n\\\\- \\*OC\\* x Newt\n\n\\\\- Remus X \\*Sirius\\*\\\\\\*\n\n\\\\- \\*Queenie\\* X Jacob\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0Marvel\\\\\\*\\\\\\*\\\\\\*\n\n\\\\- \\*OC\\* x OC\n\n\\\\- \\*OC\\* x Hawkeye (Clint or Kate)\n\n\\\\- \\*Hawkeye (Kate)\\* x OC\n\n\\\\- \\*OC\\*\u00a0x Doctor Strange\n\n\\\\- \\*OC\\* x Bucky Barnes\n\n\\\\- \\*OC\\* x Charles Xavier\n\n\\\\- \\*OC\\* x Hank McCoy\n\n\\\\-\u00a0\\*Spider-Man\\* x Deadpool\n\n\\\\- \\*OC\\* x Daredevil (Comics)\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0DC\n\nMostly just looking for BatFam stories.\n\n\\*OC\\* x Jason Todd\n\n\ud83d\udcf7BBC\n\n\\\\-\u00a0 \\*OC\\* x Sherlock Holmes\n\n\\\\- \\*OC\\* x John Watson\n\n\\\\-\u00a0 \\*John Watson\\* x Sherlock Holmes\n\n\\\\-\u00a0 \\*OC\\* x Mycroft Holmes\n\n\\\\-\u00a0 \\*OC\\* x 10th Doctor\n\n\\\\-\u00a0 \\*OC\\*\u00a0x 11th Doctor\n\n\\\\-\u00a0 \\*OC\\* x OC Doctor\n\n\ud83d\udcf7Others\n\n\\\\- \\*Roxas\\* x Axel (KH)\n\n\\\\- \\*OC\\*\u00a0x Spencer (Criminal Minds)\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Story Ideas :\\*\\*\n\n(None of my ideas are too formed, to allow us to make it our own.)\n\n\ud83d\udcf7General Ideas That I'm Always Into\n\n\\\\-Modern Day AUs\n\n\\\\-Non-Modern AUs\n\n\\\\-Anything Cute Really\n\n\\\\-Canon-Divergent Stories that have basis in a Canon event\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0Star Wars\n\n\\\\-Matchmaker B.B.8 \\\\\\*\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 A story where our good pal beebee-ate accidentally acts as a matchmaker.

I am very open to suggestions, and love when we come up with everything together.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0Slow Build Romance. I love to build a relationship and watch it go through things, especially when there\u2019s drama!! (I love cheesy things like k-drama and fluffy fan fiction oops)\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0I like both fantasy and modern settings, as well as historical things when the story is right.\n\nSome Stories I Would Love\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0Something set in the 30's, 60's, 80's or 90's\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\u00a0Something where I got to play a medically complex character.

I\u2019m offering to play any type of character you want, to do your former plots that have fizzled out or been abandoned, to do that white whale of a story you\u2019ve been wanting to try for years, etc. That is, if they fit within my tastes which I will lay out along with a little bit of ooc information.\n\nI love fantasy of all type. High and low. Dark and Lighthearted. Medieval is by far my favorite (I\u2019m a D&amp;D nerd). Historical, modern, or any sort of original world are ok too. I like romance (slow burn especially), action, adventure, travel, slice of life, mentor/student (playing as either side), rivalries, monster hunting, vampires, intrigue, politics, arranged marriages, drama, and other things I\u2019ve probably forgotten about.\n\nI usually use discord, but can also do email or google docs if that doesn\u2019t work for you. I am over 21. I will only write in 3rd person. I post daily and write anywhere between 1-3 paragraphs. I can play multiple characters. I\u2019m a laid back partner who won\u2019t demand all your time.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to take me up on this offer, please tell me about your plot and/or character you want me to play. I can also make my own character if you have a plot, but don\u2019t care what sort of character fills it. Please let me know what you want and I will do my best to make it happen if I\u2019m interested. Thanks for reading!",

            "selftext": "Hey there! With class starting back up, I won't be having much time for a long term rp. So, I had an idea to do a short, depressing one-shot.\n\nBasic Premise: Four years into the Apocalypse, my character is bitten and spends her last hours alive with your character talking and reminiscing with each other.\n\nThis is obviously very dialogue heavy, so I am hoping for a partner that has the time to sit down for, say, an hour and rapid fire.\n\nAs for who you our characters are to each other, I have a few ideas. My character will always be female, you can choose whether yours is male or female:\n\nLovers - Could have been lovers from before or after \"the Fall\". \n\nSiblings - I can play older or younger sibling (or twins) in this scenario.\n\nParent/Child - I can play mother or daughter in this scenario. \n\nBest Friends - Grew up together. Maybe we grew apart in highschool/college and later found each other again after 'the Fall.'\n\nStrangers - I think strangers could be another interesting dynamic. You find me after I am bit and comfort me in my final hours.\n\nA Part of the Same Group/Friends - For this one, there could maybe be a sense of emergency. A run into town gone wrong and now we are locked inside a building. But we have to get medicine back to our group. \n\n\nWe will definitely expand on the scenario once we decide which one we are going with. Anyway, thanks for reading! Message me if you're interested.",

I\u2019m 21 and a college student working 3rd shift so I\u2019m pretty much up 24/7 so I\u2019ll be able to reply a ton once we get going. I typically use 3rd person so I\u2019m better at that then 1st. In terms of types of role plays I do I\u2019m a huge fan of Romance and Slice of Life. I\u2019m always willing to do those stories but if you got some ideas you wanna try I\u2019m all ears to listen to them. I don\u2019t mind playing Male or Female characters and don\u2019t really have a preference. \nI\u2019m not very picky about who I partner with other than the kinda basic stuff, ya know be respectful and no crazy messed up things all kinda common knowledge. I\u2019m okay with darker themes and more complex plots as long as they make sense enough that we both can understand it and have characters build off it. \nI\u2019m also trying to improve. I welcome all types of writers from beginners to experts, if you\u2019re nervous about your writing don\u2019t be. I\u2019m trying to improve as much as you are and I\u2019m always willing to take constructive criticism and advice as-well as giving it if I can. \nThat\u2019s really all I got so if you\u2019re interested or have any questions you wanna know just DM me and I\u2019ll gladly get back to you!

For instance, in MHA UA will be changed to a university and for Naruto, the Academy goes from 12-18 so all graduates put into teams will be 18. And in Star vs The Forces of Evil, our RP won't begin until Star and Marco are adults, entering community college. Or that the school Star visited in the first season, was already community college. Those are just some examples but the rest of the fandoms will be adjusted similarly.\n\nI can play either gender but prefer writing against male writers. I am in my early 30a and want someone is also at least in their 20s. Just for the sake of us having similar outside expectations and obligations. I post when I can and don't hassle folks to reply unless it's been over a week. I am currently going back to school so my time varies. That said, I am active in OOC if you are. \n\nGenerally I write via discord and give about 1-2 posts (per its character limit), depending on the scene (aka about 4-5 paragraphs). I love slice of life and romance, action is not my strong suit but I am eager to improve in that area as well. Something slow burn is ideal. I'm not looking to inject too much drama into my stories however, life is stressful enough.\n\nAnything else, we can figure out via PM. If you're curious about something not listed or something celeb based, still reach out. Also crossovers can be super fun too. I'm pretty open-minded!",

I posted the other day and didn\u2019t really click with anyone! Just lost my job, so I have a good bit of free time while I hunt for a new one! I don't have any particular ideas, right now. If you do, I\u2019d love to hear them! I love a good fantasy setting, historical setting, sci-fi, but I'm open to collaborating. Having a craving for something dark, maybe with vampires, or werewolves, demons, dragons, merfolk. or magic. You get the gist, I like mythical beings. If that\u2019s not your cup of tea, please still message me! \n\nI\u2019m just usually NOT into Slice of Life, modern settings, or Fandoms.\n\nA little about me. I'm 27 (so please be around my age. I can't be doing this with an 18 year old, sorry, be at least close to my age?) I've been role-playing on and off since I was about 14, so this isn't anything new. I currently have one role play partner on discord, which I've been writing with since the beginning. The stories are always fun, but they're not testing my writing abilities anymore. I'm on EST. Reply length doesn't really matter to me, the longer the better, of course, but it's quality over quantity. I don't really have any limits when it comes to quantity. I typically play female character, but I'm open to playing both, and am willing to play multiple characters as needed.\n\nAs I said, I don't have any specific ideas in mind, I'd love to hear anything! I can also work with you to come up with an idea, if you have none and I like our vibe. Oh! Also, I don't want this to be just business. I'd like to also make a new friend, and occasionally have conversations outside the story. If that's cool with you?\n\nWell, I think that's everything! If you're still here, and are still interested, please shoot me a message, maybe start off with a joke! Give me a bit about you? I look forward to meeting you!",

            "selftext": "hello, thank you very much for taking an interest in my post today!\n\ni\u2019m looking for some literate partners for some fandoms today, my fandoms are limited rn since i'm only craving one in particular, but i hope to find someone interested in it!\n\nplease be sure to read all of my rules and not skim over them, i just want to make sure we\u2019ll get along well. without further ado, let\u2019s get into it!\n\n\ud835\udc20\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1d \ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc31\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2c.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \uff65 \uff61\uff9f\u2606: \\*.\u263d .\\* :\u2606\uff9f. \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\n\u2799 Please be above the age of 18, I don\u2019t want to roleplay with minors. Nothing against them! It\u2019s just for my personal comfort. \u2665\n\n***\u2799 I only double! OCxCanon where we play a canon character for each other and our OCs. If this doesn't interest you, please don't reach out to me!***\n\n\u2799 I consider myself lit. / adv lit! I can write quite a bit when I\u2019m feeling inspired and while I don\u2019t expect you to match, I do expect you to put your best foot forward though, as will I!\n\n\u2799 Your grammar and spelling don\u2019t have to be perfect. This goes hand in hand with the rule above - just try your best and I\u2019ll be happy. \\^\\^\n\n\u2799 Please write in the third person, 1st person is hard for me to immerse myself in. Past or present tense is fine with me, but I usually stick with past tense!\n\n\u2799 Real-life comes first, take breaks when you need to, don't feel pressured to respond every day, and take your time. Roleplay is a hobby, not a job! Plus, I have... lots n' lots of patience. If you disappear for months, I guarantee if you come back and ask to start up again I'd likely say yes.\n\nHowever, do please keep me updated! Even if it's a simple 'I'm doing okay' I'd like to know that everything is alright! While we're on that topic, please talk to me OOC as well! I love headcanons and rambling about the roleplay as we write. Plus, who doesn't love making new friends?\n\n\u2799 I\u2019m willing to play any canon character for you in return for you writing one for me, I might stumble at first, but I will try my best. Please be willing to do the same. It\u2019s okay if you\u2019re not perfect, I\u2019m not expecting you to be, but be willing to leave your comfort zone! On that note, if we share the same interest, I\u2019m okay with splitting, doing an AU on my end, or switching.\n\n\u2799 I only roleplay on Discord or through email.\n\n\u2799 I am ghost friendly, no hard feelings! I don't try to ghost anyone unless I'm very uncomfortable, but I understand when people need/want to just dip out without a goodbye. Goodbyes can be awkward!\n\n\u2799 Romance is cool, fun, and funky fresh (that\u2019s the whole point of doubling lol) but I want a plot too! Please, throw me your plot ideas, AUs, and whatever else! Mystery, drama, action, adventure, horror, angst, throw everything you have at me - I would love to plot with you!! That being said, communication is key, please give me more input than 'sounds good/okay/im fine with that'!\n\nthat\u2019s it - i\u2019m really not that picky! i like to think i\u2019m very open to most things people can throw at me, but as long as you can follow those basic guidelines, please message me!! i don\u2019t bite! C: and of course, as above, so below - all of these rules apply to me just as much as they do to you.\n\nfandoms - i only ***double. i do not do ocxoc.***\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \uff65 \uff61\uff9f\u2606: \\*.\u263d .\\* :\u2606\uff9f. \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\n\u21dd Jojo's Bizarre Adventure\n\nI am caught up with the manga &amp; anime, lean towards part 7 currently!\n\n\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d'\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc25 \ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc24\ud835\udc2c!\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \uff65 \uff61\uff9f\u2606: \\*.\u263d .\\* :\u2606\uff9f. \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\ni hope to get a few messages, but if not, thank you for taking the time out of your day to read this! i appreciate the interest and i hope you have a good rest of your day/night. \u2665",

            "selftext": "Hi everyone. I\u2019m looking for a Roleplay partner, as the title states. I\u2019m alright with doing both MxF and MxM. My plan for this roleplay is to do a quite long-term slice of life roleplay. Probably starting in our early twenties, and ending quite far off. I\u2019d like to explore the major events someone has in their life, I.e. marriage, children, career events. That said, if you\u2019re a guy, feel free to message me.\n\nHere\u2019s the prompt idea, before you get bored of reading my wall of text; I\u2019d prefer to start somewhere in college, or online dating, or a mix of the two. I like to have some conflict in the story, perhaps some conflicting trait or background, such as a different political view or religion, or one of us being from another income bracket or race. \n\nGenerally, my character is a tall, confident guy, who studies for a well paying career in finance or as a lawyer. If the scenario happens on which my character isn\u2019t one of high class or income, I like to play as someone who\u2019s strong, and a laborer; such as a mechanic or construction site worker.\n\nI like to write in first person, but I\u2019m also fine with doing third, if that\u2019s what you\u2019d prefer. I can roleplay on Reddit and discord, so just let me know what you prefer to use.",

To others, they are a symbol of good and Justice.\n\nMy name is Xwing, aged 19, and I am looking for a Semi-Lit to Literate individual to participate in a GM directed rp by yours truly, the theme will be slice of life, but due to the custom nature of this rp, there will be other themes and genres mixed in decided by the user.(Hence the NSFW tag) As you would expect, I'll be playing many NPC's character and be running the scenarios. As GM, it is my job to provide you as the player, the details and situation needed to make choices and progress the story.\n\nSo here is the basic premise regardless of added factors.\n\n&gt;Throughout your life, you have been known to have a degree of luck others would be envious of. Through one means or another, an accident, something more purposeful, your luck ran out and you were left in an unfortunate state... \nYet, you survived, and now you see a person beside you on your Hospital bed, a person only you can see. They explain they are an angel, and they just saved you from death, as a consequence, they don't have access to the heavens above any more and are now relegated to being your imaginary friend of sorts.\nWith a heavenly friend by your side, it is up to you to decide how to use this second chance you have been given, for better or worse... Pick up the pieces, should there be any to collect. And live your new life with.. Well, an Angel by Your Side.\n\n\nNow, few things.\n- This will be on Discord, we can use reddit chat to meet up and exchange Discord tags, but thats pretty much it, everything else will be discussed and done on Discord\n\n- 18+ Preferred. Death itself is a grim topic... And depending on what you choose, other dark subject matter can be brought into play... I prefer that the player is 18+ and has an open mind.\n\n- Regular replies encouraged. Life comes up, so I understand if you need to step away when you need or are just busy with things. But I would to see replies often, helps with engagement.\n\n- Co-operation welcomed. This is a story you are making, I am merely setting the stage. You gotta fill it with an actor who can carry the story as well, I can't do this without you as the player.\n\n\n\nWith all that out of the way, and you have made it this far and are still interested, then feel free to DM me and we can take it from there. I Hope to talk you soon.",

            "selftext": "Hey all. I have a few ideas for a roleplay I want to do. All are slow burn Romance but some have other aspects more than others. I would be the female role but I'm happy to double.\n\n1. 1800's london,  our characters are about to visit the castle for the social season on of the city, where all the young women and men go to find a proper spouse. Our characters don't get along very well from old family drama. But something draws them together a devious plot or a secret love. Up to us\n\n2.  1700's scotland or london. Probably the countryside  my character will be the daughter of a rival clan, or crown. Who gets seperated from her traveling party during a raid attack for royal money. (Or something else). She gets lost, almost attack your character and band of men save her and thinking she may be a spy or may be useful take her back with you, and our characters form an attachment of some sort maybe it's to save her her life or his or try to bring the rivals together, but they aren't into each other at first. \n\n3. Arranged marriage. Boom most detailed lol.\n\nHope you guys like any of these. Being your own if they spark anything. I'm willing to make changes.  please be 18+ as I am and there could be violence gore and cursing among other things",

For nearly three decades, we've been pushed back into a corner. Children are being born knowing nothing but war. Others are being snuffed out just the same.\n\nBut a few, lucky to some, cursed to others, have been taken from dead worlds and given the option to take revenge for those they've lost. Swept away from planets disappearing under plasma bombardments, they were trained to be soldiers.\n\nAnd they were disposable. Trading lives for time.\n\nBut others were different. Spirited away even from their new brothers and sisters, paired up, and sent on clandestine missions that make them little more than ghosts, grinning skulls in the darkness of whatever planet they're sent to. A single crack of a rifle, the hiss of a knife against a scabbard as it's put back, its work done, the icy feeling of cryosleep as they await their next mission.\n\nHeadhunters.\n\nNow it's your turn, the chance to get the revenge you've wanted since you were a child, and no matter how many times you go through the motions and wipe another Covenant VIP or position off the face of the galaxy forever, it's never quenched.\n\nTake on the mantle of a Headhunter and become one of those skulls, a Reaper let loose upon the alien menace, to repay them for their crusade a dozen times over.",

Its coliseum is famous for hosting fights against creatures of all kinds. The magical creature had managed to escape during its battle, an arrow caught in its leg. They make their way into a sparse and poor part of the city where eventually they collapse. This is where you step in, finding the creature and bringing them in to treat their wound. Thus, creating an unlikely pair that will travel alongside each other to bring the creature back to its home. \n\nI have a few rules before we start. \n\u2022 Must be 18+, I am an adult \n\u2022 Play as multiple roles \n\u2022 Add on to the story\n\u2022 Role-play in third person\n\u2022 Must have Telegram\u00a0 \n\nReplies will be slow, so please be patient. You don't have to worry about writing many paragraphs, one paragraph will be good enough. I'm striving to have fun! I need someone to play as the person who finds the magical creature and is preferably male, it doesn't matter what gender you actually are. I will be playing as the creature. My character has no gender although they are a tad feminine. They are a magical being. \n\nI want this role-play to have lots of fluff and dark moments. There will be no romance. \n\nI hope this interests you! Looking forwards to any who messages!",

Thank you so much for your interest and overwhelmingly positive response.   \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHey, thanks for taking the time to read this post. I wrote out a character with a pretty tragic (but clich\u00e9) backstory, and, like the title says, I'm looking to write him. I only write on Discord, and I'm seeking people who write third person past tense. While I don't like to set post limits, I like to have something I can work with. As for the setting? Anything would work.\n\nTo let you know about myself, I am a college student who tends to be pretty busy, but I was just quarantined due to the virus and see myself having some extra time for a week or so. If we really hit it off, we could be writing for months. I live in the EST and tend to be moving from 7 AM to 10 PM give or take an hour. I like idle chatting with my partner, but if you want this partnership to be strictly business that's okay too!\n\nAs for the character: he's an older widower who has not been the same since his (pregnant) wife passed. The specifics of the death, his age, and his backstory would vary based on the setting we pick, but the basics of it is a sad, middle-aged man who finds something to make life worth living again.\n\nIf you're interested in that, please send me a message or pm, I'm not too picky on that end.",

            "selftext": "Greetings. A little information about me as a person. I grew up in Detroit, loved writing growing up, have done plenty of rps before (though only recently came to Reddit for rping), and I've always been open to just about anything. Be it fantasy or realistic I'll do it. This time however I have a plot very close to my heart. A little context. Growing up in Detroit I wasn't exactly rich. This made holidays like Halloween a little difficult to have a lot of fun in. One Halloween year me and the family were pretty much entirely out of money... But I still wanted to dress up as Halloween is my favorite Holiday. So I did what probably is the start to many cosplay accounts and I dug through what I had to see if I could make a costume from it. And sure enough I did. Digging through the boxes we had I found a newsboys hat, a leather jacket, an eye patch weirdly, and... A V for Vendetta mask. With this I created a character. Clad in dark blue jeans, wool gloves, a black leather jacket, the newsboy hat, a V's mask and an eye patch over the right eyesocket, this character (considering it was me) had longer hair streaking out the front from under the hat and covering a portion of the forehead. My friends asked me who he was... My response? Well if you look at my user name you'll see. He was the Digital Pirate. The character never left my mind. Since then I've always wanted to find a way to bring Digital Pirate to life. I don't have the drawing skills and frankly I'm not a fan of writing on fanfiction or Wattpad lol. Then I realized... Perhaps the best place for Digital Pirate is through RP. If you're willing to help me bring the story of a childhood hero to life please PM. I will have sets of questions for you, nothing personal, to make sure you're a good fit for the type of story I want to tell Digital Pirate. Thank you for your time and consideration. Please have a great day everyone!",

Either way, I'm looking for someone to do a roleplay within a fantasy world along with me, I'll act as some sort of DM, though you're still very much welcomed to add your own character and further the story and plot however you wish (Just because I'll be playing my own character and DM'ing the rp doesn't mean you can't either).\n\nRomance is optional, but I've already prepared the plot and world itself for us, regardless of what your character is like.\n\nJust a few last words now, sorry for whoever read this far, I know this is an awful ad, but I'm welcoming anyone! I do plan to move to Discord if we do actually roleplay, though I'm not against using Reddit's dm feature. And as the title implies, expect a lot of fighting.",

            "selftext": "Hello! I've done a few, but it never seems like a good Percy Jackson role gets boring. I'm currently looking for a partner with which to one such role. \n\nSpecifically, I have the skeleton of a plot that I have been ruminating over for some time. Basically, I would be a homeless guy on the street who was a demigod but I never knew. You would be a camper from camp half blood who has been tracking a monster and who happens to show up where I do and attack me. You help me Get back to camp but when I eventually get claimed it turns out that I'm not a Greek demigod, but Roman. Also, at the same time Poseidon's trident gets stolen and I am blamed for it due to my parentage (The specifics of which will be revealed). I then go on a quest with you and another character to retrieve it. A lot of the conflict would come from the fact that I'm a Roman demigod and it would turn out this quest is just a cog in a machine of a larger plot. We can tweak details as necessary, But I would like to at least have the skeleton of a plot.\n\nI would prefer if my partner has a decent knowledge of the Percy Jackson series and the Heroes of Olympus. I would prefer a detailed partner who isn't afraid to advance the story a little themselves. I usually write one to two paragraphs, but I'm not mad at all with a shorter response as long as that's not the default.\n\nPlease message me if you are interested!",

            "selftext": "\n\nHowdy, I got some ideas i\u2019d like to share. If you\u2019re interested in one or more of these, let me know. I\u2019m also more than open to suggestions, so feel free to pitch any of your ideas to me!\n\n===========================\n\n-Call me JD. 23, on EST. I\u2019d prefer my partner be over 20 years old.\n\n-I can rp both genders, but I usually have my main character be a female.  I generally only do hetero pairings.\n\n-I typically write anywhere from 3-5 paragraphs. I\u2019d ask my partner do their best to match.\n\n-I can typically get a couple of responses in a day, and i\u2019d ask that my partner does the same.  \n\n-I\u2019d like the main plot to be the central aspect, with a romance subplot aswell! We can discuss this further once we get to talking.\n\n=============================\n\n-Our characters, one a detective and one a crime lord, end up having to settle their differences in lieu of a threat bigger than the both of them.  It would follow our characters attempting to keep their connection with eachother discreet, while also battling some sort of fantastical entity.  This one would prolly have the most worldbuilding of the bunch, with our characters exploring both a fictional city and an entire new world.\n\n-A pure crime drama, following two low-level goons who\u2019re wronged by a higher up from their own gang.  This would probably be the most grounded in reality, following our characters attempting to regain whatever they lost, along with earning a cathartic release to the person that ruined their lives.\n\n-Two people who end up in a boatload of trouble after following a mysterious phone call. Think hotline miami, but with more travel and a duo instead of two intertwining stories! I feel this would go better with younger characters, though I\u2019m open to ideas!",

I\u2019m not super far in but I already know about most of what happens from fanfiction, fanart, and google, so I\u2019m open to roleplaying based on either or both.\n\nCurrently looking to rp as Kageyama in any of these pairings:\nTsukishima/ Kageyama \nOikawa / Kageyama \nAtsumu / Kageyama \n\n(If none of these are appealing to you and you have another Kageyama/Someone ship in mind, let me know!)\n\nI\u2019m cool with doubling if you\u2019re interested in that too! (I only write f/f or m/m pairings though, and only canon characters) I\u2019m not looking for anything super specific plot wise, I like doing soulmate AUs and canon divergence AUs, but honestly I\u2019m open to pretty much anything.\n\nI write in 3rd person, can match you at whatever length you\u2019re comfortable with, and can usually respond at least once a day. Also, I\u2019m 21, and prefer to only rp with people that are at least 18. I mostly rp on discord, but if you\u2019d prefer another platform just let me know! DM me or comment below so I can DM you if you\u2019re interested! Thank you!",

            "selftext": "Please read all!\n\n\n\nHello, I am currently looking for a long-term partner to Role Play with as I have two plots I would very much like to play!\n\n\nI have multiple plots we can use! I am advance literate and I tend to write a lot. (So forgive me if I do) I am very descriptive when writing as well. So please do so as well. It's easier to read. And we both have a better understanding of our Role play. \nI ask for you to At least be 18 years or older, I'm 18 myself and I feel more comfortable role-playing with someone my age. I also ask if OOC is an other thing I would like to have, it better helps us get to know what we want and enjoy in roleplaying as well as getting to know eachother a bit more. \n\n\nMy characters are all of different races. So please. Do not throw any racial slurs towards me. That's something I do not want to hear. Believe me I ran into people who really dislike characters or color or other ethnicity.\u00a0\n\n\n\nNow to the plot!\n\n\nI do Sci-Fi, Horror, Adventure, Fantasy, all! I like a wide range of genres. I am a very creative person. And I love making new storylines and plots. (I don't exactly do heavy fantasy)\n\n\nI do Character x Character(OC x OC--)Romance and all. No matter the gender.\u00a0\nI don't do Canon x Canon, as role-playing for fandoms is not what I am looking for at this time. \n\n\nNow. Really. To the plots.\u00a0\n\nI don't want to put too many. But here is just enough info to get you a little aware of what I'm looking for etc. Yes. These plots are creative, fun to be in. I decided to make them interesting so people can all have fun with them.\nBoth plots can be story driven and romanced, your OC will be the protagonist of the story. \n\n\nPlot 1:\n\nThis one is actually a bit different. Roswell being a character I use for many alien invasion plots. To tell you about him before I get to the plot.\u00a0\n\nHe's a hot headed, short temper alien who was kicked down to earth by his kind because he always made mistakes and was lacking certain ablites that is kind had, deeming him as useless and unable to carry on a new generation, Roswell was kicked down to earth, which--if some of you may know, who was deemed as the Roswell alien in Roswell, New Mexico. \nLost, alone, perplexed and betrayed. Roswell is stuck on earth. With little to no knowledge on who inhabits that planet. That's until he meets you. (Your character/oc) who takes Roswell under their wing because they know no other human will. Knowing the fact if any other person were to find Roswell, it would result in them maybe killing him or--\nSend him to the world's most notorious facilities. Area 51.\n\nUnknowingly a dark entity seeks out vengace to cause genocide to Earth, an entity that understands the lost wayward souls that met the fate of each extraterritorials that so happened to land on earth. Though I can't tell you the motives of why this being is out for vengeance, it is up to your (character/of) and Roswell as well as the helo of other characters along the way, to save mankind. \n\nThat's all I'm giving for that plot. But a few key factors is that this will be; An adventure based RP, romance is optional (it helps enhance the story), whatever choices you make will affect the story so it is up to you to make sure you save planet earth!\u00a0\n\n\nQuotes from Roswell\n\n\"What makes you think I care for you or this putrid planet?! I was kicked from my home! I could care less about this--this...this fleshy world filled with creatures that argue over everything!\"\n\n\n\"I don't have television where I reside. But it is nice seeing this contraption display motion pictures.\"\n\n\n\"I'm smarter than I look, I built a machine only using scrap metal. And a bone from a dog I found laying around in the streets. And don't tell me why. Because I will not answer it.\"\n\n\"So. Just because I'm an..an...alien. You can't see me as a real person?\"\n\n\"Why can't I ever go outside with you! I want to see the world too!\"\n\n\"You're naming me. Roswell..? What kind of silly name is that?! Though...well. I have heard some...unfortunate names.\"\n\n\n\n\nThe next plot. And the last plot I will be giving. (Don't wanna share too much)\u00a0\n\nIs about your character. Who discovers they have quirks. Or an epithet. A power a human is able to wield. It is odd to see one in society as humans only had quirks way back in history! And by the spirits from the past grants you your own butler? Helper? Spiritual- being -helper? Meet Boo. (My character)\n\nBoo is your own personal assistant that will help guide you throughout your journey to find your true power and why it was passed down to you! But beware. An evil entity is out to corrupt you. Or...kill you. In order to restore the evil spirits back to earth. To claim the earth as his.\u00a0\n\nYou find out in the past that the world was integrated with humans and a spiritual/monster species. Called. 'The Guardians' were a species of monsters that roamed the earth just like humans. Some humans didn't like them. Thinking they were savages and might one day cause harm to humans. Until one day. They did. Humans banished The Guardians from earth and now it is up to you to save earth. And bring back the Guardians with Boo's help to bring everyone to Justice and restore order and peace. Along the way will you meet anyone like yourself that also has an epithet?\n\n\nBoo's gender varies. (You can pick)\n\nBoo's personality is very witty. Always holding a large grin on their face. As a guide. Boo has to have the utmost respect towards (your character) no matter what they tell them to do. Boo listens and does it.\u00a0Boo's one main objective is to help along the way with (your character/oc) and help them guide the world to Justice.\nAt times Boo is very aggressive and loud mouth. Make sure that society doesn't know a guardian is on earth! Or else things will get out of hand. The choices you make in this story will affect the plot. (Not drastically)\n\n\n'Quotes from Boo to get a better understanding of them'\n\n\n\"All it takes is one word. And I'll rip his head clean off his neck.\"\n\n\n\"You're afraid of me..aren't you?\"\n\n\n\"Hm. Ravishing.

            "selftext": "So I posted recently and I was surprised to have gotten a couple of messages but sadly I didn't find a lasting partner. I did, however, learn more about what I want out of an RP so without further delay, I shall share my basic idea of a fantasy RP.\n\nIn my head I see a world with kingdoms and monsters, adventurers and heroes. I see two characters that end up traveling together across the land picking up jobs and helping people in need. Coming across forgotten cities that contain lost technology, hidden ruins guarded by ancient creations and tranquil oasis tucked away behind waterfalls. Traveling the rolling hills of the countryside by wagon. Emptying the sand from their boots after trekking through the massive sand dunes of the desert. Seeking shelter to avoid the freezing winds of the mountain ranges increased elevation. I'm sure we can mix in the sea and sky in some way.\n\nAs far as a story is concerned...I would like to discuss this more buuuuut if I did have anything to share in this post it would be this and hopefully I explain it well enough. I want our characters to be the side characters to a greater story. A heroic group, that we will not control, travels the land trying to vanquish a great evil. In the meantime our characters will be busy with their own personal quest that has no substantial effect on the world. Preferably I would like your character to be the lead in this story while my character would take on a supportive role. I wouldn't mind playing other characters either. Example, our characters form a party or a reoccurring character like a tavern owner or minor like some night shift gate guards.\n\nOne last thing I want to include with this fantasy RP! I would like to include some aspect of flying. More floating islands that high level adventurers can travel to by means of some device or tool. Like a board, broom, bike...whatever. This actually looks goofy now that I read it back but I stand by it.\n\nIf interested then just know I plan on this being a long term commitment. We can discuss more but if you decide it isn't for you then feel free to tell me at anytime. I wouldn't be wounded because of it. I am an adult and I just do this for fun! I enjoy it.\n\nI'll be taking inspiration from different sources of media. Games, movies and tv, books. MMO's will be the greatest source. The DnD series, The ashes of Valkana: Titans Grave. Stuff like that. I do want to keep this casual though. Nice long replies with short ones mixed in. I do work a full time job but if we stay consistent then I will be able to reply daily. I do have a few hobbies that keep me busy sometimes.\n\nI think overall I have said what I wanted to say. I'm sure there are a few bits of info I forgot or overlooked so if you have any questions for me, feel free to ask. Reach out by DM or Chat. Doesn't matter to me. I hope I expressed myself well enough to grab your attention! I know this is just a wall of text but did I tried to keep some form of... order?",

            "selftext": "Hello there, I\u2019m wondering if anyone would like to do a roleplay with me.\n\nTo get the boring bits over with here are a list of things to know\n\n1. I prefer to roleplay in description form, and I would prefer if you are able to write a good paragraph\n2. I play with an oc. You do not need to have an oc yourself if you don\u2019t have one\n3. Whether you are playing an oc or a canon character, please be able to play more than one character. For me, it helps with the story flow, and I would strongly prefer if I wasn\u2019t the one playing all the characters.\n4. There can be doubling if you want to. This is mainly for if you want our characters to have completely separate stories (like if our characters are in teams that are rivals), or for whatever other reason\n5. If there will be romance involved, I will have to ask that my character doesn\u2019t have a romantic plot, and have a platonic plot instead. You can have a romantic plot, but I prefer not to for myself. If you are playing \tas a canon character, I do have certain ships that I like to play \tand will give them to you if you want\n6. I would really prefer if you have a really good idea as to how the canon characters act in general. It just feels really off for me when the canon character is all of a sudden acting out of character\n7. I will message you once every 24 hours if you have yet to reply, and I will allow you the same. Please for the love of god, do not message me 15 minutes of not replying. If there is something going on in your \tlife, I will wait longer before messaging you, 3 days minimum, 1 week maximum. I will try three times, and if you don\u2019t reply at \tall, then I will leave you alone\n8. When it comes to storylines, I would rather go along with the story, but we don\u2019t have to go strictly by the story. If there\u2019s anything we want to change about the story (such as how a certain scene went, etc), we can do that. Though, I am alright with slipping in a small prompt \t(like a \u2018secret admirer\u2019 story)",

Reading through some of the other posts on here makes the individuals running the role play a little intimidating.. With all of their rules and guidelines, ONLY 1st person or 3rd.. I dont know its alot to take in I guess.\nBut if anyone wants to help me dive into this experience, and has plenty of patience and is willing to explain the rules to me I would really appreciate it. I do have discord if thats necessary, im over 18, id like to do something with romance, maybe psychological stuff to make it a bit dark? Idk.. But let me know!",

They didn\u2019t have to be literate, and I don\u2019t care about their age as long as they are old enough for discord and Reddit (obviously). I don\u2019t want to do NSFW or 18+, or any sort of gore, or graphic bloody stuff. (I\u2019m very sensitive to horror stuff so maybe not talk about that!). You can do paragraphs or sentences, take your time to respond also!! What would we do? Well, that\u2019s up to us! Dm me and we can talk about it! I usually go for a school/town kinda setting, but I think any type of setting could work. Examples:\n\nSpace Station\n\nCircus/carnival\n\nTown\n\nSchool (different types)\n\nForest\n\nFuture\n\nDifferent types of scenarios\n\nMy one of my many OCs \n\nHer name is NIkku Aya, and she has a father who is very mean towards her. Her mother died at her birth. Nikku had an older brother named Max and she also has a stepmother named Kora with a daughter named Mina. She has black hair with a fade of white at the end and black eyes.\n\nI\u2019m trying to recreate her, since my last RP she had been shown as a bad OC, but I think she is good to be used again!!! (if you had any advice about what I should add or take away from Nikku, please enlighten me!!) \n\nWhat I don\u2019t want with the rp:\n\nToo much graphic stuff\n\nNo NSFW aka 18+\n\nAnti-Religious things\n\nToo many Horror-esc things (again, I can easily get terrified so please not too many graphic things with the horror aspect)\n\nNo rudeness towards me when OOC\n\nNo toxicity towards me OOC\n\nWhat I do want in the rp:\n\nLong-lasting friendship, hopefully, especially OOC\n\nGreat character growth\n\nFun\n\nContact:\n\nReddit, Twitter, Discord\n\nThat\u2019s about it.",

If this is something that you think you'd like to do DM me or comment on the post and I'll get back to you!\n\nI'm also 26 so I prefer to RP with people around my age group.

            "selftext": "*It had been years since Tom and Star Butterfly broke up. The prince spent a lot of time by his lonesome ever since his two friends became a couple. He was now 22 and still wasn\u2019t interested in dating, dismaying his parents to no end. Sure, people admired him, but he just didn\u2019t feel the spark of his first love.*\n\n*That all changed when he saw... him? And his entire worldview shifted. The fireworks he once felt for Star emerged in this new face. What will transpire between the demon prince and this mysterious newcomer?*\n\nHi there everyone! This is an idea I\u2019ve been thinking about for awhile! I am hoping to find someone to play as my favorite demon man, Tom for an older, college-age SVTFOE roleplay! After years of being on his own, he finally finds someone that makes him feel special: a new friend to the gang at their college. Could this new guy be just the person to spend his life with?\n\nThis concept is rough, but I wanted to expand upon it together and tailor it to our liking! I am also happy to discuss splitting up characters together to lighten the load! \n\n~Rules~\n\n1. Please be a literate, 3rd person player. You do not need to write a novel, however sentence/paragraph structure are a huge must for me. No text talk or improper punctuation.\n2. Please be active overall. I understand we have lives, however, if you are the type to disappear/ghost, I am not for you. I want us to keep a steady stream going so things do not get stale! If you do need to leave, please just communicate.\n3. Because the characters are all going to be 21+ here, I am asking that you also be 21+. \n4. Because this is an MxM romantic pairing, you should of course be okay with LGBTQ+ characters and relationships. Messaging asking for MxF will be ignored. \n5. If you have a writing sample, you will be given priority. While not a requirement, however, I would just like to see if we are a solid fit before wasting either of our times. This can be from any roleplay, and does not necessarily need to be SVTFOE. \n\nIf interested, feel free to PM me! Thank you so much for reading and have a wonderful day!",

This could be set after or before his games, or the quarter-quells. \n(I\u2019d also be down for peeta x katniss)\nI\u2019m lit-adv lit, and ask my partner to be the same. I can play either, but below is a starter, so you can have an idea of my style. \nI\u2019d prefer to use discord, but feel free to message me here first so we can discuss things! Thank you for reading!!\n              \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFinnick hated Reapings more than he hated the prancing and preening that came after it. Convincing tribute after tribute that they would make it, to never lose hope, and getting his heart crushed when\u2019s forced to see them die, surrounded  by people who cheered and clapped. Some even made games about it all. And he hated that he had to indulge those capital idiots - in every way possible. \n\nHe didn\u2019t want to lose Annie, but after his games, he felt ashamed. He was nothing more than a pretty smile and body, ever since they could use him, they did. And he hated that. And they had threats. He distanced himself to try prevent Annie from being a pawn used against him. But as soon as her name was called, he felt sickening wrong. \n\nHe didn\u2019t let that show. He just sat there and smiled whilst Bash made little effort to hide his joy at picking another victim out to die. Another two. He noticed how Annie avoided looking at him, and he wondered just what she thought of him, if she did at all. He wouldn\u2019t surprised if she hated him. He would if the tables were turned. \n\nBefore he knew it, he was back on the train, nursing a drink of whiskey as he waited for his tributes to show up. And once they had, he used it as liquid courage to speak to Annie. He sat down opposite her, placing an equally full glass down opposite his own. A peace offering. \n\nHe wasn\u2019t sure what to say, leaning forward with his forearms resting on his thighs.

I'm looking for someone around my age (17-21) please.\n\nI have multiple prompts, and I'm hoping to have a bit of romance in each. I would prefer OCxCanon where I control a Canon character of your choice and My character, and you do vice versa for me. I am looking for a Semi-Literate to Literate RPer who Roleplays in 3rd person, HOWEVER we can discuss if you wish to RP in first person.  I typically use Discord as a platform for RP, as I am more active and faster to reply there.  \n\n\nPROMPTS (We can discuss something outside of these prompts or even a modification)\n\n* Two new up and coming hero's graduating from UA and Shiketsu High are immediate rivals. On the verge of breaking down, one falls in line with the Villain league and actively seeks to destroy the still hero. \n* By day, they're a student. By night, they're an Arcade legend. Another, less talented student takes note of this talented legend, seeking them out for guidance and advice. The legendary student agrees to mentor the less talented student and together, they work to build confidence and general ability in the two's favorite game: Dance Dance revolution.\n* Child hood friends to sworn enemies, a fight in their middle school years tore them apart for the good. One constantly bad mouths the other, while the other simply keeps they're mouth shut and respects the distance put between the two. Little do they know that they'd soon have to rely on each other more and more as the teachers begin to partner the two up for team matches and general work studies within school.\n* \\[Fantasy AU\\] (Taken from a Previous Post)  A strong and Nobel guard (Y/C) has been hand selected out of thousands to be the newly appointed prince's (M/C) guard. However, the guard is quite shocked and frustrated to learn the prince avoids him at every cost: Sneaking out of the castle, partaking in activities a Nobel shouldn't, and causing general disarray within the castle. One day as his guard is searching for him, he finds the princes has been taken by a neighboring kingdom that wants more territory, the two kingdoms now on the brink of war. **Note for this one:** I would very much prefer to be the prince in this story! However we can discuss things in dms.\n\nWarning: If you RP in one liners and in first person, I will stop RPing with you.",

            "selftext": "Hey everyone out there! I recently just finished the show Gravity Falls. I know, I'm like five years late but it was AMAZING! So, naturally, I am craving working on a story for this universe! But **I also am looking for new partners for original stories as well!**\n\n*To start, I'll talk about me and my RP style:*\n\n* I'm a 21 year old female\n* You can call me Lils or Talia!\n* I write in third person, past tense\n* I am more of a rapid-replier, therefore I enjoy shorter replies. Anywhere from a few sentences to a few paragraphs, but definitely not whole novella style, sorry! Quality &gt; quantity.\n* I love writing for FUN! It's a huge hobby of mine, but not my whole life. If the roleplay isn't proving to be fun, then what are we doing with ourselves? Let's spice it up and have a good time w/ this!\n* I mostly have experience writing original characters and storylines, but have been looking to branch out!\n* As far as coupling, these are my preferences in order: MxM, MxF, FxF\n\n*Who I'm Looking For:*\n\n* Someone who enjoys OOC chatter as much as I do!! I've met my best friend in the world through online RPing and I'm always open to more friendships!\n* Someone 18+\n* Someone willing to RP on email or google docs, and use Discord for chatting!\n* I prefer writing with other females, but am willing to hear out others!\n* Someone who doesn't just say \"hey wanna rp\" LMAO like sorry, not responding :\\^)\n* Someone who is ready to talk shop and worldbuild and have fun with this!\n\n*Gravity Falls*\n\nSo I have this one story idea for the Gravity Falls universe. I'm going to give a rough rundown, but I'm ABSOLUTELY open to any ideas thrown my way or creating something new!\u00a0\n\nHere's my rough idea though:\n\nIt's been a decade since Dipper or Mabel have returned to Gravity Falls. Now, at 27 years old, they have accepted the assumed death of the grunkles, who went missing a few years ago. Dipper published a book about his adventures in Oregon, but became a laughing stock of the science community, and fell back to a corny (and failing) ghost hunting show. Mabel owns her own fashion company and has a successful, creative life. However, everything changes the day that Soos's son finds a walkie-talkie in The Mystery Shack and unlocks a groundbreaking message from... Stanley Pines! He's alive and needing help. So, it's back to Gravity Falls to solve the mystery of what happened to Ford and Stan Pines. And everything leads them to one place... the Bermuda Triangle.\n\n(I have a few other plot points for this but would love to discuss those w/ my partner and see what they'd wanna do with this!)\n\n*Other*\n\nI almost ALWAYS implement romance in my stories, preferences listed above! I have no limits other than maybe straight up furry stuff? We can talk about that in private, though! I'm very accommodating to limits and preferences, so let's just talk about it all!\n\nHere's some **fandoms** I'm into, and would be willing to write **original stories/characters** in (or be convince to write certain characterss):\n\n\\- Harry Potter/Wizarding World\n\n\\- Star Wars (movies only)\n\n\\- Stranger Things\n\n\\- Maze Runner (movies only)\n\n\\- Divergent (movies only oof)\n\n\\- Hunger Games\n\n\\- Steven Universe\n\n\u2014 X-Men/Marvel\n\nHere's some **original keywords** for inspiration!!!\n\nvampires// werewolves// age gap// 70s // 80s // 60s // 50s // superpowers// regency era// fantasy // haters to lovers // best friends // in a band together // gangs // demons // vices and virtues // soulmates // time travel // apocalypse // dystopian // noir // gay gay gay gay gAAAAAYYYYYYY\n\nSO YEAH!\n\nWe can converse and see if we'd be a good fit for each other! &lt;3 Signing off!",

I don\u2019t mean for our stories to be just angst and romance but it\u2019s definitely the cornerstone of a good engaging RP! At least for me. \n\n\nI\u2019ve been on a Star Wars craving lately, exploring the galaxy in a tiny ship with someone sounds like too much fun. We could be Jedi, mandalorians, smugglers, sith or anything in between! I love all characters and angles so please come at with me with anything you got! \n\nOther established universes I would have an interest in would include comic books, digimon, Valorant, league of legends, ATLA, persona and such! \n\nBut also don\u2019t be afraid to suggest an original one as well! Building from the ground up is thrilling. \n\nSo what I\u2019m trying to get at, any and all ideas are welcome! These are just some that popped in my mind while writing this.",

            "selftext": "\nTHE SUPERBOWL IS HERE! No better way to get back into the swing of things with an NFL themed roleplay. I hope you message me back letting me know you are interested. We need to talk about a few things in this role before we get going. I love using photographs for faceclaims, outfits, settings, etc.\n\nThis role takes place in Las Vegas, the Bandits (Las Vegas\u2019s successful football team) made it all the way to the league championship last year, but lost. It was an exciting run but they just were not a complete enough team. Shortly after the game, the long-time team quarterback retired. A void needed to be filled.\n\nThis role is centric on my character, Clifford D. Lewis, who is a young, up and coming quarterback. Clifford was drafted this year in the first round to come and play for the team. The pressure on him to deliver has been off the charts but he has conducted himself very professionally. Off season practices, mini camp, preseason games.. he has shown a tremendous amount of potential and the city in a buzz.\n\nWith Clifford here, his personal life has come into the spotlight more. Most assumed a young, 23 year old would be single and eligible but in college, Clifford got engaged to his long time highschool sweetheart. She\u2019s \u201cnice\u201d and \u201cpretty\u201d.\n\nWhere you come in is you have the option to play some females in Clifford\u2019s new NFL life. I want to leave you some options here to get you own creative mind flowing.\n\n1.\tCheerleader \u2013 clich\u00e9? Sure, but don\u2019t deny how exciting it is. The life of an NFL quarterback means long hours at the football stadium in the gym, in meeting, studying film\u2026 someone has to keep him company.\n2.\tSports Reporter \u2013 Since Clifford has done everything perfectly since getting drafted, the whole city is excited and media members are all over the young hunk. Including sports reporters who are desperate for all the exclusives.\n3.\tOwner\u2019s Daughter \u2013 The owners of NFL Teams are members of an exclusive wealthy club, the daughter of the owner of the Vegas team would certainly be used to getting whatever she wants\u2026\n4.     Celebrity \u2014 I mean, who can blame a guy, celebrities are some of the most attractive and eye-catching people on Earth, so what\u2019s wrong with wanting to start a romance with one?\n5.\tCome up with your own idea!\n\nI have years and years of playing experience. I look for longer posts to get us started and then typically do paragraph responses as we get into the play. \n\nThe way I see it, details are what matter most here. Since we can't physically see or touch one another, I need to be able to feel you through your writing - and you'll certainly feel the same from me.\n\nHope to hear from you soon! Xx.",

            "selftext": "Looking for a dark-themes long term partner\n\nI've been roleplaying for 4-5 years and use 3rd person only. Next, I only use OCs and ask you do the same. I ask you write in a lit style ( not like *this*) and write 1 liners, semi para, or paragraphs.\n\nWhile I can do modern, I specialize in 50s, medieval, or victorian settings. I can do human, but mostly do serious fantasy (like for vampires, think Interview With The Vampire. Immortal/Fantasy races experience hardships and I like to focus on that). I do work with a lot of darker themes and those elements are kind of all I do (especially with relationships), just to add some conflict. So I'm not really looking for a happy/fluff rp. \n\nThis would include things like toxic relationships, which I plan to have as a MAIN THEME. We\u2019re going to be traumatizing some poor OC here, be up for that. Note I am perfectly ok with having multiple roleplays with one person. Please have photos of all your characters, you don't need a bio. Edited/found photos and personally drawn photos are perfectly ok.\n\nI\u2019m not really interested in overly specific plots as it feels like there\u2019s an end in sight, I\u2019m looking for a roleplay that could, hypothetically, go on forever. I do have a list of prompts to go off of.\n\nAlso note that I am a minor! I\u2019m 16, I have no issues with my partners age, this is just a heads up.\n\nI use discord and Instagram exclusively to roleplay. Reach out if you're interested and we can go over guidelines and personal rules :)",

            "selftext": "\\*For those that are unaware, Coin Game is a slightly strange arcade simulator, with you being the only human being in a small town of robots in a place called Islandsville. I bought it recently and while my experiences have been middling, the setting and atmosphere are...inspiring. To say the least.\\*\n\n\"Would you like your receipt?\" I say, automatically, facing the customer with my practiced smile. They, in turn, do not smile. The grill of metallic, glowing yellow is all I get. The small egg-shaped robot, colored ocean blue with a ten-gallon hat and what appeared to be some kind of brown jacket stretching around its chassis, makes up for its less than human smiles with its voice, the yellow grill for a mouth blinking in tandem with words. \n\n\"No ma'am! I reckon there's no need.\" He says, a low southern drawl metalized with tin and electronics. I nod and grasp the bags from the bagging area, hefting them. Not exactly heavy, but for a robot, it was probably too much. \n\nAnd no, it wasn't oil and tin scraps that lay in the plastic bags. Eggs, milk, bread...human foods. Without much of a word, I follow him out into the cooling, dark air. I check my high tech watch, equipped with far too many amenities for something so small.\n\n6:57, Friday, 79 F, Islandville.\n\nI had been here for a week. You know, after I died. \n\nFrom what I remember it was a quick thing, one-minute I'm on the road the next I'm all over the asphalt. And the next...I'm waking up in a bed, with a letter, and a new shot at life. \n\nExcept it wasn't reincarnation it was purgatory with far too many oddities and talking robots for it to be spiritual. I'm the only human around, the rest being robots. Oh, sure, she had seen humans. Men and women in non-descript jumpsuits doing repairs on various things on the island or inspecting renovations, or working on adding more games to the various Arcades scattered around the town. \n\nThey wouldn't talk to me. \n\nIf you think I'm taking this rather well then you are correct. Well, no, I'm not. But I can pretend.\n\nThe arm-less Texan robot manages to shimmery his way into his truck, little odd spheres where his arms oughta be helping him, somehow. I'd touched one and they were both wet and solid, and sticky. \n\nI head back inside, pulling off the apron and going through the steps of cleaning up the small grocer, heading into the back to meet my manager. A tad portly, a red \"Islandville Grocer\" apron on his body, squiggles of black lines on his skin-colored head resembling middle-aged balding. \n\n\"...I'll be heading home sir.\" \n\n\"Be safe on the trip back. Oh!\" He seems to shudder for a moment, wobbling from side to side so hard I thought he'd fall over, \"Got a letter for you!\" He turns, \"walking\" to his desk in a small room with a segway like whir. I follow, holding the letter up, addressed to me. \n\nI open it. \n\nI read it aloud, squinting at the typed font.\n\n\"Yadda yadda, appearing on Islandville you have shown blah blah...\" I pause, \"...As such, we are admitting one new non-robotic resident to Islandville.\" I blink, reading the line once again in my head, and sighing. \n\nSaturday and Sunday were my days off. Usually I spent it in my room. Despite the isolated nature and secretive location of my predicament, it still had internet, and cable, and all those things. I just wasn't able to talk about where I was or any information that implicated this place. Beyond that I was free. \n\nBut I guess I would be tasked with giving this new person a runaround. \n\nFrowning, I fold the letter up and stuff it into my back pocket. \n\nThis wouldn't be easy.\n\n\\-----\n\nIf you have any question feel free to ask!",

Again) with another partner seeking post.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI posted one before to recruit for my medieval tastes and now I want to post for a SoL, Current or Quick RP search. I'm going to give a fleshed out options below and if we mesh? I hope you'll reach out.\n\nBefore we jump into those, I'd like to state that I will not under any circumstances RP with someone who is not 18 or older. Won't do it. Sorry, not sorry- I'm a single mum and I'm not risking it. \n\n**Genres I partake In:**\n\n*Slice of Life, College, Apocalyptic, Enemies turned Lovers, Rivals turned Lovers, Marriage to Benefit, Colleagues, Chance Encounters, Beach Vacations, etc.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n**I have a few requirements for any partners I partake in roleplay with, and I'm also seriously picky about my partner choices- so I do apologize ahead of time. \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffb**\n\n* *I am 18+ and can send confirmation of that if that is needed.*\n* *I currently work second shift, so I'm available sporadically all day. But mostly I'm not available from 4pm-6pm and 2am-7am.*\n* *I'm CST time zone. Which is GMT-6*\n* *I am more than willing to RP with someone that is outside of my own time zone or gender. Let's be friends! The big pond, or what's between our legs, doesn't define us!*\n* *I'm super flexible on what type we do from this sort or all the way to the other side of the spectrum and doing some other sort of roleplay. Up to you guys!*\n* *You must be 18+ and i won't make an exception. Sorry, kiddos.*\n* *I am open to other ideas my partner may have, and I often socialize in OOC chat- so expect a friendship to be built! Especially if we ever vocally call one another or game together.*\n* *I am what I'd consider a multi-para poster; and I often times try to match my partner's length when posting, even if that means dulling down my posts. I also don't always make super amazing posts, when I'm on my monthly or things are busy- so expect sporadic activity and post lengths.*\n* *The roleplay can take place on Discord OR here, but sometimes Line is easier to get ahold of me. Either or is fine with me.*\n* *I am a binary female, but I swing both ways. I primarily portray female characters but I can portray a side male if we need them to offer equal opportunity. I may branch out and portray male, if you promise to work with me until I get into the character mindset properly.*\n\n***Dm/Pm me for more information!***\n\nIf you'd like to do one of these, please feel free to reach out to me.",

I'm not a very picky person myself and I don't care about the skill level or gender of my partner. \n\nI've been roleplaying for roughly fourteen years, since I was quite young, and I've delved into just about every genre thus far.  My favorites tend to be fantasy and scifi, whether it be medieval, regency, antebellum, modern, futuristic, or anything in between. I also adore mystery, crime, slice of life,  romance,  and horrors of all time periods as well.  The only thing I don't delve into is Fandom roleplays.\n\nI will play either gender characters and have quite the roster for both. I also tend to be a bit impulsive, but I promise I have the patience to think things through,  too! Writing is just a very exciting venture to take with someone else, and I'm sure many of you agree. \n\nI would prefer to use Google docs but I am open to discussing other mediums as well.  \n\nCheers!",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone, I hope your day is going well! I'm llama, bean, or lavi, 18+ years of age, and living in the Eastern time zone. I'm currently craving FF7 while waiting for the next part of the remake, and while I'm mostly looking to double up for Canon x OC, I can play anything else for you, whether it's Canon x Canon or OC x OC. I may also be open to tripling (either polyships or love triangles) so feel free to ask about that if you like!\n\nI'm familiar with the compilation (except the novels) but I'm not super familiar on the lore/setting/world or anything, and you don't have to be either! If you expect perfection, I may not be the best partner for you.\n\nOn that note, I am completely open to AUs, canon-compliance, canon-divergences, playing extra NPCs, and I'm LGBTQ+ friendly, so although I prefer MxF for myself, I'm open to all pairing genders for you!\n\n**Just a few guidelines:**   \n\n\n\u2765 I'm looking for someone to play Rufus Shinra for my OC please. I can attempt to play (mostly) anybody else for you! \n\n\u2765  I roleplay through email or google docs, but can consider PM as a last resort. I unfortunately don't use or have discord.\n\n\u2765  I'm a sucker for romance, but I love relationships to build up slowly (at least for my half)! I enjoy a good story of drama, angst, overcoming hardships, etc. but if you want fast burn or pre-established relationships for your side, I'd be happy to accommodate!\n\n\u2765  I'm not picky on grammar, portrayals, spelling, etc. as long as it's nothing too major. I write about a paragraph or two per character, averaging about 4 paragraphs total? I can write more but I generally don't prefer to, as it takes me more time. Which brings me to my next point...\n\n\u2765  Reply speed: I aim for daily replies but sometimes I can be very slow (up to once a week or longer) depending on muse, inspiration, life, etc. If it's been close to two weeks with no response from me, please feel free to check in!\n\n\u2765  Please try to be as invested in both of our sides, keep posts fair and even, etc. I myself always try to put more care and effort into my partner's side. You don't really have to do the same but if I feel you're not as motivated or only seem to care about your half, I'll lose interest fast (sorry!)\n\n\u2765  On that note, I'm ghost friendly! I know things happen or bowing out can be awkward. I'll always try to notify partners if I lose interest or if I'll be away (especially if we've been rping together for a while), but sometimes anxiety or life happens and I can disappear. You're always free to message me again whenever though!\n\nIf all of that sounds good to you and you wish to plot something out together, please PM me! Thanks for reading and I look forward to hearing from some of you!",
