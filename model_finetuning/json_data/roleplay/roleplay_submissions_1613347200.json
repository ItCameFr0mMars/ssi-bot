            "selftext": " \n\nThousands of years ago, the fifteen chief gods that ruled over the inhabitants of Gheitz battled against evil spirits led by a powerful dark god. In the end, the 15 gods defeated the dark forces, sealing them away for two thousand years. Being weakened themselves, the fifteen gods disappeared and were quickly forgotten about by the races they protected. Years upon years later, the continent was in turmoil due to racism, the desperation for supplies, and religious difference. Races turned on each other and declared small wars, some species being hunted to extinction. Humans were the worst of these offenders in the past, sometimes wiping out whole races only for coin. One day, your family found a destroyed caravan on the side of the road, the entire small army slaughtered except for a small boy. Taking him in as one of their own, they raised the child beside you and you both became best friends. After some time, you both grew to adulthood, always on the lookout for adventure. We had found a map from a street vendor depicting a dungeon with enough gold to make a king Jealous, so we decided to leave our small village and be what we have always wanted to be. Adventurers.\n\nThanks for reading! I would prefer a partner who uses correct grammar and writes two or more paragraphs and also doesn't mind writing more than one character. You can be anything you want with any skills you want. I ask you to do something other than a human! If you have any questions, please ask!",

            "selftext": "Hey! Thank you for clicking on this. I wanted to do an rp where after an event, bruce is gone and sent me to the mansion. In this rp i could be his friend. But wasn\u2019t able to visit him. You are Barbra Gordon. The batwoman who takes charge for Bruce\u2019s job and batcave. I hope it sounds interesting. Also i would like to have someone who knows how to put detail in a rp. Thank you and i hope you enjoy!\n\nStarter;\nA stormy night, Bruce and you went on a mission together. The riddler held the mayor in a abandoned lighthouse. Bruce and you landed on a roof top. The light house\u2019s light spend around in a circle. Bruce narrowed his white eyes, scanning the ground by the entrance. Without looking at you he said \u201cTwo gunmen by the entrance\u201d he double tap the side of his cowl. He sees through the lighthouse walls. \u201cEach floor has TNT that could explode if Riddler sees us.\u201d He again double tap his cowl, to exit the X-Ray feature. \u201cI need you to use the camouflage feature of your suit, use the outside wall to crawl inside to take care of the TNT. I\u2019ll go to the front and take care of them. I\u2019ll meet you on the roof. I\u2019ll give you my signal\u201d bruce said to you. He leap off the roof and glide down to take care of the two men. You took care of each TNT to make sure it wont blow. Bruce shoot the grappling hook. It pulls him up to the top. He waits for you, but you were still figuring out how to take care of the last explosive. The riddler went to the top, seeing Bruce go up. He hits bruce fighting him. When you get to the top to see bruce, you saw bruce laying there, lifeless. \n\nAfter the event, in bruce\u2019s will, he gave you, everything since you and him had the best relationship. One night a few weeks later, you get back to the mansion from your day at work. You walked in to hear Alfred from another room. You walk to the room to see me. I had a phone call from bruce to come to Gotham to see him. Not knowing about the event. I smile seeing you walk in. Not knowing who you are. \u201cHey, where\u2019s bruce?\u201d I asked. You...(continue from there)\n\nConclusion:\nThank you for reading, just so i know you did send me the word \u201cBat armor\u201d and your discord name. Thank you!",

Or if you prefer to take a more \"Dm role\" that can work too\n\nROLES  \nPlease note these are vague descriptions. So Dm me to read full thing (please don't ask me to choose, these are listed because i like them, i can post all but that will be a lot of reading)\nI do value length and detail of posts naturally, and experienced roleplayers are  what im hoping for\n\n1) alternative wwll history \n\nHistory rewritten shows a different outcome in the war (Taken place before Rp3) Rumor's were spread on the eastern front of the Russian Demons on the other side, the stories to you were just that- rumors' spread by men sleep deprived, you didn't see it first hand either, but a new POW may change how much of it you did believe. \n\n\n2) mild science fiction modern roleplay\n\nIn a place where both Humanoid and humans live separately within the same society, one of them an assassin for hire; and you have need for her talents, or perhaps you are unfortunate enough to be the one to face her. (This role is one requiring you to be able to play various characters rather than just one main, the story follows a modern day soviet Russia, the lives of inhuman people and what happens next)\n\n\n3) Apocalyptic\n\nBased in a war gone hot and leading the world into ruin where survival is dictated by one owns initiative, there are no laws and life is short. And while many simply want to rebuild a life many still fight amongst themselves over empty wastelands and non-existent power. The humanoid soldiers who many blame for these events wander alongside us now, and yet they're the few who can survive what the world has become\n\n4) Scifi- future RP *NEW*\n\nRecruited for a Top secret mission within the KGB you are left with more questions than answers, rumors' were a recent mission into the nuclear winter that was a empty tundra in eastern Russia found leads to another key area, you and a small unit were given the task to follow these leads with no real idea what you were looking for\n\n5) demonic fantasy\nA growing presence of power develops over centuries on earth, at first only the imps and lesser demons could bother to sniff it out but in recent years even demon lords have become curious as to what is causing this- while they generally cannot manifest on earth it didn't hold back their curiosity.\n\nDM ME WITH ANY QUESTIONS AND THE ROLE YOU WANT MORE DETAILS ON\n\n\\[SERIOUSLY don't comment cause i probably wont see it\\]",

If you\u2019re interested in a plot below, don\u2019t hesitate to ask about possibly changing things or adding them! I\u2019m wanting this to be MxF on discord, preferably longterm. It\u2019s not necessary that you play more than one character, though usually I will so it would be appreciated. \n\nThere will be adult themes so 18+ only, I will not rp with minors!\n\n\n1. Your character is a mobster that runs the city. However, not too far away, there\u2019s another mobster your character doesn\u2019t get along with. His daughter (my character) would run into your character one day, though he never knew that his enemy had had a daughter. He could use her to crush said enemy, and end his bloodline, though she may also be of use in finding his enemy\u2019s weaknesses. \n\n2. Your character is the son of a (now ex) mafia boss who\u2019s recently passed on and left his legacy to his son. Before he\u2019d passed, his father had captured a woman who\u2019s father had crossed him. The father had offered the daughter as payment and then fled town. Now that your character has taken over, it\u2019s up to him what her fate is. \n\n3. You choose! Any mafia-related ideas you\u2019ve been wanting to try? I\u2019m all ears.",

I tend to reply with 2-3 paragraphs and more when struck by inspiration. I can both GM and play multiple roles as needed. I do respond multiple times a day, and will never ghost. I am currently on vacation this upcoming week. So you could have my undivided attention. \n\nI have recently had a new idea for a darker RP, and hope to find someone interested in joining me. I am looking for something long-term but am not opposed to a one-shot. I do like to chat OOC and get to know my partner.\n\nSo the RP Idea I have is that the female character gets captured, and later falls in love with her him. she begins to assist him throughout his antics. This could be a high fantasy, modern, or Apocalyptic theme. I do want this to be a darker romance and because of such, I am asking all inquirers to be over the age of 18.\n\nI am open to criticism, and changes to the storyline if it helps pique your interest. Please message me with your beverage of choice as the title so I know you at least skimmed through my post. My preferred medium for RP\u2019ing is discord. Which I will provide to you if we click and have some details worked out. \n\n\nThank you for reading and I hope to hear from you soon!\n\n-Nox",

This street was a special kind of broken, it was poverty struck, left out, left behind, almost empty, yet there were some silhouettes roaming, some lights still flickering..holding onto the invisible chord of urban life support. At a time like this, the street was undead, the perfect place to conduct foul business which only the latest hours of night could allow.  \n \n\nAlan\u2019s hands were trembling, so he tightly grabbed the steering wheel, until the leather of his gloves squeaked, until some veins popped, until it started to hurt..and finally, his hands relaxed, so he sighed and lit a cigarette while he waite for the awful message.  \n The phone chimed, \u201ccome in\u201d was the message, and Alan took a deep breath before leaving his car and then started walking towards the sorrowful G.R.C Warehouse.  \n \n\nTwo men wearing black suits greeted him at the entrance, \u201cI\u2019m the Janitor\u2026for Mr. Walsh\u2019s request\u201d said Alan in a stern calm voice. One of the two men nodded then turned around leading Alan in while the second man walked behind Alan, always keeping a mean eye on his back. Alan was used to such procedures, but it never stopped making him feel nervous\u2026especially around Mr. Walsh\u2019s men.  \n \n\nDarkness couldn\u2019t hide how despondent the building was, paint fell from the walls in fragments, the concrete was fractured, rust had invaded almost all the metallic surfaces, but what struck Alan the most was the smell, pungent and repellent, and it struck him so much because that smell didn\u2019t come from the building itself.  \n \n\nHe was finally lef to the room that needed \u201ccleaning\u201d, flickering lightbulb on top, dust and rust everywhere else, but in the middle\u2026there sat a small red hill of flesh, a pile of corpses drenched in their own blood, men, women, some lacked limbs, others lacked heads. Around the small hill, calmly stood a dozen of other men in suits..some of them had blood all over there faces. \u201cthe floor is yours\u201d one of the men said, and all of them took a few steps back while Alan stepped up to be closest to the corpses, he swallowed, rubbed his hands together, then he extended his arms in front of him, opening his hands to the pile of dead people\u2026and then\u2026 a dark greenish light rippled out of his palms, the light looked ephemeral but also tangible in the way it bent, and Alan ground his teeth as the light invaded the room\u2026 &gt;&gt;\n\nHey, I\u2019m looking for a semi-literate or literate partner to write a story in a contemporary/urban dark fantasy setting, the setting would be something the likes of the World of Darkness universe but not quite the same. The snippet I wrote is a little indication of my style but also the atmosphere I\u2019m looking for, something gritty, dark, mysterious and morose, so please think of a character which would fit in this sort of world. I will be playing as Alan the \u201cjanitor\u201d, you could be anything: vampire, witch, werewolf, human\u2026 as long as the story is cohesive and it\u2019d make sense to have both our characters interacting with each other, also it\u2019d be preferable if you\u2019re comfortable with occasionally managing multiple characters as I am no DM.  \n I\u2019m into character development and world building and discussing it so I\u2019d prefer a partner who\u2019s comfortable pitching in ideas and leading the story in ways that expand their vision of the world and characters.  \n As for characters and the story itself, I have some ideas yet nothing concrete, but I\u2019m confident that with the right partner we will end up coming up with an interesting plot.",

            "selftext": "Good evening! I'm hoping to find those who may be able to sate a certain roleplay theme I've been craving for. I've always been very much fascinated with the horror theme... especially when it involves a romance and adventure along with it. \n\nI've always found the \"Beauty and the Beast\" bond to be my favorite romance. A strange, dark that seems almost impossible for it to exist and yet it does. The bizarre melding of innocent light with passionate darkness. It's always been special to me, so I'm hoping I find someone who may feel a little the same way. \n\n \n\nI'm willing to write along with horror elements if that was to be involved. However, it isn't really necessary. I'm just looking for someone who is willing to play an opposite to my character. Non-human preferred. \n\nMy character: A sacrificed human gave herself up so her goddess would be able to recover from a terrible war that struck their home (the goddess' creation). Now the two have become one to transform into an entirely new being. Memories are fuzzy with her knowledge fresh with innocence an inexperience. Unfortunately, for some unknown reason she was tossed into a wormhole and ended up in a place that is not at all her home anymore. She has to adjust and explore. She has to survive while her magic and essence is quite the magnet for those seeking her. \n\nThe specific story will depend on who you're willing to play. I'd love you to come up with your own character but some examples are:\n\n- Any of the Hollywood Monsters or similar. Vampires, Frankenstein's Monster, Werewolves, Phantom of the Opera\n\n- Ghosts or demons (she's scared of the undead since she embodies life. This may add more drama)\n\n-Androids, Robots, Aliens, Synthetic\n\n- Dragons, orcs, goblins, DnD beings etc.\n\n-Plague Doctor, Wizards, Hunters\n\n-SCP or Lovecraft Characters \n\nPlease be able to write at least a few sentences. If you'd like to know what else I'm into feel free to p m  me as well as options of where we can start the RP. Thank you for reading!\n\nEdit: I want to be clear about something. The monster/antagonistic character is also the romance partner too that's why I mention the \"Beauty and the Beast\" relation style.",

I can be both literate and semi-lit depending on the person I'm roleplaying with and the roleplay itself. I mostly do romance types of roleplays and enjoy building up the story between the two people. I enjoy fantasy as well.\u00a0\n\nIf there is anyone, preferably male, writers who are interested in roleplaying or have ideas of their own for a roleplay. Please feel free to PM! Also sometimes their might be times where I cannot answer and that's either because I am working, doing college things or busy with something else. just a little heads up.",

(except for a lot of really literate people. PogChamp for you guys \\^\\^)   \nAnd for the people that don't wanna use fillers or something like that, their replies look Small, and they're labeled as \"Bad Roleplayers.\" What I try to look for when roleplaying is the contents of what people write and whether or not they can spark a story out of whatever! I think it's super cool to see people Write so little and spark so much interest in a roleplay's lore or story.  \nKeep in mind that I'm not talking about everybody with these few categories.

            "selftext": "Disclaimer: **Male authors, please stop contacting me.** I've been burned too many times. If you persist, I'll ignore your message.\n\nHello, you can call me Doe! I'm 25+ and a proud cat mom. I write multiple paragraphs/novella style (200-500+words). I love to write detailed descriptions and delve into a character\u2019s head/emotions as well as   surroundings. I compare it to writing a novel together.\n\nI understand if the scene doesn\u2019t have alot going on and therefore  requires less like rapid fire. I adore having long, thoughtful replies  where we truly immerse ourselves in the world. I'm hoping to find a      partner whose as enthusiastic and passionate about the plot and writing  as I am. When I get invested in a story, it\u2019s 100% dedication. Getting a   reply is the highlight of my day.\n\nI'm a big fan of romance and using face claims. I\u2019m the type to make pinterest boards, spam you with gifs, headcanons, and send you songs   that remind me of our characters and/or ship. I'll get excited if we  come up with future plot ideas, or if our characters are being cute or angsty and I can yell about it in the chat.\n\nLast but not least I only do MxF (with *myself* in the female role) and don\u2019t double, but I\u2019m more than happy to write  side characters of either gender to help move the story along. I'd highly prefer female authors writing older male characters.\n\nDesperately Searching For\n\n\\- 21+ partners\n\n\\-    For you to have an excellent grasp of grammar, punctuation, spelling, and capitalization. Both in character and out of character. (Literate   to advanced writers only, please. I'm not looking for newbies or those  who have English as their second/third language).\n\n\\-    The more description, the better! I'm looking for someone who can  write as much as me (2 to 4 paragraphs or more) and really bring the story to life. I lose interest/feel discouraged if I only get one            sentence in reply while trying to build the plot/develop characters.\n\n\\-    Joining me in the wonderful world of ship/character development is kind of a must. It\u2019s one of the things that makes writing with a partner so much fun. I also like to make friends with my partners!\n\n\\-    While I'd prefer real life face claims, I'd also be open to using  realistic art if you're uncomfortable with real life. I draw the line at  anime/cartoon art.\n\n(Since I've gotten some messages about it, I'd like to say I have **zero interest** in **slice of life** or **historical** plots)\n\nOriginal Genres:\n\n\\* Crime\n\n\\* Post Apocalyptic/Dystopia\n\n\\* Supernatural/Modern Fantasy\n\n\\* Southern/Mid-Western/Urban Gothic\n\n\\* Sci-fi\n\n\\* Superpowers/Gifted\n\nFandoms: (I don't write canons or do canon x oc)\n\nStar Wars, X Files, Haven, Fringe, Stranger Things, Heroes, The Wolf Among Us, **Mercy Thompson Series, True Blood**,  Marvel, The OA, Disney personified, His Dark Materials, Beastars,   Horizon Zero Dawn, The Last of Us (I've been dying to write against  Joel)\n\nAll my characters will be adults and I require my partners to do the same, as there *will*  be adult themes in my writing. For more plot and genre ideas, message me \\^\\^ I can write over email or discord, and if we click I'd be happy to give out that info.\n\nPlease be  detailed when you message me, let me know why you chose to contact me. Seeing only \"hey do you wanna rp?\" is a guaranteed way to turn me  off.\n\nLook forward to hearing from you!",

The short version goes something like this.\n\nOC is a healer/self trained mage that is traveling a path of her own when she lands in a spot of trouble.  Geralt does what he does best and she feels indebted to him so she offers to accompany him and be his full time healer until she feels she has payed back the debt she owes him.\n\nThere is much more to the story than that with a fair few twists and turns along the way, and this story could work in the combined book/game timeline or just the show timeline if that is all you've been exposed to so far.\n\nA few rules about me.  I don't double, I don't play CC, and I don't play against OCs.  Everything else can be discussed in chat or messages.  I'm a really laid back person and am very easy to get along with so long as you communicate with me and don't just leave me hanging or ghost me.\n\nIf this sounds like it might be up your alley, shoot.me a chat or a message!",

            "selftext": "\nWith the publicity the Court of Owls is getting, and the Caped Crusader being very relevant... I figured I\u2019d try my luck. I do hope you enjoy reading this advertisement!\nI\u2019ve been a fan of Batman for as long as I can remember- my comic collection began to pile and pile up; I watched every movie, TV series, and played any game related to him times over. Soon I began to understand him absolutely- his brooding and protectiveness; his immense intellect to his sheer ferocity. Coupled with the fact I love to write... I just knew I had to be him. \n\nSo, what\u2019s a Batman without his Catwoman? I\u2019m looking for someone to take the mantle of Selina Kyle as we explore the duo taking on what is possibly their biggest challenge yet- together. \nI am looking for an adv-lit/novella partner for this; as I want to really dive into the complexity of our characters, and Gotham City\u2014 really enjoy the story. I probably don\u2019t have to say this, but there will definitely be romance, and that will actually be a big part of this Roleplay. You also must be okay with some mature themes- such as strong language and gore, because Gotham is a deep, dark place... that goes without saying. I don\u2019t mind if you don\u2019t completely know DC inside-and-out, but at least hold some knowledge of Batman\u2019s immediate allies and villains- also known as the Rogues Gallery. I do intend for us to balance out playing side characters such as the Bat Family, and the all-important villains. I think that\u2019s all of my requirements out the way! Please do enjoy the plot below- let it be known I have a Discord, which is largely prefer RP\u2019ing on. I can give that out in DM\u2019s. Please don\u2019t contact me via Reddit\u2019s chat system, as I will only be answering my PM\u2019s.\n\n\nPlot:\n\n\n2021, Gotham City, the State of New Jersey. \nThe solemn streets, slick with rain, howl a hallowed past, and allude to the dark future of the mega city. \nNeon scintillates in puddles, the luminescent gloom of Wayne Enterprises. \nFor once, it\u2019s quiet. \nGothamites know what it\u2019s like to live again- as humans. \nAll until The Dark Knight stumbles upon a lone cadaver, stowed away on the smoky, gritty rooftops of Gotham\u2019s East End. \nFaceless, mutilated; its gender stripped from it, from diabolical surgical meddling.  \nEven to the grizzled, hardened vigilante, it\u2019s a grim sight. \nNext to it, on the archaic, charcoal black bricks: \u201cIMPERFECT\u201d, written in cheap white paint, as if it was a form printed From a computer... a steady hand conveying its message to the world. \nThis was no murder, robbery, assault.\nThis was a targeted crime against humanity. \nAnd Batman was working on borrowed time, until he struck again.\n\nThough the reign of the Caped Crusader was famed and absolute, the East End had its own reluctant protector... the elusive Catwoman.\nUpon her mischievous deeds, the cat burglar stumbles upon a similar sight- a deceased soul, carved in the same way. \nBatman and Catwoman decide to partner up, to catch this abhorrent killer...\nBut, unbeknownst to them, it was all a distraction. \nA deep seated malevolent corruption Imbeds itself within City Hall, using the string of shocking murders as something to keep Gotham\u2019s protector occupied. \nNow the unlikely duo is forced to do more than simply investigate a murder, but save Gotham City from an invasion centuries in the making...\nThe Court of Owls have decided to strike- with Batman and Catwoman being the only driving force to stop them. \nWith an attack from all fronts, the duo bond in a fight for their lives...",

Sure, you could very easily be the maniacal, K-Mart version of Sauron. That's the role that's been given to you but there's nothing stopping you from going your own path, and regardless of what you do, your Minions will follow. Sure, they're mischievous and prone to stupidity but they're fiercely loyal!\n\nYou could be a force of good, trying to keep the peace of these lands. You could be a regular adventurer who dungeon crawls, with your little friendly Minions to help. You could be trying to save your long lost family!  You could be anything, and sure, the mechanics of being an Overlord may make things difficult, but you're your own person!\n\nYou're free to be what you want to be!\n\nIf you're wanting to give this a shot, feel free to message me so we can chat!",

I\u2019ve been dealing with some personal and family issues lately, but I\u2019m feeling refreshed and ready to start an rp!\n\nToday I just finished the campaign for the most recent Call of Duty game and am feeling inspired by it! I\u2019ve never attempted a historical and/or military rp, but am excited to try! I would love to include a romance element as well.\n\nAs for stories in general, I love them to be full of drama, angst, love, action, etc. For pairings, I prefer LGBT pairings, especially MxM! \n\nRequirements: \n\n- Must be 18+, this is non-negotiable. Thank you! \n\n- Must write in 3rd person (past tense is preferred)\n\n- Be semi-lit to lit (I love love loveee detail! The more the better!) I typically write 3-4 paragraphs as a response and it would be awesome if you could do the same!\n\n- I always am enthusiastic about my characters, so I would appreciate it if you could be as well! (It honestly makes the whole process much more enjoyable)\n\n- I really want to make a new friend, so participating in OOC chat would be preferred! \n\n- I mainly use Discord but am open to other platforms if needed! \n\n- I\u2019ve recently graduated from college and hunting for jobs so please be patient and understanding! I don\u2019t expect your world to revolve around our rp and believe that should be mutual! (Although I do love enthusiasm!)\n\n- I enjoy using character sheets and face claims, if we could use both that would be great!\n\nIf this seems interesting to you, I\u2019d love to hear of any specific characters or ideas you may have! Thanks for reading!",

I am from the UK and I either roleplay on here through chat or I roleplay on discord. I prefer to roleplay in first person, however, I can also roleplay in third person. I use full sentences and attempt to try and keep my replies to roughly 5 or 6 sentences if possible so approximately a paragraph every time. I also use quotation marks when my character is speaking.\n\nNow to what I'm looking for. So I'm looking for a long term roleplay partner to do a story based roleplay. the roleplay i am looking to do is a petplay/puppyplay roleplay. I prefer my roleplay to explore the different aspects of this kind of roleplay such as from how I would become yours, the training process and everything after.\n\nFor anyone interested, just message me and we can get discussing about the roleplay in which we will create together. However, only message if you are interested in roleplaying please. I have had several people reply then say they aren't interested or they have just ghosted me.\n\nI would prefer to keep the roleplay in a modern setting as well. Furthermore, the roleplay would be female x male",

The Marshland Region\n2. The Rendal Territory\n3. The Atmora Region\n4. The Draften Region\n\nAll of the 4 regions are hungry for power and land, and are constantly fighting each other, have it be through diplomacy or all out war.\n\n2 commoners from the Marshland Region, the poorest out of all of the region, wish for a better life. We become mercenary\u2019s, fighting for whatever side had more coin to put in our pockets. We fought mainly for the Atmora Regions leader, as they were willing to pay us more than the rest of the Regions, so the start of the roleplay will begin here.\n\nWhile we fight in a skirmish with the Rendal region, something no one could\u2019ve possibly expected happens; a dragon-riding masked man attacks. We barely escape with our lives, fleeing into enemy territory. Lost and afraid, our main goal is now to survive, and choose a next course of action once we\u2019ve made it back to safe territory.\n\nHi! I\u2019m Marq, and (if you already couldn\u2019t tell)) this is my first time doing a big roleplay like this. I\u2019m looking for someone to help me with this, someone who\u2019s at least literate and more experienced in roleplays like this. If you could help me through this, we could make a very interesting story. I would like romance to be involved, but not the main focus of this story. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested, or have any questions, please dm me and ask away! I really hope someone could help me create something amazing!",

            "selftext": "Hey! I'm currently looking for someone to do a fantasy-esque roleplay based in the Elder Scrolls universe. I'm also pretty busy as I have college and a job so I probably won't be able to do much. I'm fairly knowledgeable of TES and can probably think of some other ideas. I'm also available to other ideas if you so choose.\n\nAbout Me: I'm a college freshman who's spent most of his teenage years roleplaying. I absolutely adore fantasy-based games such as The Elder Scrolls and Dragon Age. I'm not particularly picky when it comes to your knowledge in a RP, all I ask is you know what you are talking about! I'm also a very busy person (usually able to roleplay on Mondays to Wednesdays, but may be online in between also).\n\nI mainly do roleplays based in games such as The Elder Scrolls, Fallout, and whatever else you want. I usually respond in around 2-3 sentences if I can. I'm a sucker for romance &amp; love triangles. I also tend to add in some humor into these roleplays just to lighten the mood a bit. My roleplays usually last a week to a few months depending on if it's good or not. \n\nI love to develop new characters, send/make memes, imagine our characters &amp; create them in-game, and just chat about fuckall!\n\n^(P.S: I may not respond right away as I tend to take sleep meds during the day as a way to cope with mental illness.)",

Some exceptions for Europeans if it's reasonable enough.\n\nWe don't expect you to write novellas, but 2-3 nicely structured paragraphs should suffice.\n\nWe're looking for a \"Rapid Fire\" type of RP, which means exchanges replies back and forth. We are not looking for \"Email Roleplayers\" where there's only one reply every once in a while.\n\nBasically, we would be two people worldbuilding around your character. We have been roleplaying for nearly two years together with extremely intricate characters and a solid plot with neverending content.\n\nWe wanted to experiment how it would be with a third person that would experience what we initially experience, but with two GMs this time! \n\n(Hint: Your character would be on Earth and would be visited by two strange beings, and the story picks up from there). You not knowing any context about our story would add to the sheer realism of the roleplay where the Human is shocked and confused about the two non-humans visiting him.\n\nThen your character will make choices and adjust to the new life that is about to happen to them.\n\nWe use Discord for RP as we can easily structure it.\n\nIf you're interested, send a message!",

            "selftext": "Hi :)\n\nLooking for partners to do some rp ideas with! I really like supernatural/fantasy type of plots written in 3rd person, so ideas that would involve witches, werewolves, vampires, demons, and similar beings such as that :) I myself am female, in my twenties, and like plots that involve DRAMA and romance lol.\n\nSo what I'm looking for in a partner includes the following:\n\n\\- 18+ (so we can include any gore, love, or swearing)\n\n\\- Be able to do semi-literate to literate responses (NO ONE LINERS!)\n\n\\- Can be relatively active (looking for at least 3 responses a day)\n\nThat's pretty much it! :D If you're interested, dm me and we can brainstorm a supernatural plot together :) Let me know if you have a preference between something like vampires or witches and we can work with our ideas to create something great and immersive with our characters! And to make sure you've read this post in its entirety, when you send me a dm, make sure to include your favorite color so I know you read until this point! Thank you!",

However it's difficult to stop their attraction and evident chemistry. For him, it's new and exciting how for a change someone isn't throwing themselves at him. He enjoys the challenge; there's plenty to work with.\n\nJust a few ideas. I'm more than happy to develop this further.\n\nDiscord preferred.

            "selftext": "Hello :)  \nI am female, late 20s, and looking for a few new roleplay partners. I am a literate roleplayer, 3rd person, happy to write anything from a couple of paragraphs up to a full page in response, depending on my partner/what the situation calls for. I\u2019m happy to match whatever works for the roleplay and/or my partner\u2019s preferences. \n\nI would like for my partners to be 21+, as I\u2019m not the youngest roleplayer out there and wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable writing with anyone younger. As far as gender goes, I don\u2019t have any kind of preference on what you or your character is, anything is good with me. The same with pairings, anything works - M/F, M/M, F/F, and that applies to any plot/fandom. \n\nI\u2019m happy to roleplay either gender, although the majority of my existing characters are male. I\u2019d like to have multiple characters, either main or side characters, as it adds a lot more depth to a story, and I would like it if you were looking to play multiple characters too. Again, gender doesn\u2019t matter. \n\nI\u2019m looking for SFW/ fade to black works for me, I\u2019m not interested in writing otherwise, but romance is all good though - although not a requirement either. \n\nOriginal concepts I\u2019d like to roleplay: \n\n* Medieval/Victorian/Modern Fantasy.   \nI don\u2019t have any particular plots in mind, but I do have a wide range of characters I\u2019d be interested in throwing into any time period setting. They range from disgraced knights to adventurers/thieves who are great at making themselves out to be a hero but not so great at it when put to the test, to a sorceress with a questionable moral compass, all the way up to royalty (I actually have a couple of princes who may or may not have committed regicide that I\u2019d love someone to play off against)  \nI\u2019m open to as much or as little when it comes to fantasy elements involved, so we can always discuss that further. \n* I have a couple of Fae characters I\u2019m really interested in fleshing out at the moment too so please let me know if that\u2019s possible! \n* Angel/Demon (or any combination of the two, and with some unwitting humans mixed in too). With this I have a Lucifer I\u2019d like to play, and he\u2019d work with literally any race. \n* Good old fashioned Vampire themes   \nOver the years I\u2019ve had many vampires and vampire hunters as characters, and I\u2019m happy to play as either, or both. I have a few specific vampire OCs I\u2019m itching to play at the moment, but, if you\u2019re interested we can discuss that in a dm.  Would love to hear any plot ideas you might have, as I have characters for pretty much any scenario. \n* Sci-fi/Future Fantasy  \nThis isn\u2019t something I\u2019ve had any real exposure to, but would be really keen to give a shot - so if you have any plots in this kind of genre I\u2019d be open to giving it a go.   \nFandoms -  \nI\u2019m not really one for fandom roleplays, as I don\u2019t tend to keep up to much, but a couple I\u2019m really interested in and would never say no to at the moment are:   \nFinal Fantasy VII - open to be set in the remake timeline, Crisis Core period, or AU. Characters I\u2019d be most interested in playing are Sephiroth (especially Crisis Core Sephiroth), Zack, Vincent, Cloud, Genesis, Aerith. /multiples and others too. I don\u2019t mind so much who you play, or what pairings either, I\u2019m pretty flexible. I am OC friendly, but, please also play canon to keep things interesting.   \nFinal Fantasy XV - again, absolutely anywhere in the timeline is fine, even pre/post game, or AU. With this, I\u2019m very open on who I play and pairings, as well as multiples and storylines - I don\u2019t think there\u2019s really anything I\u2019d say no to, so bring me your OTP. \n\nMy preference would be email or discord, maybe gdocs. I\u2019m not too bothered by how frequently you can post - I appreciate everyone has a life, as long as I\u2019m kept in the loop it\u2019s all good. \n\nAnd I think that\u2019s everything\u2026 So if you\u2019re interested or want to discuss further, just drop me a message with what you\u2019re interested in brainstorming and how old you are, and let\u2019s see if we click.",

            "selftext": "Hi there! The past few weeks, I have been absolutely obsessed with Stardew Valley. I had never played it before but have quickly fallen in love with the gameplay and characters! With that in mind, today I am hoping to do a romantic story style roleplay (without cutscenes, hearts etc)! I am looking for anyone to play as either Shane or Sam, so if you\u2019re up to filling either, let\u2019s collaborate! I would also like to make something organic and new rather than just taking the events straight from the game.\n\nWhile this may shock some given my post history, this can be MxM OR MxF, though I will say MxM will certainly get better attention. In addition, I can also double up and do any gender pairing if needed! \n\n~Rules~\n1. Please be literate. No text talk or bad grammar (minus OOC chatting). 3rd person only. In terms of length, I do not expect novella, however your responses should show effort and move the story forward. \n2. Please be relatively active. I understand we all have busy lives, however if you ghost or aren\u2019t around for long periods of time, I am not the partner for you. If you aren\u2019t feeling our plot or want to part ways, just communicate!\n3. I am 20+ and all participants and characters must also be 20+, absolutely no exceptions. \n4. Let\u2019s have fun and be friends! Let\u2019s chat OOC and talk about our days! As much as I love roleplaying, I love getting to know my partners as well! \n\nAnd I think that about covers it! If you\u2019re interested, please shoot me a PM and we can discuss specifics! Thank you for reading and I hope you have a wonderful day!",

I usually roleplay on Discord and Kik, but I\u2019m up for anything like I\u2019ll say a bunch of times that makes you \n\nI\u2019m currently bored and just looking for a long term roleplay partner to help me through that. Give me someone to chat with during the long days of working from home. \n\nI usually do slice of life plays, some fantasy, really anything as long as it has some drama, plot twists, and everything to keep the plot interesting and flowing. It will have sex scenes but it won\u2019t be the whole focus of the play! I usually play in 1st person but also can do 3rd person, so we can work with whatever you are comfortable with playing in. \n\nSo if you\u2019re interested, please send me a message, and we can discuss everything! I will be around most of the day today! \n\nSo if you made it this far, I hope that you have a wonderful day, and stay safe! \n\nSean",

I\u2019d prefer my partner be over 20 years old.\n\n-I can rp both genders, but I usually have my main character be a female.  I generally only do hetero pairings.\n\n-I typically write anywhere from 3-5 paragraphs. I\u2019d ask my partner do their best to match.\n\n-I can typically get a couple of responses in a day, and i\u2019d ask that my partner does the same.  \n\n-I\u2019d like plot to be the central aspect, with a romance subplot aswell! We can discuss this further once we get to talking.\n\n-If I ever cannot respond for some reason, I\u2019ll do my best to give you a days notice! I\u2019d ask the same, but obviously there are some things that you can predict.\n\nSo, here\u2019s a couple of base premises.\nif ya\u2019 aren\u2019t fond of one in particular, we can definitely shift some things around and combine some of \u2018em!\n\n- Two characters, who after having some sort of wrong done against them, go on a wild goose chase for revenge.  During this, they find themselves getting involved in something MUCH bigger than they originally thought. Maybe some governmental conspiracy-esque stuff.  We could also toss a fantastical element in here, though maybe with more of a low-key sorta thing.  Maybe the \u201cwrong\u201d committed leads to the death of one of the characters, making them some sort of spiritual/devilish/whatever being hellbent on avenging their own death (along with their human friend, of course). We could play this in a enemies turned to friends sorta way too! Also, doing it without the fantasy element is totally cool in my book.\n\n- Two college kids who get involved in, you guessed it, something MUCH larger than just the two of them.  I was thinking more cosmic-horror elements here.  Maybe two people discover that they have stumbled upon some sort of supernatural phenomena that they can finish (we could do an urban legend twist here.  Think ghostbusters except with more legend-based myths and less survivable odds.",

            "selftext": "Hi everyone\n\nThis is a prompt I've wanted to do for a long time but just never found a partner who was commited enough. I need someone who can write nice detailed posts\n\n\n\"Megan Jones is just your average big city cop. She works hard trying to keep the peace and mostly keeps things civil. Her life has all the excitement she needs right now. However, all that changed one fateful night. During a struggle with a suspect, she accidently tastes some of their blood. What\u2019s worse is she actually sort of liked it? She tries to just forget about it and get herself cleaned. But something inside her just won\u2019t let it go. She starts getting the shakes and needs to taste it again. Soon things escalate to the point where she starts moving on to human flesh. First by taking pieces from the morgue but eventually that\u2019s not enough. She needs warm, fresh meat. Soon a wave of disappearances happen all across the city as Megan needs to satisfy her cravings. It becomes more and more difficult for her to act nonchalant around her colleagues as they start to notice her increasingly erratic behaviour\"  \n\n\nSo if you're interested in my twisted tale please feel free to send me a message. I can rp either on reddit or discord. \n\nThanks!",

            "selftext": "Looking for fellow canon x canon shippers for the following fandoms: Hunger Games, Queen's Gambit, The Maze Runner, Naruto, MHA, Godless, Death Note, ATLA, LOK, GoT, FE3H, Harry Potter, dot hack, Fruits Basket, Doctor Who, MCU and Netflix, Yu Yu Hakusho, Law and Order SVU, Star vs The Forces of Evil, Star Trek, Rick and Morty, and Yokai Watch.\n\nAll canons and lore will be adjusted to ensure our characters are 18 years or older. For instance, in MHA UA will be changed to a university and for Naruto, the Academy goes from 12-18 so all graduates put into teams will be 18. And in Star vs The Forces of Evil, our RP won't begin until Star and Marco are adults, entering community college. Or that the school Star visited in the first season, was already community college. Or for Yu Yu Hakusho, Yusuke would be a college student, as opposed to middle school. Those are just some examples but the rest of the fandoms will be adjusted similarly.\n\nI can play either gender but prefer writing against male writers. I am in my early 30s and want someone is also at least in their mid-20s for the sake of us having similar outside expectations and obligations. I post when I can and don't hassle folks to reply unless it's been over a week. Heck, if you need to take a few weeks off from posting, that's fine if you communicate that. I'm pretty lax and understanding. We all have lives outside of this hobby. I am currently going back to school so my time varies. That said, I am active in OOC if you are. If you wanna talk about your day and need to vent, that's awesome. I enjoy a good back and forth with my partners, if you're on the quiet side, that's okay but I still expect us to plot about our story at least.\n\nGenerally I write via discord and give about 1-2 posts (per its character limit), depending on the scene (aka about 4-5 paragraphs total). I love slice of life and romance, action is not my strong suit but I am eager to improve in that area as well. Something slow burn is ideal. I'm not looking to inject too much drama into my stories however, life is stressful enough. Things like love triangles don't interest me in the slightest. I enjoy challenges when characters can come out of the other side for the better. I do not enjoy mentally torturing characters for the sake of drama. It's so draining.\n\nAnything else, we can figure out via PM. If you're curious about something not listed or something celeb based, still reach out. Also crossovers can be super fun too. I'm pretty open-minded! I don't want to move to discord until we've talked a little bit and get a feel for one another and that we're on the same page.",

Looking for partners to write with in the Star Wars realm. \n\nI have a developed back story for a coming of age character who is force sensitive and must escape from captivity. What we do after we escape and how your character can help is up to us to determine. I'm open to a range of possibilities and find that the best RP's happen when we have a chance to collaborate before, during and after the process - which is why I prefer Discord. I think stories with romantic tension are always more enjoyable so I am looking to include that in some aspect. \n\nIf this sounds like something you might like to work on shoot me a message here and we will discuss further. Potential partners should be 18+ please. Looking forward to hearing from you!",

In my mind their situation is a tenuous one, barely held onto as numerous crises threaten to overcome them, demanding clever decision-making and policies to save their own skin as well as those they've been charged to protect.\n\nI write at length, appreciate inventive uses of the English language and metaphor, and would appreciate a partner whom does the same",

            "selftext": "Hey there  I'm Jade. I'm 20 years old from US and a working woman, so only read further if you're fine with late replies. Late replies but long replies for sure. I also don't expect you to reply immediately. I understand there's life beyond roleplay which has higher priority.  I have been role-playing for a long time now and prefer to be very detailed in my responses to be very honest. It is fine not to be detailed all the time but on an average I like to keep my responses long enough.  I'm looking for applications of new possible roleplays/plots which are long term and takes time to build in it's own possible way.  I enjoy slice of life a lot. Another thing that I enjoy is adventure and world building. Okay, on a second thought World building can be at the top of the like list.  An ideal roleplay partner would be the one who could he equally detailed as I'm and who will involve themselves actively in story building process. I also like to connect of the roleplay premises. I like to build a personal connection too.  So if you relate to any of the values listed above message me with \"Application for roleplay\" as subject and also no \"hi\" or \"hey\" will he entertained. Please only reach out to me with what you've in mind with some workable details or a plot. A story would be perfect for a reply.  Love Jade",

            "selftext": "Greetings, all!\n\nI'm a longtime One Piece fan and semi-experienced DM/GM looking to test out some play of the world I'm writing up for my friends and potential players in the future.\n\nEssentially, the world is an AU and roughly takes place about three decades after the Whole Cake arc, prior to the events of Wano. There's a bit to explain but it takes place after a dark period in the One Piece world, with a new generation of pirates ready to rise to the occasion!\n\nThat's the main premise! This is mainly going to be 1-on-1 play, with a lot of tailoring and developing of characters and sheets beforehand. I will be using Fate Accelerated (specifically, a slight modification of Dresden Files Accelerated) to implement play, and it would be very helpful if you know the basic rules but it's not required. Most likely, I will do separate one-shots with folks. Doing a campaign is really dependent on how well things flow.\n\nI hope to GM this on Discord, with a Fate/Fudge Dice bot doing rolls.\n\nA couple notes:\n\n- As stated in the tags, this is going to be text-based and PBP. I'm pretty laidback with how I run games and have gotten to be pretty patient with people's reply times. I'm in PST so some time difference is to be expected.\n\n- As a result of this being primarily text-based, I'm really only interested in doing play with folks who are literate. Not an insane amount, mind you, but a paragraph minimum of good detail and lacking any notable grammar or spelling issues (a few is fine) would be very much preferred. More is always nice!\n\n- While I expect very Shonen-Jumpy combat to take place (it's really what I'm looking to test), I would like if RP and character interaction/development remained part of a strong focus of the game. So anyone just looking to come punch things, this probably isn't for you! (Sorry.)\n\n- Please don't expect things to run *super* smooth, as this is a test of the world using FAE. I apologize if there are any hiccups but I do promise to resolve them as best I can!  \n\n- For my own comfortability, I would prefer if only +18 folk apply, as I am myself.\n\nThat's about it! If you're interested, DM me some characters ideas you have, maybe a Devil Fruit idea I can mercilessly tear down (just kidding...or am I?), but, most importantly, a sample of your writing.\n\nThank you for reading all this and have a pleasant day!",

            "selftext": "hello everyone, I would like to find a partner for a roleplay, preferably longterm, based on a love story between a prince and his maid. the setting will be medieval and you can decide whether to add fantasy elements or not. i am looking for someone who is at least 18 years old.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPLOT:\n\nthe kingdom of Rho, one of the greatest kingdoms in the world, an economic and a military power. for years wars of conquest towards new lands have been underway and expanding the kingdom. the monarchy rules, a hereditary moachia with King Charles and Queen Antoinette in power. among their children only the first male gender, as per tradition, can succeed the throne and lead the kingdom at the mote of King Charles.\n\nthe first son is prince lucas, from an early age his duty was to learn why one day he would become king. his position of power is much higher than the others over his brothers and sisters. everyone knows that whoever does him wrong now will have to pay the consequences when he becomes king. he is married to princess margaret, obviously not a decided marriage between the two but a marriage arranged for alliances of power.\n\nthe second and the third daughter are Princess Alyssa, now no longer in the kingdom of Rho since she was married to the prince of Venora, and Princess Ulla, still unmarried who in the last period met several princes and probably also she will be married shortly.\n\nfinally my character, Prince Marcus, the youngest son. Unlike children who can be married, a male child has a much lower value for alliances. his whereabouts are still unknown, few princesses have come to meet him and none have finally shown interest in him, probably not because of his looks but because of his low value in terms of alliance. his estine is also unknown to him. the attentions of his parents cared more for his brother and sisters. perhaps if he does not find a companion, worthy of taint with a prince, his parents will make him become a clergyman.\n\nlastly there is the princess Dorothea, she is still too young for now but soon she too will be looking for a partner, it is a matter of a maximum of two years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nmy idea is a romance between me (prince) and you (maid). I want to face all the dynamics of a love of this type: infatuation, secret love, love hindered by my social condition, etc ...\n\nmy basic idea is that you are the new maid but i would rather decide these details with a breainstorm.\n\nI hope to hear from you soon, contact me in chat or in pm, if you want I can give you my discord",

            "selftext": "Hello! \n\nI'm currently looking for a partner who has a decent amount of time and heaps of enthusiasm. I've been roleplaying for an embarrassingly long time at this point and few things make me happier than really fleshing out a story with a fellow writer. If you want a partner who comes with ideas, writes quality posts, and will flood you with headcanons and ship songs -- it me. I'm also a ***huge*** fan of faceclaims and can even include icons with my posts, if you'd like! \n\nRight now, I've been **REALLY** craving some MCU play. I've got a bunch of ideas for both plots and characters from that universe. I'd even be open to writing multiple characters and tapping into the vastness of the franchise.  I'm also *super* into crossing over my main girl, Lara Croft, into that world. She fits in a shockingly well there.\n\nAnd speaking of Lara, I'm **always** up to write her; whether it be a different crossover or a completely original storyline. I've been literally roleplaying as her since I was eleven, (Embarrassing, I know.) But as dorky as that is, it also means that writing her is incredibly easy for me. Even on bad days, it's not hard for me to step into Lara's laced-up boots. I always have some plots for her lying around -- ranging from straight-up adventures to lighter, cuter romantic arcs. \n\nI enjoy plots with Lara more than anything else. I'll always perk up when someone wants to write opposite her; especially if their interest is more about her personality and history rather than her bombshell looks. She's a lot more interesting than people assume, in large part due to the hideous marketing of the Tomb Raider series in the past. Even if your knowledge of her is only in passing, that's not an issue. I **love** introducing roleplay partners to her. They tend to be pleasantly surprised. \n\n\nBut if you're prefer something completely original, I'm flexible! I tend to build characters to fit my partner's cravings. If there's a type of character you've been writing opposite or a faceclaim you've been wanting someone to use, please let me know! I'd also love to hear about any prompts you've been itching to do but haven't been able to find anyone for. \n\nAs for me, I like urban fantasy, crime, slice of life, post-apocalyptic, and so much more. Like I said, I've been roleplaying for ages and I'd like to think I'm pretty versatile in what I can write. I'm an old lady by roleplay standards; so I'd prefer if you were over twenty-one -- not because of the content, just for my personal comfort. Also, if you see a past prompt of mine that interests you, please feel free to ask me about it! \n\n\n**What I need you to be:** \n\n- Polite\n- Able to write in 3rd person.\n- Creative.\n- Enthusiastic. \n- Available on Discord.\n- Over the age of 21.\n\n---\n\n#Also, please **don't** reach out to me via Reddit Chat. I don't read them. I only check DM's. Thanks! ~ Cheers! &lt;3",

            "selftext": "Hi there,  I would like to play out a slice of life scenario that really examines and plays around with the relationship between the characters. Here are a few ideas:\n\n\u200b\n\nA grieving couple: one of us has lost someone important to us (a parental figure perhaps) and is having a hard time coping with that. Perhaps it's changed our relationship dynamic a little, perhaps the one who used to be more of the rock in the relationship is now a bit of a mess and needs to be taken care of by the other one. Alternatively, we might have lost a child (perhaps a late miscarriage or a still birth) and could be grieving our loss.\n\n\nRomance after a loss: in this scenario, my character (F) would move to a small town after having lost her husband a few years ago. Perhaps she has a young son (2-3yo) and she never thought she's be interested in dating or another man but then she meets your character (M) and we start to slowly build up a relationship.\n\n\nMoving on after infidelity: in this scenario your character would be caught cheating on mine. Perhaps an emotional affair and this is devastating for my character who thought we were fine and just going through a bit of a slow patch. Perhaps we have been together since we were in high school/college so this is all the more devastating. Both our characters still love each other a lot and this scenario would explore how we try to move past this either staying together or after breaking up.\n\n\nIf any of these scenarios interest you or if you have an idea that is similar, send me a PM :) I usually write 2-3 paragraphs and use first person but can also use third.",

            "selftext": "Hello!\n\nThis is the first time I look for RP partners on Reddit, but here I am! I am a 25 year old woman from northern Europe, who have roleplayed since I was a young kid and have since branched out from forum RP to tabletop and live roleplay. The written format is still close to my heart though, and I put a lot of time and effort into creating characters and plots and building worlds! I try to reply at least once a day, more if my schedule allows it, and will during busy times reply at least once or twice a week.\n\nEnglish is not my first language, but I do consider myself well-versed in the language. I write around 400-2000+ words for each post, with quick-paced dialogue . While I value quality over quantity and would rather have content I can respond to than length for lengths sake, I am looking for someone who is comfortable writing within that word-count.\n\nI write any gender and is LGBT+ friendly. My characters are mostly tailored to the plot and whatever I feel like inspires me at the moment and I can easily juggle multiple characters, countless sides and a handful of mains, all with their traits and flaws. It does depend a lot on the setting and story we're going for. Romance is not a must for me and thus I don't tailor them to fit into a certain type of relationship. If the chemistry is there between the characters, I'm not against it, but other types of relationships can be fun to explore as well, whether it's platonic, familial, hate, rivalry or a mix of some or all. Multifaceted relationships are the best.\n\nI'm comfortable with most subjects and love exploring darker themes, as long as it's not glamorized OOC and there's a mutual understanding that it's called dark because it's what it is. Flawed characters are valued and I have a liking for characters I love to hate, as long as there's someone/something redeemable and the flaws are acknowledged as such. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What I am looking for:**\n\n* Mutual contribution to the plot and brainstorms.\n* Someone who likes writing and creating stories.\n* Good communication and willingness to discuss what comes next.\n* Someone who is at least 20 years of age.\n* A long-term roleplay that will go on from beginning to end.\n* Someone who is open for OOC chatter!\n* A message if you wish to take a hiatus or end the roleplay.\n* A partner who can use side-characters and NPCs. It makes the world more alive if there's more than only a handful of people.\n* The ability to separate IC from OOC.

            "selftext": "Hello and hope everyone's doing well. I came up with this plot for someone else, but since they decided to ghost me, I thought I should try Reddit! \n\nThe story follows a couple of young adults on a blind date. After the date, they find themselves stuck in a world that changes depending on their emotions. It's dark and gritty when they're scared, sad and depressing when they're feeling down and basically the Disneyland whenever they're happy or hopeful. They're stuck in the limbo and they have to figure out why as they try to find a way to get out. The possibilities are endless here and I'd love to find an enthusiastic, creative, communicative and kind writing partner! One theme that'll stay consistent throughout the limbo is a monster that's personification of their sins. I can explain it in detail in DMs or answer any questions you may have! \n\n**A little about me:** Name's Madi, AWST, 19 soon, write in third person past tense, Adv-Lit/Lit and reply once a day. This is a long-term roleplay so I'll need someone patient. I'll be happy to share a writing sample as well. OOC friendly. I only roleplay on discord.\n\n**A little about the partner I'm looking for:** Over 18, I'd prefer someone closer to AWST but it's not a necessity, be at least literate and reply once a day or two. Don't ghost!\n\nThat's all. Chat/DM if you're interested!",

You read correctly, in the year of 2021, I\u2019m still getting extremely nostalgic over star wars. \n\n\nSpecifically, the show I was lucky enough to grow up with: Clone wars!\n\nI posted a few days ago already, but although my post gained some traction, I still have room for some more new stories!\n\nI have a character ready to go, inserting his entire bio would make this post a lengthy but I\u2019ll happily provide it in pm or on discord! He is a Jedi, so there\u2019s a multitude of roles your character could fill, from his padawan or clone commander to bounty hunter or rival sith lord. Both canon characters and ocs are welcome!\n\n\n\nWhat am I looking for? Basically, just some fun space shenanigans! I\u2019d like some good ol\u2018 sci fi adventuring with plenty of room for character development.\n\n\nWhat you should know about me/some requirements:\n\n\nI\u2018m a 19yo girl from Europe (CET timezone). I\u2018m on very frequently and my posts range from semi lit to literate.\n\n\nPost length is not a huge concern for me, as long as it\u2019s above a one liner and there\u2019s some half decent grammar in there. I\u2018d like someone who\u2018s on frequently as well tho, so if you\u2019re only able to reply every few days, I\u2018m probably not the right partner for you.\n\n\nCommunication is key! It\u2018s something that is very important to me. Everything concerning planning, any issues that might arise, the plot, etc. \nI\u2019m serious. DO NOT CONTACT ME if you\u2019re just going to ghost me after two replies. It\u2019s a waste of time for everyone.\n\n\n\nI think I covered everything so far - if any of this caught your attention, I\u2018d love to hear from you! Please let me know if you\u2019re interested via pm or down in the comments :)\n\n\nMay the force be with you!",

            "selftext": "Greetings and Salutations! My name is  T and I hope everyone is safe in their corner of the world. I am 27  and have been roleplaying for a little over a decade now. I am only looking for writers of the same kind of age bracket at 22 years of age or higher.\n\n*A Few Things About Me.*\n\nThing 1. I consider myself as a literate individual with a good grasp of  the English language. I might not always get everything right but for the most part I do. I try to aim between two to three paragraphs a  reply  unless I feel the situation calls for more. In which case I will give more.\n\nThing 2. I\u2019m very detail orientated. I try my best to describe things in an  all-encompassing sort  of way and think that in doing so it brings about  a greater story.\n\nThing 3. My replies are sporadic but if I\u2019m into a story I tend to reply more.\n\nThing 4. The biggest thing for me is communication and not doing the aptly named \u201cghosting\u201d. There is nothing more annoying than starting a story, giving my time, and being ghosted. It\u2019s quite honestly the most disrespectful thing you can do to a fellow writer. If you think you might ghost or something please do not message me and save us the time.\n\nThing 5. I am interested in adult themes and content. We can talk more about what that means but that does mean within the romance between  the two characters as well. Because of that, all characters should be eighteen years of age or higher.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Note: All Characters Should Be Eighteen years of age or older*\n\nHi there! I hope this message finds you well! I hope everyone is doing well in these trying times of ours.\n\nToday, I\u2019m looking to do something involving the Matrix. Specifically, I think it might be fun to do something as a sequel to the original. Here\u2019s the idea I\u2019ve got so far\u2026\n\nThe Matrix has been rebooted and with it a new world of Machine and Human cooperation has begun. The Matrix has recompiled itself into something both similar and new. While some places remain as it, others have twisted itself as new elements are added to the code.\n\nPeople are given an opportunity to leave the Matrix now. However, some don\u2019t want to. Better to live in the simulated world then to face the harsh realities of the real one. Only those that truly believe themselves imprisoned are willing to leave the Matrix.\n\nThey\u2019re called the Enlighted ones. Those that can perceive The Matrix and can grapple with it.\n\n*\u201cThere is no spoon\u2026\u201d*\n\nIn this new world, anyone could become the one. For simply being the one is understanding that the limitations of the world are simply computer rules.\n\nRules that can be broken.\n\nA subsection of machines within the machine city have come to believe that this is wrong. The machines with the Human Machine Alliance have turned to the Humans for help with them. No one wants another Smith after all. For the first time in the history of the Matrix Agents and operatives fight together to try and route them out. Our tales would follow one such ship as it fights the rogue machines.\n\n1. Looking for female character(s) to play my male(s)\n2. Can be a one character each or multiple ones\n\nIf interested let me know!",

            "selftext": "Hello all.\n\nI'm looking for someone interested in cartoon fandoms but in which all canons are aged up and things are set in college. I like to RP via discord. I work at a slow pace so someone who is patient or has the same pace would be awesome. As these are cartoons, I would like to retain some humor and charm but I would love to inject more mature concepts and take things a little more seriously (be a bit more realistic regarding consequences, relationships and stuff). Below are concepts I have in mind, my ships are a little unusual. I am open to suggestions and multiple pairings. Please be literate and open to discussions. Nothing is worse than a partner who can't hold a conversation, be it about the RP or life in general. \n\nIf you have a show/ship you're interested in, let me know. These are just the top 5 I've got in mind.\n\n- - -\n\n**Phineas and Ferb:**\n\nPhineas, Ferb and Isabella are age 18 or 19.\n\nThe boys have gone off to college. Phineas has decided to stay local while Ferb has gone overseas. Rather than stay local as well, Isabella decides to study at the same school as Ferb. While adjusting to life in Britain, the two begin to grow closer together. While Isabella felt her crush on Phineas was one-sided, she realized Ferb might be a better match for her. She spent countless summers watching them and going on adventures, that she wondered if her feelings were misplaced with Phineas. I haven't seen all episodes but I am working on expanding my knowledge of the fandom. I am open to other characters though right now I'm digging Ferb/Isabella above all else.\n\n**Hey Arnold:**\n\nHelga, Arnold, Gerald, and Phoebe are age 18 or 19.\n\nThe gang graduates from high school to college. In this situation, Arnold and Phoebe end up growing closer together as their classes overlap with one another. Meanwhile, Gerald and Helga also begin to spend more time together. I am open to doing Helga/Arnold as a couple, and Gerald and Phoebe instead but I do think Arnold/Phoebe might be a better match. I'd love to develop these characters further, not sure I want to deal with that second movie since I found it didn't offer much to the series, sadly. I'm open to other characters aged up too. Maybe something like Herald/Rhonda? \n\n**Star vs The Forces of Evil:**\n\nStar and Marco are 18, if not 19 here.\n\nStar and Marco go to community college together. Pretty much the same premise as the other two shows, however I'd love for them to also see more of the world. We can figure out if we want to tweak the finale as it does change the presence of magic. I assume all magic is gone but the world and Mewni are somewhat merged. I'd also be fine with no magic and no Mewni as well, we'd deal with Marco and Star bonding over non-magical antics. Or we find a way to bring magic back? Generally this is a Marco/Star RP but I might be open to Tom with Jackie or Janna? Aged up of course.\n\n**American Dad/Family Guy:**\n\nFor this RP Steve is 18, Meg is 19, Snot is 18, Chris is 18 and Toshi is 18. And Haley is 22.\n\nI feel like these characters can really blend well together. I could see them all meeting in college as well or we could take them out of Langley or Quahog entirely to say the west coast? I think pairs like Steve/Meg, Snot/Meg would work. Maybe Toshi/Haley or Toshi/Meg? I'm just spit balling here but I think it could be fun.\n\n**Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius:**\n\nJimmy, Libby, Sheen and Cindy are 18. Or older.\n\nLastly, is this other classic Nick cartoon. I would imagine Jimmy/Cindy is my biggest pair but I am open to her with Sheen or Libby with Jimmy instead. I think they would continue to be friends as they navigate adulthood together. I imagine Cindy and Jimmy would still be quite smart but hopefully mellowed out some. I'd love to develop them further. Given how smart the gang is, I imagine we'd have a lot of fun.",

Anyways now that that's out of the way I'm stu (19) and want to roleplay to the best of my ability...as for story I have it set up as *you fine a small demon girl (the ways can vary) and when you talk to her you seem ok but when you are looking for work together you find that she is hiding something and you might have just made a mistake bringing her*  as for my character I'm a half demon now living as a nomad driven out of my home. on the outside I'm vary sour teasing and just being mean at times but if you can gt past that you find she is awfully caring for people she trust.

I am an experienced writer and role played a few times before, but I do admit it takes me sometime to get into the flow of things. I like building off your writing style as we slowly work together to build a story based heavily in romance, although I\u2019m open to the setting i do have a particular request for the relationship of our characters. I am also a big fan of including secondary characters as we build our little world. I please ask that you\u2019re over 18, and if any of this sounds like a good time please HMU!",

            "selftext": "\ud800\udc82 Hello there! My name\u2019s KK; it\u2019s a pleasure to meet you all! I\u2019m nineteen, and I\u2019m a novella/advanced-lit roleplayer and have been on my typing mojo for a good 7+ years of my life. Right now, I\u2019m in the mood for some good ol\u2019 Yu-Gi-Oh! roleplay \u2014 and I\u2019m talking the DM (Duel Monsters.) universe here. I don\u2019t have any specific plots in mind, but I\u2019m willing to chat with anyone and discuss what they might be eager to do  \u2014 I\u2019m open to try almost anything that is asked of me. I\u2019d prefer to have someone with writing experience, as well as knowledge of Yu-Gi-Oh! Now, for the rules...\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\u2763\ufe0e No god-modding. I've had plenty of instances where I have met people who like to control my characters and not let me have a chance to try and set up my actions. (Plus, I've heard of something called \"infomodding.\" Don't do that either. You would never know my character's powers unless discussed with me first.) \n\n\u2763\ufe0e No Mary/Gary Sues. I've run into these guys too, and it isn't much fun when one character has all the powers and controls absolutely everything. For every strength, there are weaknesses to it.\n\n\u2763\ufe0e Please don't bring me into drama! I'm not one for being involved in anything excessive, and I don't want to be dragged into it.  \n\n\u2763\ufe0e Hate the character, not the roleplayer.  \n\n\u2763\ufe0e I am sometimes busy and won't always be able to respond on the dot. I will try to answer once a day at best. If I don't respond from you in a week, I will ask you if you'd like to drop the roleplay. I'm not the kind of person who drops something out of the blue. If you don't get a response from me, do send me a message; however, don't spam me! \n\n\u2763\ufe0e I apologize, but if I ghost you and don\u2019t respond to your messages, I have possibly lost interest or have found someone else of better margin. Don\u2019t take it personally. However, that isn\u2019t to say that I won\u2019t come back and pick up the roleplay again \u2014 keep that in mind. \n\n\u2763\ufe0e Please do write dialogues and paragraphs and not one-liners! I've run into a few cases, and they weren't entertaining, I'll tell you that. Also, don't do text-talk. I am a novella roleplayer, and I typically write up to paragraphs at a time when I'm in a good mood. \n\n\u2763\ufe0e Be good with punctuation and grammar. Write in 3rd person, and be sure to write a paragraph, if not more. I do my roleplays much like how a book would portray a scene/character; again, keep that in mind. And no, I don't do script; it doesn't work for me. \n\n\u2763\ufe0e Suppose there is a push to do \"the nasty\" right away, one word: *DON'T*. I prefer chemistry over romance, and it keeps me interested in the story.\n\n\u2763\ufe0e I DOUBLE! \n\n\u2763\ufe0e Canon characters and background characters will be involved. We can both set up who will be who and go from there.\n\n\u2763\ufe0e I don't always want to be the one shedding my ideas into the spotlight. I'd love to hear the thoughts you have too! \n\n\u2763\ufe0e I will only accept a few people as I am selective, so please do take it upon yourself to present yourself accordingly and with care. (\u2022\u0300\u1d17\u2022\u0301)\u0648\n\n\u2763\ufe0e Again, don't spam me! There are some things that I cannot control, and if I don't respond immediately, just know that I take my time with replies. I like to flush out details so that way my partner can be satisfied with the result. \n\n\u2763\ufe0e I will sometimes draw art of OCs and characters when I have the time. And since this is a Yu-Gi-Oh! roleplay, when it comes to a duel\u2014 we can either write it out or battle it in the arena on Nexus. Either/or is okay with me. \n\nOther than that, that's pretty much it! Be sure to send me an example of how you write, and if you have an OC to send me their bio. If you prefer not to use an OC and just canon characters, that\u2019s fine by me. Also, let's have some fun when we roleplay! I'd love to hear any potential suggestions or ideas that you have \u2014 I roleplay on many different forms, so be sure to ask me in the DMs, and I\u2019ll list the possibilities.",
