My reply lengths can vary from a few lines to multiple paragraphs, but I try to mirror the writing style of my partner.\n\nI'm very much interested in romantic elements between our characters. Dark themes, pining and drama are good additions, too! I only ask you be 18+.\n\nThe plot I had in mind follows my character, the Princess of Alynthi as she's sent as an emissary to neighboring cities, tasked with maintaining relations between their kingdom and their allies.\n\nYour character is a warrior brought up in the mercenary guild. He climbed the ranks and caught the eye of the king, whom assigned him to be the princess' personal guard. His duty was, and still is, to protect her as well as train her so that she may be capable of protecting herself. He's entrusted with accompanying her on her travels. They've developed a friendship over the years, and perhaps a mutual attraction to one another though neither of them have dared to bring it up.\n\nWould be happy to work out details with anyone interested. Looking forward to talking with some of you!\n\n\nEdit: Hi, I'll tend to replies when I can! I was called into work both last night and this afternoon, so my free time will be scarce until the evening.",

            "selftext": "Hey everyone! How\u2019re you all doing? What I\u2019m looking for in this roleplay is a vampire role, but not a light-hearted one. I want a real dark vampire story here, showing the struggles of being a vampire and being around a vampire. I want to bring the genre back to its routes, with a Dracula vibe. Of course, we don\u2019t have to go down that route, but I want dark, gritty realism. If Twilight vampires is what you\u2019re after I\u2019m not your guy!\n\nAs for the plots, I\u2019m open as I usually am with these posts hahah. We could do something similar to actual Dracula, where for some reason a human needs to stay at (although they don\u2019t know it) a vampires residence. We could also go for a Hunter plot, which is always fun. As long as it allows for horror and darkness, I\u2019m all in!\n\nIn a partner, I don\u2019t look for much. I ask that you be fairly detailed, and respond frequent enough to not let the roleplay die quickly. Other than that, I\u2019m not too fussy!\n\nI\u2019m in GMT time zone, I can write as much as my partner requires of me and I primarily roleplay on Discord. Hope to hear from you all soon!",

Below are some ideas that are fairly bare because I want your input to have us build the world and plot together. I post about 2 paragraphs on average but focus on bringing the plot and chargers to life so it fluctuates. Please let me know if you are interested in any of the below or have other ideas. These are action/drama/relationship driven plots.\n\n&gt; ---------------------[\u00d7]\n\n**A Different Kind of Werewolf**\n\nYou live in the edge of a forest, always have. When you were a kid, wolves got you and dragged you out to have dinner, but one with green eyes saved you. As you grew up, the grey wolf with green eyes has always been close by. I would like to work out something to happen that exposes the wolf as not just a wolf.\n\n&gt; ---------------------[\u00d7]\n\n__The Farmer and The Princess__\n\nThe farmer has two young children and his wife passed. He doesn't have enough help to work his land and care for his children. His country recently took over a neighboring kingdom and the nobles of that kingdom are being assigned to labor positions or auctioned or similar (whatever you would prefer) and this causes your character to be placed on his farm. You don't know much of anything in how to make a living, do chores, or raise kids. He is unhappy to get someone he has to care for rather than the help he actually needs. Over time, the noble learns and grows and they become fond of each other.\n\n&gt; ---------------------[\u00d7]\n\n__The Ward__\n\nMy character is a young lord who has just lost his parents and has become head of the estate and family. Due to his father's debt, he has to take in your character as his ward when her family has passed. She is used to being poor and very independent. He expects her to become lady like so he can get her married off and out of his way, but as they interact her spirited ways warm his heart. We can add magical aspect to this, like maybe his family has a curse and that is why he wants her wed so quickly, but she happens to know a bit of magic and can protect herself.\n\n&gt; ---------------------[\u00d7]\n\n__The Dragon Hunter__\n\nYour character is a warrior trained from a young age to avenge her mother who was sacrificed to a dragon. She hunts them and has had many successful kills. One hunt, she is ambushed by highwaymen and left for dead. When she wakes, she is bandaged and in a cave that has been outfitted to look much like a house. A personal assistant (the dragon in disguise) tells you that his employer has done much to ensure she survived and will host her until she recovers. The one behind the scenes is a dragon and she is determined to save the man and destroy the dragon as she and the man grow close. How will she react when she finds out he is the dragon she so wants to kill?",

Now, I hear the question(s) already. \u201cBut Dren,\u201d you cry, \u201cIf you really do have the perfect roleplaying prompt, how will I, years down the road after our story is complete, ever write another story again?\u201d And to that, I give one simple answer, \u201cI don\u2019t know; you interested?\"\n\nIf you are still reading, let me let you know what you can expect from me, other than the perfect roleplaying starter. You can expect frequent, friendly out-of-character conversation. You can expect frequent, well-thought-out replies, written in the third-person past-tense, that average between three and five paragraphs. And you can expect to frequent (do you see what I did there?) deep, explorable worlds filled with deep, explorable characters.\n\nIf you like the sound of what I\u2019m *throwing down*, and you feel like you can *throw down* the same, please do not hesitate to reach out. I am more than eager to begin building off of this perfect starter with the perfect roleplaying partner.",

Im 23 based in Australia, Im roughly 14 hours ahead of the US, i dont mind the time zone difference if you dont.  \n\nALSO DISCORD ONLY!  \ni am looking for hopefully detailed, longterm and of course exciting rps! Please note im looking for DETAILED roleplayers! So if youre not able to do 2-3 paragraphs minimum in most of your responses, we arnt going to fit well.\n\nNow i will state off the bad this will be a gritty and dark prompt, and i personally am not a fan of slice of life/romance storys, this story is designed around the gritty side of things- so dont expect me to censor it.\n\nNow for the prompt itself!\n\n1- A futuristic setting of a long standing Soviet union, the hidden secret of Super soldier who blended in with society for the last 50 years until everything collapsed. With the lives of those soldiers breaking apart A place known only as South City is built, while its no red square its home to these soldiers now. You a man who has tried everything to solve a problem is given the chance to have it dealt with for you, simply by opening your wallet. -this world is set in a more 21st century setting, with changes mostly to the past, technology is very similar to what we have of course. This prompt has the ability to go various directions, with no set direction of your or my characters motives.\n\n2- A WWll setting based in German held land, While playing with the similar settings as the first prompt you will instead tackle the mystery of meeting by chance one of these Super soldiers, You yourself are given control of your own base, and make decisions that may turn the tide of war forever, it all depends on if you believe the rumors of the seemingly indestructible opposing forces on the Eastern front.\n\nSo if i have peaked your interest please Dm me to read the full prompt! Please do not comment i have the notifs turned off so i likely will not see it",

            "selftext": "Hello! Hope you\u2019re having a super Tuesday evening or Wednesday! \n\nThis is my first time posting on a thing like this in quite some time, so bear with me. I\u2019ve got an idea for a RP and it\u2019s pretty flexible in case you don\u2019t like all the mechanics of what I\u2019m about to describe. \n\nBasically, my idea is as follows: \n\nI will play a Princess of a powerful kingdom. She\u2019s the youngest in the family (so spoiled, bratty, the whole shebang). She, notably, is extremely bright, although most people don\u2019t really know that. Rumors are always that she\u2019s a bit ditzy... with a few drinks she can be a sort of liability. Maybe it\u2019s all for entertainment, maybe she\u2019s actually like that in part; I haven\u2019t decided yet. \n\nYour character would be someone from an enemy kingdom, or even a rebellious faction that\u2019s brewing from typical resentment towards overindulgent monarchies. You know the story. *Anyway,* I\u2019m thinking that your character would want to befriend mine in some way, shape, or form. Maybe they meet at a ball or on some sort of shallow philanthropy event. We can figure that out together. \n\nYour character, notably, would be trying to befriend her for information, power, a bargaining piece... some sort of gain for their cause. If they\u2019re from a rival kingdom or are a part of a rebel group, it\u2019s clear they\u2019d want to have the ditzy princess wrapped around their finger, or at least as an asset. \n\nMy character, though, would fall in love with yours, and my idea is that yours would reciprocate that. She\u2019s also smarter than she looks, so she\u2019ll start to figure things out and *yada yada yada* we\u2019re deep into a roleplay at this time. \n\nI\u2019m flexible on the details of the RP up to literally the genre. I would love to do something with royalty and rivalries, but it can be brought down to any enemies-to-lovers level. What I won\u2019t do is anything like... high school or college. I just finished college, so I don\u2019t really want to be escaping back to something I lived, if that makes sense. \n\nWhat I\u2019m looking for is hopefully you! I consider myself semi to advanced lit, basically meaning I can write anywhere from a few (3-4 paragraphs) to a novella length response in 3rd person. I usually go over the Discord character limit without issue. I\u2019d like my partner to have the same, but more importantly, I\u2019m looking for someone with attention to detail, creativity, and good grammar! I don\u2019t want to carry the whole story on my back, and I don\u2019t expect you to as well. I really want to collaborate and create a story and world together. \n\nIf this interests you at all / you sound like the right kind of partner, please message me! I may not respond right away (I\u2019m about to nod off) but I will respond with haste. \n\n*PS: Not necessary, but writing samples are a huge plus so I can easily vet through any responses to this post I receive. Can be anything that shows how you write in a RP scenario.* \n\n*PPS: Stay healthy and stay safe!*",

            "selftext": "I\u2019m looking for someone that might be interested in a relaxing, low-key slice of life style roleplay with romance and some fantasy thrown in for good measure. I\u2019m after the roleplay equivalent of snuggling under a soft blanket with a cup of hot tea, watching the snow fall outside while an apple pie bakes in the oven. At its heart, I\u2019d like a story where two people meet and fall in love in their own time.\n\nSome examples of the sort of story I\u2019m looking for are a witch/warlock taking in a knight after finding them injured after a battle, a favorite book character coming to life and hanging around, someone running a magical caf\u00e9 or tavern and another frequenting it, two people meeting on a magical college campus, two very different cultures/races having an arranged marriage to cement a treaty, a thief trying to steal an item from a compassionate mage who takes them under their wing instead of turning them in, a vampire looking for their soulmate who is reincarnated every few generations, etc... I don\u2019t have anything solid and would love to hear any ideas you might have. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be all rainbows and sunshine. There can be highs, lows, and challenges to work through. There can be some angst and drama. Maybe even a little bit of adventure as long as there\u2019s not much combat involved.\n\nI\u2019m only comfortable roleplaying in 3rd person. I prefer to use discord, but will do docs if I like the story enough. This is meant to be pretty casual so I\u2019m just looking to write a couple paragraphs or so posted whenever we feel like it. I hope this ad is appealing to someone. Please let me know your thoughts when you message me. I probably won\u2019t answer anything that\u2019s just a greeting or stating you\u2019d like to rp with no elaboration.",

As I am also very flexible, I can play Males as well as Females. \nFurthermore, I am always open for both OCs and Canons. (if we are doing a canon setting) \n\nWhile I do not require you to write a whole book, I do think you should be able to be detailed and to be able to at least write a few sentences/paragraphes but most of the time there, I'll go after my partner and how the situation is demanding it. I am mostly interested in following settings:\n\n- Game of Thrones/A song of Ice and Fire (GoT/ASOIAF): There, I have a lot of Canon knowledge and can do all sorts of settings (Children of the Forrest, Invasion of the First Men, Invasion of the Andals, Aegons Conquest, Dance of Dragon, War of the 5 Kings, the Clash of Queens, alternate lore, ...) \n- Harry Potter: Same with GoT. I have a lot of Canon knowledge here as I have read the books and watched the movies multiple times. I can also do all kinds of Harry Potter settings (Tom Riddles time at school , Foundation of Hogwarts, Golden Trio era, Marauders era, Cutsed Child era, ...)\n- Historic RP (with a historic setting) \n- RP with historic references\n- Fantasy Setting (we can talk about further details in DMs) \n- Worldbuilding (We build a World together and RP there) \n- much more other genres and suggestions I can't all list here... \n\nIf you have other suggestions, feel free to DM me and we can talk about it.\nI only RP in 3rd person so apologies to those who RP in 1st person. \n\nSend me a DM If you are interested! \n\nThank you for reading and have a nice day!",

The gentleman's sprightly, yet guttural intonation was hoarse due to the decreased timbre of advanced age, not to mention the corollary of neat, Scotland-distilled, malted barley-based whiskey perched alongside him like a constant confidant.

            "selftext": "Edit: Please don't leave a comment if you're interested! All I'm going to do is ask you to message me.\n\nMy beach town is a setting I have had for years and never done much with. Currently I have a lot of little ideas that aren't more than sparks. I *do* have a set of characters living in the town that are pretty fleshed out, 4 siblings who come from a well-known and respected family. \n\n**The Town**\n\nGoldrock, California. A small resort town in Northern Cali with a population of 6,500. It's beautiful, quaint, and slightly more isolated than a lot of California's beach towns, making it attractive to a huge variety of people. \n\n**Potential Stories and Characters**\n\n*Goldrock's got a serial killer. They strike often and randomly. It took nearly a year for the police to even piece together that it's the same person and not a strange uptick in random violent crime. The story would start sometime in the middle of this murder spree. Everyone is terrified, low on sleep, and suspicious of everyone else they see. The characters we play could be involved directly with the case (police, investigator, contracted psychological professional, victim's family, etc) or they could just be townspeople living through it. \n\n\n*After one of the most successful careers in NFL history, he's retiring and longs for something like a normal life. Goldrock felt like a good match; there's a beach, a luxury service industry, and it's not too big. Maybe here he can finally settle down.\n\n\n*It's a dream come true, even though it came with a lot of hard work. Her own bakery. Right on one of the most popular streets in Goldrock, often walked by both tourists and townsfolk to and from the beach. It was finally time to get started.\n\n\n*I don't want to get too much into the siblings here. They're longtime characters of mine that I've revamped for the Goldrock setting. \n\n\n**Non-Goldrock Stories**\n\nI've also got ideas that don't take place in Goldrock, and I'm open to hearing yours. \n\nThe Future Queen - A fictional royal family based heavily on the Windsors/British royal family for simplicity's sake. Modern-realistic/alt universe. This one has two potential story lines. In one, it follows somewhat the Diana/Charles story where a young, well-bred woman with a squeaky clean history finds herself married to the future king. He treats her poorly, has another woman whom he clearly is actually in love with, and the young woman is miserable. An affair starts up between her and her husband's younger brother, lots of fun drama ensues. The other story line would be the courting/blossoming relationship between the young woman, who is perhaps not as high-bred, and the future king who genuinely loves her and fights his family's wishes for him to marry someone more suitable to be the future queen.\n\nFandoms - I'm not out here trying to write the next great American novel through roleplay. I have no problem using existing settings and some existing characters. I love Mass Effect, Dragon Age, Skyrim, and GreedFall settings. If you're wanting a Commander Shepard-involved story, I've even got an idea combining Mass Effect with another game setting.\n\n**My Preferences**\n\n* Third person only, past or present tense is fine with me. \n* Realistic face claims required. \n* I play both genders and don't care about your IRL sex/gender. In the quips I've written above, I don't mind playing the character I've described (retired NFL player, baker) or the character paired against them. \n* I expect the stories to include romance. I don't tend to want it as the sole focus, but I love exploring romantic relationships between people.\n* Discussion about the story and characters is one of the best parts of this! I won't jump into writing without figuring out some key parts of the story first. \n* I don't ghost. I know I'm not going to be everyone's cup of tea, and not everyone is going to be mine. I have no problem letting someone know if I don't think we'll get along. In the same vein, I have no problem trashing a story/characters/aspects and trying to work something else out if I like your writing but I'm not feeling the story, so don't be afraid to let me know if that's how you're feeling. \n* I won't post every day. I write for my job, also, so sometimes I'm just burnt out. If I can tell it's going to be more than a day before I'll be able to respond, I will let you know. Sometimes I can respond multiple times in one day. \n\nAnything else can probably be figured out through discussion. I prefer to use Discord, but we can definitely message back and forth a bit here before we have to add each other if that's your preference. I can't wait to hear from anyone who's interested!",

            "selftext": "\n***The Tiger Tank is a legendary war machine. Allied guns can barely scratch the thick steel skin. Few enemies can survive the Tiger's bite, an 88mm cannon that destroys most allied tanks with a single shot. A Tiger crew would often run out of ammunition before the enemy ran out of tanks.***  \n\n\nAs the title and opening quote suggests, I am looking to do a roleplay based off the Last Tiger campaign, from Battlefield V. While the game is all-around pretty awful, The Last Tiger was excellent and felt like it came from totally different developers, the quality was astounding. And thus, I was inspired to start a roleplay similar in nature - a German Tiger crew, fighting on the Eastern Front and then all the way back to Berlin, from 1943 to 1945. It will be a long-term rp, and the main focus will be the characters and their stories. Because the roleplay is set from a German perspective, the story will include many war-crimes and will delve into the evils of the German Army. Anyone who believes in the Clean Wehrmacht myth, this is not for you. I'm looking for people who can and will acknowledge the crimes of the German Army, and not make excuses for them. This will contain heavy themes, violence, gore, and of course, things that are generally uncomfortable to disucss, i.e murder of innocent civilians. Characters will not be good people, and I would prefer if characters are written to be *bad* people. Of course, this doesn't have to be for the whole roleplay - but our characters will not be heroes, they will not be admirable.   \n\n\nIf this sounds interesting to you, message me. I'll give you my discord and we can discuss further.\n\n  \n***German Soldiers fought under an oath of unconditional obedience to their leader. Most did exactly as they were told. \"We will not capitulate - no, never! We may be destroyed, but if we are, we shall drag a world with us - a world in flames.\"***",

The main theme I like to play is romance but we can also add different elements into it if you wish. Please note though, fantasy is a big no! I would really appreciate it if you were reliable, and tell me if it got boring because then it's fair. If you ghost me, don\u2019t expect a sudden second chance. Of course we will both have our own personal lives but I\u2019ll always communicate healthily and let you know when I\u2019m busy. If you're going to message, be serious about this too and have a clear idea about what you want. I can do first or third person, I can change my preference if needs to be. \n\nHonestly, I will NOT accept one liners nor will I respond back to you if you're just gonna ghost. I've had enough of people just coming along for short-term purposes when this is LONG term. When I say long term, I\u2019ve had stories with people that have gone on for years. Please be aware of this! I cannot stress that enough. I\u2019m not putting in the effort if you don\u2019t. \n\nMy list:\n\n\\~Friends from childhood.\n\n\\~Roommates.\n\n\\~Nurse and Solider/Veteran.\n\n\\~Princess falls for the Village baker. \n\n\\~Friends with benefits.\n\n\\~Rich Entrepreneur and interior designer.\n\n\\~Gang member and innocent girl. (Sometimes I do a crossover between this idea and childhood best friends!)\n\n\\~Strangers.\n\nAnd of course, any other ideas you wish to tell me about. Yes I know these are clich\u00e8, so I\u2019m willing to spice them up and add a lot more angst, or even some dark themes if it does fit with the idea. \n\nI cannot stress this enough; Please be literate! (more than a paragraph at least). If you deliver on that, I will too. Roleplay is a two way mutual thing and it has to flow in order to keep a story going. \n\nI use Discord, Reddit and kik. I enjoy using Kik more though. Thanks for reading!",

Three years down the road, we\u2019d both graduated, and in the summer had gotten married. After placing the deposit down for our first crappy apartment, we finally began our lives.*\n\nThis is my short prompt for a Roleplay idea I\u2019ve had, which involves a newlywed couple. I\u2019d like to explore the ins and outs of a real adult relationship, issues with finances, and marriage. I love having some conflict, so I\u2019d like to sprinkle some of that in there. \n\nMy character is a wealthy-born, law school graduate. Preferably, I\u2019d like yours to be someone more middle-class, who got in on merit, rather than privilege. He\u2019s a tall, confident man who\u2019s very charismatic, and a bit callous and insensitive at times. \n\nI prefer using discord, although Reddit is also fine. I\u2019m fine with doing both first and third person. I like writing at least 4-6 sentences per response, but I\u2019m not crazy about length. I consider myself more semi-literate, as I don\u2019t like writing paragraphs on end, since I like having a Roleplay I can actually respond in. If you\u2019re interested in any way, just let me know.

            "selftext": "\nYo,\n\n\nSpectre here, taking a break from being a shadow agent protecting the galaxy, and looking for some roleplay partners. I have the need to scratch the sci-fi itch, and have two characters I\u2019d love to write; one\u2019s an old favorite, the other\u2019s newer, and I welcome the chance to flesh \u2018im out more.\n\n\nFor plot, I\u2019m looking for the Cyberpunk sub-genre. Can be set in the Cyberpunk 2077 universe, or one of our own making, but the game has me wanting to explore the genre more. I\u2019m looking for a more grounded story, with our characters getting in a mess over their heads, involving Corpos. Maybe they\u2019re merc buddies. Maybe they meet during a gig gone awry. Whatever we decide, I see a heist going south, getting betrayed by a fixer, and our characters teaming up to enact revenge, while about half the city is on their heels.\n\n\nMy characters:\n\n\n**Maverick:** A 6\u20194\u201d gunslinger and soldier to his core, Maverick has a deathwish and chip on his shoulder. Denied his warrior\u2019s death a few times in life, watching his buddies die and leave him behind, he seeks to end those who took their lives. The most dangerous enemy is the one with nothing left to lose, after all. But underneath his gruff, he has a buried heart of gold, and really takes nothing seriously. Is sarcastic and cracks jokes instead of dealing with his emotional issues. Faceclaim is Tom Hardy. \n\n\n**Akira:** A street rat taken in by the Yakuza when he was younger, along with his twin brother, Aiko, the duo were raised to be trained assassins. Good at what they did, they rose through the ranks quickly, and were often hired out by a corporation to do their dirty work. Until they became a lose end. HQ was raided, leaving their boss and adoptive father dead. In the ashes, Aiko took over, and Akira became his man on the street. Cold, calculating, Akira gets the job done, one way or another. Usually he takes the path of least resistance, which often means pulling out his blade before his enemies have a chance to react. Faceclaim is Godfrey Gao.\n\n\nAnd a little about me as a writer:\n\n* I adore detailed posts, though I also believe in quality over quantity. My average sits around 300-500 words, though I\u2019ve been known to go double that, depending on the scene and number of characters involved.\n* I can promise a few posts a week. I try for more, but it doesn\u2019t always happen. Please let me know if you need a break, and I\u2019ll do the same!\n* OOC communication is encouraged! I want to make sure we\u2019re both comfortable and having fun in the roleplay. Plus, I love sharing memes. Memes make the internet go \u2018round.\n* I enjoy romance, but characters must have chemistry. I have a preference for writing males but can also write females as side characters; pairings will depend on the sexuality of the characters involved.\n* I am over 21, and would prefer to write with others over the age of 18.\n\n\nIf you\u2019re interested, shoot me a message!",

After all it is my favourite franchise of them all, and I need my dose.As for characters and settings, I am quite open for anything, but my preferred era would be the Clone Wars era, starting from their highpoint and all the way through the rise of the empire.I would love to get to chat with you OOC as well, see who is the person behind the characters I'm playing against. Canon characters are welcome too, so long as I don't have to play any as my main character. Romance, Drama, Action, Politics, can all be included but must not be, really.\n\nIf this sparked your interest, go ahead and send me a DM or a chat request, and I'd be happy to craft something together! I am in CET, so I usually don't take anyone with more than 7 hours of time difference, because otherwise there are few common activity spans.  \nI generally only roleplay on discord, so that would be a must for you.",

I am looking for a partner (or more than one, y'know) to write out stories with me set within a few fandoms! After a hiatus to focus on current partners, I've decided to go looking once more.\n\n**FANDOMs**\n\n* Naruto / Boruto (Uzumaki Naruto)\n\nI am indeed looking for some more Naruto roleplay featuring The Best Boy. I'm particularly interested in someone willing to follow a few specific details (listed below) while being open to ideas - such as AUs. I also would prefer someone who is open to taking Naruto far more seriously than Kishimoto did. Proper characterization, addressing the *dark* stuff that went down, and so forth.\n\nIn terms of ships (canon characters)? I am particularly looking for any other character besides Sakura at the moment. This can be Hinata, Ino, Kurotsuchi, Tenten, or whoever (within certain limits!) that could be fitting. I have...tons of ideas. OCs are welcome as well - but I am particularly picky on this.\n\n* My Hero Academia (Midoriya \"Deku\" Izuku)\n\nMy Hero Academia has rising interest from me, and like the above, I am planning on writing Best Boy aka Izuku Midoriya. Generally, I am going to write him as being 16 (currently) or older - for a variety of reasons. The older aspect will more likely be the answer, but is flexible for plot!\n\nIn terms of ships - well, that can be discussed. There's Ochako, Kyoka, Momo, Nejire, and more! No real preference, and OCs are welcome but I will be picky on this one.\n\n**LOOKING FOR / DETAILS:**\n\n* Third-person perspective writing, Multi-para length\n* Discord-based roleplay\n* Willingness to play canon characters in high preference, but OCs are fine. We must talk about the OC beforehand.\n* Alternate takes/universes only!\n* Male x Female romance please!\n* Would like to talk / RP often. Even if its just plotting &amp; planning.\n\nWith that said - looking forward to any interest if this caught anyone's eyes!\n\nIf I don't respond to you immediately, please be patient with me. I must warn you that I am also particularly picky - I have standards, but I'll try my best to not let them 100% drive me.",

            "selftext": " \n\nHi      there! Natalie here, coming up with another roleplay prompt that  you     may (or may not of course) find interesting. This one will  probably  be    less ambitious compared to my other prompts in terms of   imaginative    content, but I hope you enjoy it nonetheless.\n\nThe      setting is basically a fantasy world with a medieval level of      technology and magic sprinkled in. It's not the most original of      settings, but it allows for so many options when it comes to the      worldbuilding that it is definitely my favorite setting to roleplay in      and I always try to make it at least a bit more interesting than the      typical medieval fantasy. Now I'll get into specifics and maybe you   too    will find it interesting.\n\nThe     main  places where the roleplay will be set are two kingdoms - Riste   and    Vernia. The former is quite the typical coastal kingdom in  which  the    nobility wields the majority of power and the king is a   representative    position, but the latter could hardly be called a   kingdom - it's a    massive stretch of land inhabited only by undead   creatures and masters    of necromancy that control them. For thousands   of years, Vernia grew in    power and territory, successfully cutting   off Riste from other human    kingdoms nearly 700 years ago. It would be   truly a miracle that Riste    hasn't been wiped out yet, but for some   reason the Kingdom of Undeath    stopped their conquest about five   centuries ago. However, it isn't a    reason to feel safe in Riste, as   powerful liches and necromancers often    raid villages and cities near   the border to raise new minions or  drain   souls from humans, leaving   only lifeless bodies behind. But very  rarely   the victims of such  vile  practices may survive....\n\nThis      leads us to the center of the prompt - my character, Mira. She is a      soulless, which is a term to describe a person who had their soul    either   stolen, destroyed, or they renounced it themselves and they  can   be   distinguished by their eyes - their pupils are white and the    irises are   light teal. Mira sits in the first category, as her  village   was raided   by a powerful lich who took the souls of everyone  in it.   Her survival   was truly a miracle, but she also found herself  in a   difficult situation   - the soulless are feared by the people of  Riste,   and Mira knew she   would never get her old life back if she  didn't do   something, so she   decided to act. Driven by determination  and a  desire  to avenge her   family and friends, she swore that she  would  slay the  lich and try to   get her own soul back. But there is a  slight  problem  though - she isn't   exactly a figher. The road to  becoming a  powerful  warrior is difficult   and long, so having a  companion at her  side would  be greatly  beneficial.  But who would  even decide to help  someone who  is shunned by  society  with a goal  that may not even be  reachable?\n\nThat's     where your  own character comes in. They will become Mira's  companion,    and the  roleplay will probably start off with their first  ever  meeting.   My  only requirements for them is being about 20 years  old (as  this is    the age of my own character) and generally  inexperienced, but  willing   to  become an adventurer or anyone of the  same sort. Other  than that it   is  fair game, and you can do whatever  you want with them.  I'm very   LGBTQ+  friendly, so you can totally  expect me to accept any   transgender  or  non-binary characters. I'll  probably assume the role of   a GM, but  don't  be discouraged by that -  you can still give your own   suggestions  in  terms of plotlines  associated with your character.   Speaking of that,  I'd  like you to  include the character's backstory as   well as their  looks.  It will  help me judge them to see if they fit   into the plot I  set up. In   terms of visual references, you can add   them if you want to  but  they're  not mandatory, as I don't really care   about them.\n\nAs    the roleplay   progresses you'll find out more about Mira and the  world   she's in, but   I'll drop a few more tidbits that may or may not  help you   with your   character and give you a better understanding of  the world:\n\n\\-     Because of  Riste's isolation from the other human countries, it has     developed a  great network of sea trade. Right now it has become a  titan    in this  field, having a powerful fleet and tens of thousands of     mariners.  Almost all of it's major cities are located near the  coast,    along  with its capital - Durrock. The climate resembles that  of     Mediterranean countries, becoming more and more temperate the  further     inland you go. This environment is also perfect for different  animals     considered monsters to call it their home.\n\n\\-      Earlier I mentioned that soulless are feared by Riste's  inhabitants,     but I didn't really explain why. Well, it all comes  down to the  magic    system. The basic way that humans can use magic is  by the use  of  magical   tattoos, which when engraved upon the user's  arms allow  them  to  channel  energy and unleash it as fire, wind,  water, earth  etc. The   tattoos work  only if they are placed on the  user's arms, so  mages have   developed  their own small culture around  them. The best  mages usually   wear  sleeveless robes, showing their  impressive  markings to everyone   around  them to show that they are  not afraid of  revealing their power   and that  they can take on anyone  that dares to  challenge them. For   contrast,  magic users that become  mercenaries or  bandits always wear   longs sleeves  to hide their  abilities to have an  edge in a fight. The   only type of  magic that is  different from the  others is death magic -   the use of  necromancy  and manipulation of  life. Only the soulless can   use it, and  it is  the exact reason why  the populus fears them, as even   those who  have  become soulless  unwillingly often resort to becoming   necromancers   for a variety of  reasons.\n\nIf    you  have any more  questions about Riste, Vernia or any other aspect   of  the  world then  be sure to mention it in your opening message!\n\nNow         I'll have a few requirements  and rules for you. They are not  too        strict, but you have to  acknowledge them before messaging  me:\n\n1. Be          between 18 and 26 years old. I'm 19 and I only feel comfortable      with     people who are of similar age, so this one is a must. I  know     that   there   are a ton of great writers who are older, but it  just     doesn't   work for   me, sorry.\n2. Be          literate. I'm by no means a great writer, but even I have   certain        standards. 2-3 paragraphs per response is a must, and I   expect  even    more    if there is a lot of things going on. I'm of   course  going to    follow    that rule, and even surpass it as I often   catch  myself  writing   a lot    more than it is required. Proper   english  grammar is  also   something you    need to have. I'm not a   native  speaker of  english and   everyone makes    mistakes, but I try   to make  my posts and  rp responses   clear and    understandable.\n\nI       hope   you read through those requirements, which is definitely        necessary if   we're going to try and write something together. If  you     did, then include the word \"pong\" in either the title, or  anywhere  else    in your opening message. It will show me if you've  read my  prompt    thoroughly.\n\nRight   now,    I'm    trying to think of anything that I wanted to say   before I post     this,    and I don't think there's anything to add  here.  If you  have any       questions then be sure to include them in  your  message,  and I hope you       stay safe and have a wonderful day!",

I'm looking for someone who is casual, considerate, and doesn't mind some OOC chatter! (also yes I have made a post before)\n\nAs the title suggests this is solely for Kingdom Hearts as I've been a long time fan of the series despite how utterly confusing it is sometimes.\n\nRegarding Kingdom Hearts I'm well versed in the series including the mobile game Union Cross (I haven't really been keeping up with Dark Road tho). Ideally I would love to throw in a couple OCs to bring something new to the table and play around around with the plot. I'm very comfortable playing the canon characters of the series and will play as many as I need to in order to get the story going. Ideally I would love to do oc x canon  pairings and I most definitely prefer to double that way you are involved with the story as much as I and you get something you like out of it as well.\n\nSpecifically, I'm looking for someone who is comfortable playing Axel/Lea against my OC and in turn I'll happily play whoever you like for your pairing. I do like to create plots that suit both of our characters and I'm alright with doing pre or post KH3 depending on your preferences.\n\nNow that the fun stuff is out of the way\\~\n\nI do prefer to rp over discord or gdocs, I don't mind which we go with! As for posting frequency I would ideally like someone who is comfortable with at bare minimum 1 post a week. If you can post more frequently than that, cool! If not, also cool! I do prefer my partner to be over the age of twenty as well. \n\nThank you for reading this far!",

Don\u2019t take it personally. However, that isn\u2019t to say that I won\u2019t come back and pick up the roleplay again \u2014 keep that in mind. \n\n\u2763\ufe0e Please do write dialogues and paragraphs and not one-liners! I've run into a few cases, and they weren't entertaining, I'll tell you that. Also, don't do text-talk. I am a novella roleplayer, and I typically write up to paragraphs at a time when I'm in a good mood. \n\n\u2763\ufe0e Be good with punctuation and grammar. Write in 3rd person, and be sure to write a paragraph, if not more. I do my roleplays much like how a book would portray a scene/character; again, keep that in mind. And no, I don't do script; it doesn't work for me. \n\n\u2763\ufe0e Suppose there is a push to do \"the nasty\" right away, one word: *DON'T*. I prefer chemistry over romance, and it keeps me interested in the story.\n\n\u2763\ufe0e I DOUBLE! \n\n\u2763\ufe0e Canon characters and background characters will be involved. We can both set up who will be who and go from there.\n\n\u2763\ufe0e I don't always want to be the one shedding my ideas into the spotlight. I'd love to hear the thoughts you have too! \n\n\u2763\ufe0e I will only accept a few people as I am selective, so please do take it upon yourself to present yourself accordingly and with care. (\u2022\u0300\u1d17\u2022\u0301)\u0648\n\n\u2763\ufe0e Again, don't spam me! There are some things that I cannot control, and if I don't respond immediately, just know that I take my time with replies. I like to flush out details so that way my partner can be satisfied with the result. \n\n\u2763\ufe0e I will sometimes draw art of OCs and characters when I have the time. And since this is a Yu-Gi-Oh! roleplay, when it comes to a duel\u2014 we can either write it out or battle it in the arena on Nexus. Either/or is okay with me. \n\nOther than that, that's pretty much it! Be sure to send me an example of how you write, and if you have an OC to send me their bio. If you prefer not to use an OC and just canon characters, that\u2019s fine by me. Also, let's have some fun when we roleplay! I'd love to hear any potential suggestions or ideas that you have \u2014 I roleplay on many different forms, so be sure to ask me in the DMs, and I\u2019ll list the possibilities.",

It has been a desire of me for a long time, to be able to enjoy roleplay in a proper, detailed and well-rounded world, where my actions have consequences, both positive and negative and where anything, or rather, anything logical within the confines of the world being presented, could happen.\n\nAm I too confusing? Too rambly? Perhaps, although I still believe some of you might understand what I mean. As for the details, I don't care too much about the specifics, it might be sci-fi, Fantasy (I mostly like low and dark fantasy, but I could be convinced...) or even Historical settings! (In fact, I would love to do a historical setting! Or at least something closely inspired! The thought of playing a Viking captain sailing away to explore, raid, plunder and possibly conquer new lands excites me!).\n\nI am open to playing more or less anything and anyone, Male, Female, Human, non-human, any profession or backstory Viking captain? An agent working for a mysterious secret organization? A simple soldier? Peasant? Noble? I was in-fact partially thinking of doing this as a sort of life of my character'. Where we start with them at a relatively young age, go through their formative experiences (through time-jumps probably) and quite possibly even towards their death! I would prefer if my character did not die randomly in the heat of battle, or something akin to that, but it could be discussed, anything else gruesome or dark that might happen to them, is fair game!\n\nIf this sounds at all interesting to you! Feel free to DM me your pitch and preferably your Discord! Not everything about the world has to be set in stone, as long as there is something to built off from. If we choose to do a historical setting, it would be nice if you knew a lot about the time and place! I'm looking forward to hearing from ya!",

I am able to play:  Tifa, Cloud and some others for the plot but I am searching for  Sephiroth mostly. For the plot, if you want, I don't mind if you have an  OC in mind but we can talk about what we can do with an OC of yours in  reddit chat.\n\nI do want some weird  shipping, but I also would not mind if Sephiroth was a toxic person too  or somewhere inbetween.  I have been dying to get back into my old  character, and I don't mind picking up other characters to move the story along.\n\nIt would be FF7r or OG from Sephiroth's perspective.  I am more keen for FF7r, just for unknown funsies.  I also love romance.\n\nThe  character I play is something along the lines of a Jenova backup,  something Shinra could harvest living cells from in case Jenova died.  What I am looking for as far as a partner goes:\n\n* Cool talking OOC\n* Knows FF7 enough to plot it.\n* Can range between a paragraph to 6 para sometimes.\n* 3rd person POV\n* Discord only\n* Be 21+",

            "selftext": "Hi there! Thank you for looking at this message!\n\nI have always wanted to play with someone who can play as multiple characters. Personally, I only really feel comfortable with playing one, but I would love to interact with multiple interesting figures. I am gay (maleXmale) and I would like some romance in this rp, so you would have to be okay with that.  I want all characters and participants to be 18+.\n\nI have three main ideas which I would love to play in. However, if you're a gay gm and have another idea for roles, you can still message me to see if I'm interested (I probably will be!).\n\n**Idea 1 - MCU2**\n\nI was thinking it would be really cool if we played a kind of alternate version of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I want us to have fun with this! We would not have to use the actors from the movies (though we can if you really want that) and we could do stuff like: I play a version of Spiderman who joins our own version of the avengers. Maybe we gender bend some characters, Scarlet Warlock or Iron Woman or whatever, or we create our own heroes in the Marvel Universe!\n\n**Idea 2 - All Boys School**\n\nFor this I would like a kind of dark academia kind of aesthetic for an all boys boarding school. I would love there to be a lot of drama and maybe also some darker mysterious elements (maybe the school has some dark secret). We can also add magic to this, making it a kind of all-boys version of Hogwarts.\n\n**Idea 3 - Greek Mythology**\n\nHere, I would play a new original Greek Hero who goes on an adventure. Maybe I have to fight in great wars, outsmart scary monsters and other heroes. Maybe I go on a quest or maybe the Gods have other plans for me.",

            "selftext": "\n\nI am looking for someone that knows how to play proactively rather than just reactively. Let's write this together. Below are some ideas that are fairly bare because I want your input to have us build the world and plot together. I post about 2 paragraphs on average but focus on bringing the plot and chargers to life so it fluctuates. Please let me know if you are interested in any of the below or have other ideas. These are action/drama/relationship driven plots.\n\n&gt; ---------------------[\u00d7]\n\n**A Different Kind of Werewolf**\n\nYou live in the edge of a forest, always have. When you were a kid, wolves got you and dragged you out to have dinner, but one with green eyes saved you. As you grew up, the grey wolf with green eyes has always been close by. I would like to work out something to happen that exposes the wolf as not just a wolf.\n\n&gt; ---------------------[\u00d7]\n\n**Quiet Love**\n\nThis one is kind of close to me as I am a mute and would like to play a mute. My character is a musical savant in a steam-punk setting. He is commissioned by your character's father to compose specific music as aristocrats love to be popular for the art they commission. The lovely heiress to this noble family is pressured to be great in so many social ways but really hates the lot of it all. She enjoys the pianist's quiet company. I don't have a main storyline for this all thought out yet. I would like for there to be some kind of big turmoil that causes the girl to have to choose between her family and what is right. I hope you might have some ideas.\n\n&gt; ---------------------[\u00d7]\n\n**Marriage of the Sun and Moon**\n\nThe sun and moon are the most powerful gods in this world. Each element has a high prisest/ess that is chosen to be a vestle for the voice of it's god. The sun, a hot headed man, has chosen a lovely young girl. The moon, a vindictive woman, has chosen a quiet man. As is tradition, the priests of the sun and moon marry for the stability of the heavens, though it is well known that the two gods hate each other for some kind of slight that happened thousands of years ago. Normally the vestles are equally hostile to each other as the gods would be themselves, but this time the two seem very kind to each other... is love blossoming?",

            "selftext": "Hello all, as the title says I'm looking for someone to rp with. I do have a plot that I would like to use but any ideas you may have would be great to here. Just so everyone knows I am not 18+  so there will be no romance or the dirty dirty, just good old action rp as friends and such.\n\nI consider myself a rather literate writer and do about a paragraph each response but it also varies on the situation. So if you are interested it be great to here from you.\n\n(Here's the plot idea if you like to read it)\n\nThe Kingdom of Mersault a beautiful place,to come and trade to explore but it wasn't always like this. Hundreds of years ago the land in which this kingdom resided' s went through a bloody and ruthless war with the humans. It lasted a long and dark twenty years,these awful humans who attacked this land had tamed ferocious dragons; they used these beasts to destroy those who only wished to build a peaceful Kingdom. But not all hope was lost for the snow elves came down from there snowy mountains to aid the creatures who were fighting for their land. In the first half of the war the creatures were winning,but it all changed when a dark magician wiped out the snow elves sending them to extinction, the humans invaded this now small kingdom capturing and slaving these creatures forcing them to build a giant kingdom with walls that could not be easily destroyed. After the long five year journey of building the kingdom had ended, the humans thought the war was over,but the creatures thought differently. They plotted for three whole years and when the time was right they poissend the food for the dragon's making them unable to attack, the creatures attacked the unsuspecting humans killing them and driving them out. The humans that survived tried to take the kingdom back but did not succeed as the creatures built nearly indestructible walls. The humans tried for two more years until the creatures attempted to strike a truce, the humans accepted and left, leaving the Kingdom to go back to its peaceful roots. The Kingdom is ruled over by Louis Courtmanche, the third of his line. Now\u00a0\n\nThe Kingdom of Mersault Occupying the south of the land welcomes all creatures and beasts, even humans as long as they remain peaceful.\n\n(I'd like to build from this,hope you liked it. Bye)",

            "selftext": "Greetings! I am starting up a venture back into to the realm of medieval fantasy (one of my favorite genres) \n\nWhile this world will be based off tropes and races commonly found in the Dungeons and dragons game... it will not have the rules or lore of that game. Just giving you an idea of what type of world is all.\n\nI\u2019m a female looking for for any gender partner, so long as you are semi literate and can bring ideas to the table for story. This will have a heavy leaning on romance (as I love...well, love) but a focus on action and as adventure too. I have 3 main characters I play, all with different personalities and backgrounds, so we should be able to find someone who fits your character!\n\nHere\u2019s a short overview of your potential adventurer girlfriend.\n\n1. Kadlin- elf barbarian- trusting, naive, friendly, stubborn, kinda dumb... but in an endearing way\n\n2. Toma- elf vampire necromancer- guarded and shy, can be intense, craves affection... but don\u2019t touch me! \n\n3. Scout- gnome bard/ rogue- drunk and a bit obnoxious, flirty, will steal your heart...and your wallet. Craves adventure, not as brave as she fronts \n\nI hope that gives you enough to go on. I have full back stories available to go deeper along with character reference pictures. If you would like to adventure with me, please give a brief overview like I did on your character and I\u2019ll pick a character who I think will complement them. I only use Kik... so keep that in mind and may only get a few responses in a day...when I\u2019m real busy. But I promise I\u2019ll try to be as consistent as possible.",

            "selftext": "Hiya! I am searching for anyone that is willing to brainstorm and/or talk with me about prompts! I am perfectly okay with playing both male and female. Just ask, I am \"fluent\" in both. As for prompts and what-not, I do not have any ideas of my own at the moment, but I am quick to come up with things so it won't take me that long! That being said, I prefer that you write at least a paragraph per reply (4-7 sentences, at least). I will list any fandoms, loose prompts, platforms, and whatever else below if you are interested!\n\nI will say I am **very** picky about my partners. You have to be able to work around my schedule because I am **always** going to be willing to work around yours. Sorry if I come off rude too. I'm very friendly qnd always willing to lend an ear if needed. I just have high expectations for my partners. If we don't click I will probably tell you. Don't mean to scare anyone off, but at the same time I do! :D\n\nFandoms:\n\nStar Wars :: I've never gotten a Star Wars RP to last more than a \"scene\" so if you are interested in Star Wars please keep me interested as well!\n\nHarry Potter :: Same as Star Wars\n\nMy Hero Academia :: I've only tried this once and I got ghosted. But I love MHA I am not fully up to date on the episodes because of my busy schedule but I am working on it!!\n\nNaruto :: Same as Star Wars/Harry Potter. I LOVE naruto, but I very much dislike boruto. Sorry....\n\nCriminal Minds/Detective :: I love gritty crime shows and would absolutely die to \"star\" in one! Maybe you're the killer but also helping the investigation somehow? Get creative with this one!!\n\nBeyond Two Souls/Detroit Become Human :: I put these together because I adore Quantum Dream games! If you can come up with a prompt in these universes/futuristic/supernatural I will probably be down for it!!\n\nAssassins Creed :: I've never dabble in an Assassins Creed RP before. I am a long time fan, I dont know **everything** about the series, but I am fairly up to date with it (I've finished Valhalla)\n\nGenres: \n\nMedival Times/Historical\n\nSpace Exploration :: Star Wars, smugglers, crash landing on alien planet, ect.\n\nSlice of life (Roommates, School, etc.) \n\nFuturistic Slice of life\n\nSuper Heros :: DC, Marvel, MHA, etc.\n\nPirates/Criminals: Pirates (Historical), Mafia, Street Gangs, Detectives, Police, FBI, ec5.\n\nFantasy/Apocalyptic Adventure :: Fallout, Skyrim, ect.\n\nSo now that you know my interests, I hope you are interested in messaging me! I only RP with OC's, but if you can convince me to try a canon character I will try my best to play them. Like I previously stated, I am very easy going and easy to get along with. But like everyone I have standards and want to make sure I am finding rp partners that go beyond the minimum requirements. I want us to be able to have a conversation about irl stuff and get along. It helps with the rp, trust me! So if you are brave enough to message me, get to know me as well!!\n\nAnyway! My platforms are mostly Discord and Kik! Shoot me a pm amd let me know if you are intersted! Toodles!!",

            "selftext": "Recently the idea of zombies popped up in my head. However, I wanted to make it a little unique. Here's my idea:\n\n**The roleplay has two options. It can begin just before the apocalypse, or shortly after it has already started. It's your choice on where this RP begins. The idea is for us to play out the early stages of the zombie apocalypse and develop our characters throughout the span of a long term roleplay.**\n\n**The zombies will be slow, similar to The Walking Dead. If you're a fan of The Walking Dead, we can even use their world and rules for zombies in this RP--although I'll admit I don't know all of the lore surrounding the fandom.**\n\n**Now--the twist. The twist is that an extremely small percentage of humans bit by a zombie will be immune and won't turn. Not only will they not turn, but they'll develop a unique ability--a power. On top of that, the person that was bit would have had to survive the encounter in the first place. So.. you can see why there won't be many survivors with powers roaming the world.**  \n\n\nThere it is! Nothing too out of the ordinary, but I definitely believe it has potential. Now to list what I'm looking for in partner:\n\n* Literate.\n* Capable of responding with two paragraphs per reply, minimum. Sometimes a single paragraph is perfectly acceptable! \n* Third person.\n* Daily/frequent response rate. Obviously life happens and I'm alright with the RP being put on hold to prioritize whatever else is happening. \n* Friendly OOC chatter! This roleplay WILL be **long term**, so I'd like to form a bond with my partner.\n* Creative/Passionate! Be able to flesh out a character with relative detail.   \n\n\nThanks for reading, everyone. I hope to hear from you all soon!",

Currently out of work, so I have a good bit of free time while I hunt for a new one! I don't have any particular ideas, right now. If you do, I\u2019d love to hear them! I love a good fantasy setting, historical setting, sci-fi, but I'm open to collaborating. Having a craving for something dark, maybe with vampires, or werewolves, demons, dragons, merfolk. or magic. You get the gist, I like mythical beings. If that\u2019s not your cup of tea, please still message me! \n\nI\u2019m just usually NOT into Slice of Life, modern settings, or Fandoms.\n\nA little about me. I'm 27 (so please be around my age. I can't be doing this with an 18 year old, sorry, be at least close to my age?) I've been role-playing on and off since I was about 14, so this isn't anything new. I currently have one role play partner on discord, which I've been writing with since the beginning. The stories are always fun, but they're not testing my writing abilities anymore. I'm on EST. Reply length doesn't really matter to me, the longer the better, of course, but it's quality over quantity. I don't really have any limits when it comes to quantity. I typically play female character, but I'm open to playing both, and am willing to play multiple characters as needed.\n\nAs I said, I don't have any specific ideas in mind, I'd love to hear anything! I can also work with you to come up with an idea, if you have none and I like our vibe. Oh! Also, I don't want this to be just business. I'd like to also make a new friend, and occasionally have conversations outside the story. If that's cool with you?\n\nWell, I think that's everything! If you're still here, and are still interested, please shoot me a message, maybe start off with a joke! Give me a bit about you? I look forward to meeting you!",

If anything in that setting strikes your fancy, sweet.

Somedays, that number is zero.\n* In Discord, my posts tend to hit the character limit, given a chance, so if you want me to do something different, let me know.\n* Most of my writing is in the past tense, third-person view, but I like to experiment and mix it up depending on story and character.\n* I'm in my thirties, so please make sure you're at least an adult. It's weird roleplaying with teenagers.\n* I prefer fading to black, but don't mind cursing, gore, or anything of that nature.\n* When it comes to romance, I can take it or leave it. Platonic relationships are cool, too.\n* Some of my characters are lgbtq+ in various ways. If you\u2019re not comfortable with this...

            "selftext": "Two years' ago, I came back to our village after an absence of five years. People had assumed that I'd gone to college and forgotten about everyone, made a new life. Well, apparently not. I'd made some money, gained some life experience, become more muscular and spoke about half a dozen languages.\n\nAt that time, your sister had just got married, was expecting her first baby and you were desperate for a guy, even as you were building your career. \n\nA few weeks after my return, we were introduced at a party and became close friends and after a few dates, we were in love. As the months passed, you knew better than to bring up my missing years. It was something we glossed over.\n\nOur wedding was small and romantic and there were some figures from my past who came. Not bad people, just slightly different from our small town friends and family. We'd spent months planning our honeymoon in Europe and things were perfect. Well, fairly perfect. About a week before the wedding, you had some symptoms, the first indications that you would be a mother. \n\nAnd that's where we pick up. Our honeymoon about to start, a baby possibly on the way. I'm torn between a wholesome, standard slice of life and some intrusion from my past. I love the relaxed, atmosphere of our home but maybe something comes up from past to disturb that. We'll get through it, it'll be fun, there'll be lots of cute romance.\n\nI hope you like my idea. Please reply with more than a line. I play in Discord",

I often even like multi-character-rps but if you aren't comfortable playing more than one character and no and then a side character, that's absolutly okay. \n\n\nThe plots. I'm pretty open for a lot of plots as I haven't rp in a while (took a break because life). I like OC, but characters out of a fandom we both like would be fine too (Harry Potter, lord of the rings, dexter, ...). I'm into dark rp with crime and adventures but like sappy romantic ones too. Do you have ideas you always wanted to rp?",

The residents live fulfilling yet boring lives, mostly going about the normal business of life. The occasional travelers comes through to stay the night at the Inn or have a meal, but the town doesn't see much excitement. Until recently. \n\nA series of strange events have unfolded, throwing the village into chaos and fear. The visitors have almost fully stopped coming, scared by news of the danger they might encounter. The citizens are on edge, worried about their own safety and the economic prospects of the village. \n\n\nA few members of the village have tried their hand at finding the source of the\u00a0 issues and rooting it out, with little success. Eventually, they decide that it might be time to bring in someone else in to solve the problem. \n\nThat's where you come in. The legends of your prowess in dispatching any number of malicious entities is well known throughout the world. Your name strikes fear into the hearts of anyone who would dare face you. And you've been picked as the person to help rid Elderholme of the unknown scourge that threatens it. They partner you up with a young sorcerer named Akmesh from the village to show you around and assist in your hunt. But when the two of you finally stumble upon the creature, you may discover that this issue goes deeper than either of you could have ever expected... \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nHello! I hope you're doing well, and thanks for reading my prompt. I am a 22-year-old guy looking for a woman to play the renowned warrior to my wizard Akmesh as the two of them go forth on an adventure to stop evil forces that are causing misfortune all over the land. \n\nWhat kind of monster is it, and what is it doing? We can figure that out together! \n\nI'm hoping for there to be romance between the two characters, but it's fine if you don't want to include it! At the end of the day, I'm just interested in having a fun story. \n\nI'm around most of the day to reply and I prefer to write in 3rd person on Discord. I'm not stingy about post length. Nothing super short though. If you have any questions, please let me know!",

            "selftext": " \n\nHi     there! Natalie here, coming up with another roleplay prompt that you     may (or may not of course) find interesting. This one will probably  be    less ambitious compared to my other prompts in terms of  imaginative    content, but I hope you enjoy it nonetheless.\n\nThe     setting is basically a fantasy world with a medieval level of     technology and magic sprinkled in. It's not the most original of     settings, but it allows for so many options when it comes to the     worldbuilding that it is definitely my favorite setting to roleplay in     and I always try to make it at least a bit more interesting than the     typical medieval fantasy. Now I'll get into specifics and maybe you  too    will find it interesting.\n\nThe    main  places where the roleplay will be set are two kingdoms - Riste  and    Vernia. The former is quite the typical coastal kingdom in which  the    nobility wields the majority of power and the king is a  representative    position, but the latter could hardly be called a  kingdom - it's a    massive stretch of land inhabited only by undead  creatures and masters    of necromancy that control them. For thousands  of years, Vernia grew in    power and territory, successfully cutting  off Riste from other human    kingdoms nearly 700 years ago. It would be  truly a miracle that Riste    hasn't been wiped out yet, but for some  reason the Kingdom of Undeath    stopped their conquest about five  centuries ago. However, it isn't a    reason to feel safe in Riste, as  powerful liches and necromancers often    raid villages and cities near  the border to raise new minions or  drain   souls from humans, leaving  only lifeless bodies behind. But very  rarely   the victims of such vile  practices may survive....\n\nThis     leads us to the center of the prompt - my character, Mira. She is a     soulless, which is a term to describe a person who had their soul   either   stolen, destroyed, or they renounced it themselves and they can   be   distinguished by their eyes - their pupils are white and the   irises are   light teal. Mira sits in the first category, as her village   was raided   by a powerful lich who took the souls of everyone in it.   Her survival   was truly a miracle, but she also found herself in a   difficult situation   - the soulless are feared by the people of Riste,   and Mira knew she   would never get her old life back if she didn't do   something, so she   decided to act. Driven by determination and a  desire  to avenge her   family and friends, she swore that she would  slay the  lich and try to   get her own soul back. But there is a slight  problem  though - she isn't   exactly a figher. The road to becoming a  powerful  warrior is difficult   and long, so having a companion at her  side would  be greatly  beneficial.  But who would even decide to help  someone who  is shunned by  society  with a goal that may not even be  reachable?\n\nThat's    where your  own character comes in. They will become Mira's companion,    and the  roleplay will probably start off with their first ever  meeting.   My  only requirements for them is being about 20 years old (as  this is    the age of my own character) and generally inexperienced, but  willing   to  become an adventurer or anyone of the same sort. Other  than that it   is  fair game, and you can do whatever you want with them.  I'm very   LGBTQ+  friendly, so you can totally expect me to accept any   transgender  or  non-binary characters. I'll probably assume the role of   a GM, but  don't  be discouraged by that - you can still give your own   suggestions  in  terms of plotlines associated with your character.   Speaking of that,  I'd  like you to include the character's backstory as   well as their  looks.  It will help me judge them to see if they fit   into the plot I  set up. In  terms of visual references, you can add   them if you want to  but they're  not mandatory, as I don't really care   about them.\n\nAs   the roleplay   progresses you'll find out more about Mira and the world   she's in, but   I'll drop a few more tidbits that may or may not help you   with your   character and give you a better understanding of the world:\n\n\\-     Because of Riste's isolation from the other human countries, it has     developed a great network of sea trade. Right now it has become a  titan    in this field, having a powerful fleet and tens of thousands of     mariners. Almost all of it's major cities are located near the  coast,    along with its capital - Durrock. The climate resembles that  of    Mediterranean countries, becoming more and more temperate the  further    inland you go. This environment is also perfect for different  animals    considered monsters to call it their home.\n\n\\-     Earlier I mentioned that soulless are feared by Riste's inhabitants,     but I didn't really explain why. Well, it all comes down to the  magic    system. The basic way that humans can use magic is by the use  of  magical   tattoos, which when engraved upon the user's arms allow  them  to  channel  energy and unleash it as fire, wind, water, earth  etc. The   tattoos work  only if they are placed on the user's arms, so  mages have   developed  their own small culture around them. The best  mages usually   wear  sleeveless robes, showing their impressive  markings to everyone   around  them to show that they are not afraid of  revealing their power   and that  they can take on anyone that dares to  challenge them. For   contrast,  magic users that become mercenaries or  bandits always wear   longs sleeves  to hide their abilities to have an  edge in a fight. The   only type of  magic that is different from the  others is death magic -   the use of  necromancy and manipulation of  life. Only the soulless can   use it, and  it is the exact reason why  the populus fears them, as even   those who  have become soulless  unwillingly often resort to becoming   necromancers  for a variety of  reasons.\n\nIf   you  have any more  questions about Riste, Vernia or any other aspect  of  the  world then  be sure to mention it in your opening message!\n\nNow        I'll have a few requirements  and rules for you. They are not too        strict, but you have to  acknowledge them before messaging me:\n\n1. Be         between 18 and 26 years old. I'm 19 and I only feel comfortable     with     people who are of similar age, so this one is a must. I know     that   there   are a ton of great writers who are older, but it just     doesn't   work for   me, sorry.\n2. Be         literate. I'm by no means a great writer, but even I have  certain        standards. 2-3 paragraphs per response is a must, and I  expect  even    more    if there is a lot of things going on. I'm of  course  going to    follow    that rule, and even surpass it as I often  catch  myself  writing   a lot    more than it is required. Proper  english  grammar is  also   something you    need to have. I'm not a  native  speaker of  english and   everyone makes    mistakes, but I try  to make  my posts and  rp responses   clear and    understandable.\n\nI      hope   you read through those requirements, which is definitely       necessary if   we're going to try and write something together. If you     did, then include the word \"pong\" in either the title, or anywhere  else    in your opening message. It will show me if you've read my  prompt    thoroughly.\n\nRight  now,    I'm    trying to think of anything that I wanted to say  before I post     this,    and I don't think there's anything to add here.  If you  have any       questions then be sure to include them in your  message,  and I hope you       stay safe and have a wonderful day!",

I like to have characters that are cute together (mostly through chemistry) and elements of comedy and drama to be added in, too. The focus should be romance &amp; detail, though!\n\nIn terms of composition, I\u2019m a fan of longer messages (typically upwards of 4,000 characters, which is way, way easier on Discord) and I like to approach role plays as though writing a collaborative novella.\n\nI have both Kik and Discord, but I prefer the latter because it\u2019s so much easier to get good replies in!",

While I do like softer, sweeter scenes as well, twisted relationships will always manage to hold my attention. \n\n**My main character** \n\nMinao is a young demon roaming earth and feeding on humans. While his powers are not yet fully developed, he is fairly strong already and has the good looks to match it. His personality however could use some adjustments. Minao is hot-headed, proud, cruel and wary of strangers. For more information about this character, check the link provided in my profile. \n\n**Plot idea**\n\nIn a world where fantastical beings have been identified but generally keep to themselves, underground fighting rings that pit such creatures against each other are prospering. These fighting rings are often owned by the Mafia, known to bring both the richest and the very worst people a city has to offer together and rarely ever pursued by law enforcement. \nMinao is one of the creatures captured and forced to maul one another in the arena for the simple purpose of entertaining a jeering crowd. But his temperament is causing problems, incidents of employees being wounded a daily occurence and the fighting ring's owners are fed up with his insubordination. \n\nYour character could be a member of the Mafia, a trainer assigned the task of taming Minao, a rich collector of magical beings who purchases the demon, an uninvolved party freeing him for their own sinister reasons,.... \n\nOpen for ideas. \u2661",

Three years down the road, we\u2019d both graduated, and in the summer had gotten married. After placing the deposit down for our first crappy apartment, we finally began our lives.*\n\nThis is my short prompt for a Roleplay idea I\u2019ve had, which involves a newlywed couple. I\u2019d like to explore the ins and outs of a real adult relationship, issues with finances, and marriage. I love having some conflict, so I\u2019d like to sprinkle some of that in there. \n\nMy character is a wealthy-born, law school graduate. Preferably, I\u2019d like yours to be someone more middle-class, who got in on merit, rather than privilege. He\u2019s a tall, confident man who\u2019s very charismatic, and a bit callous and insensitive at times. \n\nI prefer using discord, although Reddit is also fine. I\u2019m fine with doing both first and third person. I like writing at least 4-6 sentences per response, but I\u2019m not crazy about length.

When a man goes missing there\u2019s a chance they will come back, but what about the men and women who don\u2019t? What is to come to their mortal souls? What about the creatures the ancient societies spoke of, like Skin-walkers, the Leviathan and Werewolves? \n\nThe Somnum is ever consuming, and the greatest threat is those humans who have succumbed to it, they remain as empty shells of their existence, wandering and only seeking to tear the remaining life of those humans who have not yet become a wandering husk. It\u2019s called a Dumping Ground because anything that has been or ever been lost remains there, lost planes, lost places and lost items. That\u2019s when you enter us, a crew of humans wandering the Somnum, trying to escape, or come to terms with the harsh reality.\n\nHey guys! It\u2019s Jen, ya boi \ud83d\ude05, as you could tell from the post this is a bit of an oddball as I\u2019m mostly drawing from elements to create something entirely new. This is mostly creative writing and ideas so feel free to be as creative as you are, and if you\u2019re looking for a linear, more two-dimensional plot this may not be  entirely for you. I\u2019m a busy person so I enjoy longer responses but on a more day-to-day basis, I have a big preference for detail oriented players and people who can double up on OC\u2019s, and here are some of mine.\n\nMargaret Barnes (Private Investigador) - Margaret was  alive in the 50\u2019s, investigating whatever arrived on her desk, from citizens and government alike. She was investigating a strange cult, a group of people gathering in the sewers and sacrificing cats, maybe even people, so she ventured down hoping to find them. But when authorities never heard back they considered her a victim of the cult, just another one caught and killed. She stands at 5\u20199\u201d, wears the typical noir trench coat and fedora, with long Auburn hair and piercing dark eyes.\n\nHana Masaki (Warrant Officer) - Serving in the Japanese Imperial Army as an infantry came naturally to Hana, inspired by the tales of the Samurai she fought in the trenches of Europe. Her regiment was in a dangerous offensive when she joined the charge in No Man\u2019s Land, a bomb blowing her to the side, assuming she died, her allies returned to their side, the Germans considering her dead, she joined the Somnum. She stands at 5\u20195\u201d with green military fatigues, tied up black hair and softer green eyes.\n\nI do have a preference for Margaret so keep that in mind if you don\u2019t want to double up, I like MxF and FxF pairings.",

I have a real life and you do too, so I'm understanding of delayed responses as long as we communicate OOC about them. I tend to write novella style and in 3rd person past tense. I roleplay on Discord only. Please do not contact me if you are under 21. \n\nOkay, now onto the fun stuff! \nI absolutely love Spence and I think I've watched enough CM to be able to convincingly portray him. I'm looking for a detailed storyline with a solid writing partner that allows me to give it a shot. \n\nI am not looking to carry a storyline or tell you a story. I want a strong writing partner who can reflect on their character, the setting, back stories, has good recall, etc. I am not looking for characters who are only their trauma. I love hurt/comfort as much as the next but please do not make trauma the centrepoint of all interactions. I also need a partner who can play the other characters of the show with me as well, each manning them as logic allows, otherwise the story will go stale. \n\nAnyway, if you're interested in chatting more please dont hesitate to reach out. If possible, give me an idea of the character you want to bring to the table (OCs only please).",

            "selftext": "Recently the idea of zombies popped up in my head. However, I wanted to make it a little unique. Here's my idea:\n\n**The roleplay has two options. It can begin just before the apocalypse, or shortly after it has already started. It's your choice on where this RP begins. The idea is for us to play out the early stages of the zombie apocalypse and develop our characters throughout the span of a long term roleplay.**\n\n**The zombies will be slow, similar to The Walking Dead. If you're a fan of The Walking Dead, we can even use their world and rules for zombies in this RP--although I'll admit I don't know all of the lore surrounding the fandom.**\n\n**Now--the twist. The twist is that an extremely small percentage of humans bit by a zombie will be immune and won't turn. Not only will they not turn, but they'll develop a unique ability--a power. On top of that, the person that was bit would have had to survive the encounter in the first place. So.. you can see why there won't be many survivors with powers roaming the world.**\n\nThere it is! Nothing too out of the ordinary, but I definitely believe it has potential. Now to list what I'm looking for in partner:\n\n* Literate.\n* Capable of responding with two paragraphs per reply, minimum. Sometimes a single paragraph is perfectly acceptable!\n* Third person.\n* Daily/frequent response rate. Obviously life happens and I'm alright with the RP being put on hold to prioritize whatever else is happening.\n* Friendly OOC chatter! This roleplay WILL be **long term**, so I'd like to form a bond with my partner.\n* Creative/Passionate! Be able to flesh out a character with relative detail.\n\nThanks for reading, everyone. I hope to hear from you all soon!",

I don\u2019t care you actual gender as long as you play female. I tend to use shorter posts and 1st person but have been trying to branch into longer posts and 3rd person but I find that I i slip up a lot and use i say instead of he said a lot for example so if you want longer reply\u2019s or 3rd person that\u2019s fine you\u2019ll just have to be patient. I prefer chat but discord is good too. Any questions can be asked in private or comments.\n\nI had several ideas for a plots and will be happy to share more or create one together but in terms of tone I want something sweet and wholesome and happy to cheer me up a bit. For example a new couple (around 20) moving into there first home in a new town and filling it with cute scenes like breakfast in bed or just snuggling by the fire. But like I said we could create a completely different plot the only thing I require is cute Romance. And if this is still up I\u2019m accepting partners....even if you just wanna chat about life.",

All A ever wanted was to have a family, but years of trying and failing have left them feeling broken. Is it A's fault or their partners? One night A falls for B (one night stand, old friends reunited) and A's wish comes true. \n\n\n3. Three shifter packs have been at war for decades, now new leaders have taken over just as things take a darker turn. Food supplies are low, kids are missing. And each pack is blaming the other. (forbidden romance between packs, drama)\n\n4. We live in a world where young humans are paired with a young shifter who is tasked with protecting them. A is young shifter who is being paired with a human who isn\u2019t the kindest, one night A runs away. B finds them and offers them a new home.",

There are certain interests my partner could have, that would make it easier for us to relate our characters, but it's not necessarily a \"must have\". My character likes nerdy stuff in general, from fantasy novels to video games. If you're a nerd, or a gamer (especially not a misogynist one), it would be of great help. Tell me some of your interests before we start.\n\nThis should be written in third person, and even though Discord is my preferred platform, we should keep this in the DMs or chat for now, to see how it works out. My entries vary in size, usually one or two paragraphs, or less in dialog scenes. That thing we do for reproduction (pls don't kill me mods) is optional. And partners of any gender (both cis and trans) are welcome. DM me if you're interest, with your answer to my intro.\n\n-//-\n\nSophia had never felt this nervous before.\n\nShe sat in silence on the passenger seat next to her father for two hours, while the landscape passed through her eyes, wondering how things would be from now on. She had had to move out with her mother eight years ago, after her parents got divorced, which caused not only many issues between them, but also made her lose contact with her best friend.\n\nSophia missed the small town in which she had been born, the calm and peaceful routine and her father, but she couldn't stop thinking about her friend, and childhood crush. How much would they have changed? Sophia herself was probably just a cute little thing with messy red locks in their memories, and she had changed a lot herself.\n\nShe was 5'9, proudly taller than most girls, with white pale skin and freckles on her nose and cheeks. Her curled wavy hair had a beautiful tone of red, and her eyes were green. Sophia wore a beautiful black hair and boots, which she had chosen for the occasion. Before her mind could drift back to her friend, her father's voice pulled her out of her own thoughts. \"They kept asking me about you. This whole time. You two were *really* close, weren't you?\" He asked with a clever grin, knowing the answer already.\n\nThe ginger frowned, a little embarassed of him, before she realized they were already parked in front of the garage. \"I'll be back in a sec.\" She said, opening the door and walking towards the neighbour's house, ignoring her father's mumbling about having to carry her baggage by himself. She stopped right in front of her friend's door, and hesitated only for a second before finally ringing the doorbell. *It's now or never*.",

I\u2019ve been roleplaying for 6 years, with a small break. I mostly write in first person. I use OC\u2019s mostly and sometimes they represent myself a bit but that just depends on the kind of rp. I like to have an ooc because I like to get the know the person who I\u2019m rping with and just be friends so we can discuss ideas. \n\nAs for the fantasy element, I like some vampire/wolf rps. It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve done one like that though and I prefer it to be realistic. \n\nI write semi-lit and advanced. I just don\u2019t like one liners or using * *. But I do get it if in a certain context that you can\u2019t say much. I also don\u2019t like it if someone controls my character. \n\nI have some ideas but I would love to hear yours as well!

I\u2019m usually more of a forever GM, but would like to take a break from being solely in charge of the narrative. I figured I would put out some feelers and see if anyone had some plot ideas in need of a character. \n\nMy favorite genre is medieval fantasy, both high and low. I also like mythological, steampunk, and fairy tale settings. I enjoy lighthearted and dark stories alike. My favorite roleplay themes are romance, magic, slice of life, traveling adventures, dark academia, knights, arranged marriages, vampires, humor, witch craft, mismatched pairs, and redemption arcs.\n\nAs the title suggests, I have a ton of characters that can altered fit into most any situation. I can also make a new one tailored to your tastes. You can never have too many. I can play side characters if needed.\n\nI write in 3rd person past tense. I write around 1-4 paragraphs. I can usually post every day, but may miss one occasionally. I\u2019m not concerned with how much you write or how often as long as you\u2019re good with me sticking within my range. I\u2019m 18+ and looking for the same. Discord is the best platform for me.\n\nPlease share your ideas with me and I\u2019ll do my best to find a character that will fit it.",

After reading them and kinda enjoying my mind started racing, coming up with my own plot ideas! And so I\u2019ve made a cast of ocs, various other plot points and a storyline that extends on from the games finishing! All I need is a protagonist to play off of!  The story begins at the 74th games, and continues onward from there!  Should be fun! Let\u2019s both throw ourselves into it and have some fun!\n\nFar more information upon messaging me!  Panem is similar to in the books but altered in a few ways which I\u2019ll describe upon further contact! Please send me your oc\u2019s details!  Name, age, District, Personality traits, Family information, Backstorg, m skills and your discord address if you wanna do this!  Look forward to hearing from ya\u2019ll!  Your oc will interact with many of my characters and have plenty to do! It shall be full of action, some moments of comedy and tragedy. Also, please no total completely inactive edge lords. Protagonists that don\u2019t go out of their way to do anything.  Your character can be reserved for sure if you want them to be but nobody super bland if that\u2019s okay!\n\nI\u2019m also looking for people who can post at least 1-2 decently sized paragraphs per message! Hope to hear from you soon! Sorry for the messiness of this post in general too, my rp writing is much more polished!",

            "selftext": "\nWith the publicity the Court of Owls is getting, and the Caped Crusader being very relevant... I figured I\u2019d try my luck. I do hope you enjoy reading this advertisement!\nI\u2019ve been a fan of Batman for as long as I can remember- my comic collection began to pile and pile up; I watched every movie, TV series, and played any game related to him times over. Soon I began to understand him absolutely- his brooding and protectiveness; his immense intellect to his sheer ferocity. Coupled with the fact I love to write... I just knew I had to be him. \n\nSo, what\u2019s a Batman without his Catwoman? I\u2019m looking for someone to take the mantle of Selina Kyle as we explore the duo taking on what is possibly their biggest challenge yet- together. \nI am looking for an adv-lit/novella partner for this; as I want to really dive into the complexity of our characters, and Gotham City\u2014 really enjoy the story. I probably don\u2019t have to say this, but there will definitely be romance, and that will actually be a big part of this Roleplay. You also must be okay with some mature themes- such as strong language and gore, because Gotham is a deep, dark place... that goes without saying. I don\u2019t mind if you don\u2019t completely know DC inside-and-out, but at least hold some knowledge of Batman\u2019s immediate allies and villains- also known as the Rogues Gallery. I do intend for us to balance out playing side characters such as the Bat Family, and the all-important villains. I think that\u2019s all of my requirements out the way! Please do enjoy the plot below- let it be known I have a Discord, which is largely prefer RP\u2019ing on. I can give that out in DM\u2019s. Please don\u2019t contact me via Reddit\u2019s chat system, as I will only be answering my PM\u2019s.\n\n\nPlot:\n\n\n2021, Gotham City, the State of New Jersey. \nThe solemn streets, slick with rain, howl a hallowed past, and allude to the dark future of the mega city. \nNeon scintillates in puddles, the luminescent gloom of Wayne Enterprises. \nFor once, it\u2019s quiet. \nGothamites know what it\u2019s like to live again- as humans. \nAll until The Dark Knight stumbles upon a lone cadaver, stowed away on the smoky, gritty rooftops of Gotham\u2019s East End. \nFaceless, mutilated; its gender stripped from it, from diabolical surgical meddling.  \nEven to the grizzled, hardened vigilante, it\u2019s a grim sight. \nNext to it, on the archaic, charcoal black bricks: \u201cIMPERFECT\u201d, written in cheap white paint, as if it was a form printed From a computer... a steady hand conveying its message to the world. \nThis was no murder, robbery, assault.\nThis was a targeted crime against humanity. \nAnd Batman was working on borrowed time, until he struck again.\n\nThough the reign of the Caped Crusader was famed and absolute, the East End had its own reluctant protector... the elusive Catwoman.\nUpon her mischievous deeds, the cat burglar stumbles upon a similar sight- a deceased soul, carved in the same way. \nBatman and Catwoman decide to partner up, to catch this abhorrent killer...\nBut, unbeknownst to them, it was all a distraction. \nA deep seated malevolent corruption Imbeds itself within City Hall, using the string of shocking murders as something to keep Gotham\u2019s protector occupied. \nNow the unlikely duo is forced to do more than simply investigate a murder, but save Gotham City from an invasion centuries in the making...\nThe Court of Owls have decided to strike- with Batman and Catwoman being the only driving force to stop them. \nWith an attack from all fronts, the duo bond in a fight for their lives...",

The other is a Paleontologist, who was brought on as a consultant for the film, and boy was she desperately needed because apparently nobody on set know anything about the time period the film is trying to replicate.\n\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019m looking for in an rp partner\n\nSemi frequent replies\n\n3rd person past tense\n\nDecent grammar \n\nOriginal characters please, nothing from ready made works like books or shows.\n\nSomeone near my age \n\nSFW (anything NSFW can be skipped) \n\nPreferably nothing too advanced, I can write the occasional long message but in general I like to stick with one liners and at the most one or two medium long paragraphs.\n\nIf you want to DM me I\u2019d appreciate if you let my know\n- Your age\n- If you have a ready made character, it\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t.\n- If you have any specific preferences in how to rp\n- any triggers or boundaries your prefer not to be crossed\n\nHope to hear from you.",

First a bit about me, my name is Alice, I'm an artist and I like to play games and write in my free time which as of late I have too much of. I don't have much to ask of potential candidates aside from being over 18, open for out of character talks, and one who despises ghosting as much as I do. I like to keep these posts short and sweet so I hope to hear from some of you wonderful peeps, till then I bid you adieu. \n\nP.s. if you have read it all and understand what im asking thank you for taking the time to do so, I ask one more thing before you dm me instead of a hello tell me a bit about yourself.",

This person would enjoy GMing a fictional world using something akin to pre-fourteenth century technology, and bring with them to the table an understanding and comprehension of world history (where applicably useful) and grasp economics, trade, warfare, and other topics related to nation-management.\n\nThe intent is to organize a story told through the perspective of an individual who will, not long into the RP, rise to the rank of landed nobility and be cursed with the responsibilities of such a position. In my mind their situation is a tenuous one, barely held onto as numerous crises threaten to overcome them, demanding clever decision-making and policies to save their own skin as well as those they've been charged to protect.\n\nI write at length, appreciate inventive uses of the English language and metaphor, and would appreciate a partner whom does the same.",

I've been watching this sub for a while (well.. mainly stalking then dming whoever seems promising.) and I figured it's about time I post. \n\nI can write multiple paragraphs 5 - 7 sentences a pop, but I will write and work with what you give me a lot of the time. As far as plots go, I have a list, but if you have any ideas please tell me first! Sometimes people bring some pretty great ideas and i'm sure you have something to offer. I do slice of life, fantasy, and sci-fi. \n\nI can play any gender and gender pairing, but keep in mind my gxg game is lacking. \n\nI usually get everything started on reddit chat, roleplay for a bit and decide if I like the rp or not. If I do, i'll offer my discord or we can resume on reddit chat at that point! It's up to you. :&gt;",

            "selftext": "Hello, I'm seeking a roleplay partner for a 1 on 1 Fantasy roleplay using discord.  \n\nI am a 30 y/o M and have no real preference on my partners skill. I simply want to have fun and tell a story together.  Some of the things I'm looking for in this roleplay are : Action, Romance, Character growth, and some fun world building. \n\nI like to roleplay in 3'rd person, however you're free to roleplay however you like.  Below is an example starter ( and writing sample). We do not have to use this starter, and can discuss more in DM if you prefer.  I'm looking forward to meeting you :D\n\nAs I'm over 18+, I ask the same of my partner please.  My response time is usually between 1-3 days ( at times though, I've been known to bullet respond as well.)  \n\n\\----\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe snow capped mountain stood on the horizon, its magnitude only matched by its beauty. The thick forest seemed to disappear halfway up, just where the clouds touched the earth. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Three? No, four days ride from this distance, or far more by foot.\"  he thought, resting his armored hand atop the hilt of a small jeweled dagger strung to his belt.  A slightly exasperated sigh escaped his lips as he imagined the journey ahead. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"I should have charged more.\" He thought, scolding himself. His lips pursed, then parted for a deep breath and off he walked down the worn dirt path, the clank of his polished iron armor and the chirping of birds the only noise around. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDusk had started to set in, and the once cerulean blue sky morphed into a spectacular gradient of orange, yellow, and purple.  He walked past the wooden stake pole fences that now separated the villagers herds from one another.  The stench of cattle and goats fumigated his helmet prompting him to carry it the rest of the way in town. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe clank of his armor brought with it, as it always did. Many eyes. From wildlife to the curious locals, not many had seen his armor before. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe stopped at what appeared to be the town center, if you could call it that. Pitiful shabby wood stalls slanted in place, with ripped fabrics barely covering the belongings below. He fished in a small leather pouch with one finger trying to remove the parchment he had been given only 2 days prior. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Glavendal, This is a matter most urgent. Please, seek me in the farming village of Yekkin. I'm sorry I can't say more. Come quickly. \" The signature on the parchment had smeared and next to it, a seal hastily burned into the paper. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHis eyes shifted to the small makeshift sign setting atop a a crude wood post. \"Yekkin.\"",

But before we get more into that there's a few things that you should know about me before we start contacting each other.\n\nFirstly I only roleplay with people who are eighteen plus, this isn't necessarily because of any NSFW content but because I am over that age and would feel more comfortable roleplaying with someone else also over that age.\n\nSecondly I am a literate roleplayer, what this means is i will almost always give at least three paragraphs sometimes more, and I'd like it if my partner did the same. I feel like it's hard to become invested or stay interested in the story we're telling with any less, at least that's how i personally feel about it definitely no one liners please.\n\nThirdly I will only roleplay in third person just because that's how I've been doing it and for me it just feel slightly awkward to roleplay in any other format I won't budge on this it's hard for me to roleplay with someone when were doing two totally different perspectives it takes me out of the story completely\n\nI'm sure you could tell from the title but I only roleplay on discord it's just the platform that is easiest for me and that i can respond too the fastest so i won't change to Kik or any other platform for our roleplay.\n\nAnd lastly I'm sure you're curious about what kinda story i wanna tell with Peter Parker Spider-Man there's a lot of options but at the moment I'm up for anything and I'm sure we can discuss more and come up with amazing stories on discord feel free to give me a message and send me your discord so excited to roleplay with everyone!",

            "selftext": "Hello all.\n\nI'm looking for someone interested in cartoon fandoms but in which all canons are aged up and things are set in college. I like to RP via discord. I work at a slow pace so someone who is patient or has the same pace would be awesome. As these are cartoons, I would like to retain some humor and charm but I would love to inject more mature concepts and take things a little more seriously (be a bit more realistic regarding consequences, relationships and stuff). Below are concepts I have in mind, my ships are a little unusual. I am open to suggestions and multiple pairings. Please be literate and open to discussions. Nothing is worse than a partner who can't hold a conversation, be it about the RP or life in general. \n\nIf you have a show/ship you're interested in, let me know. These are just the top 5 I've got in mind.\n\nAlso, if you do send me a message, tell me about yourself and what you're interested in doing together, if it's just a 'hi' or something generic, I'm going to assume you're a bot or a troll. I'd prefer PMs for ease of writing more as reddit's chat box is really small.\n\n- - -\n\n**Phineas and Ferb:**\n\nPhineas, Ferb and Isabella are age 18 or 19.\n\nThe boys have gone off to college. Phineas has decided to stay local while Ferb has gone overseas. Rather than stay local as well, Isabella decides to study at the same school as Ferb. While adjusting to life in Britain, the two begin to grow closer together. While Isabella felt her crush on Phineas was one-sided, she realized Ferb might be a better match for her. She spent countless summers watching them and going on adventures, that she wondered if her feelings were misplaced with Phineas. I haven't seen all episodes but I am working on expanding my knowledge of the fandom. I am open to other characters though right now I'm digging Ferb/Isabella above all else.\n\n**Hey Arnold:**\n\nHelga, Arnold, Gerald, and Phoebe are age 18 or 19.\n\nThe gang graduates from high school to college. In this situation, Arnold and Phoebe end up growing closer together as their classes overlap with one another. Meanwhile, Gerald and Helga also begin to spend more time together. I am open to doing Helga/Arnold as a couple, and Gerald and Phoebe instead but I do think Arnold/Phoebe might be a better match. I'd love to develop these characters further, not sure I want to deal with that second movie since I found it didn't offer much to the series, sadly. I'm open to other characters aged up too. Maybe something like Herald/Rhonda? \n\n**Star vs The Forces of Evil:**\n\nStar and Marco are 18, if not 19 here.\n\nStar and Marco go to community college together. Pretty much the same premise as the other two shows, however I'd love for them to also see more of the world. We can figure out if we want to tweak the finale as it does change the presence of magic. I assume all magic is gone but the world and Mewni are somewhat merged. I'd also be fine with no magic and no Mewni as well, we'd deal with Marco and Star bonding over non-magical antics. Or we find a way to bring magic back? Generally this is a Marco/Star RP but I might be open to Tom with Jackie or Janna? Aged up of course.\n\n**American Dad/Family Guy:**\n\nFor this RP Steve is 18, Meg is 19, Snot is 18, Chris is 18 and Toshi is 18. And Haley is 22.\n\nI feel like these characters can really blend well together. I could see them all meeting in college as well or we could take them out of Langley or Quahog entirely to say the west coast? I think pairs like Steve/Meg, Snot/Meg would work. Maybe Toshi/Haley or Toshi/Meg? I'm just spit balling here but I think it could be fun.\n\n**Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius:**\n\nJimmy, Libby, Sheen and Cindy are 18. Or older.\n\nLastly, is this other classic Nick cartoon. I would imagine Jimmy/Cindy is my biggest pair but I am open to her with Sheen or Libby with Jimmy instead. I think they would continue to be friends as they navigate adulthood together. I imagine Cindy and Jimmy would still be quite smart but hopefully mellowed out some. I'd love to develop them further. Given how smart the gang is, I imagine we'd have a lot of fun.",

            "selftext": "Hey, everyone. These days I'm usually looking for fandoms, and I do have several strong cravings in previous posts that you can check out if you're so inclined - but I also periodically decide to resurrect all my old original concepts on the off chance I might find another really great partnership (or two). Hopefully I'll catch someone's eye. (:\n\nI do have a few things for which I'm specifically looking in a partner, though, so let me lay those out for you before I get ahead of myself:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. I'm looking for \"advanced/literate\" partners with as much love of the language as I have (know your possessives, \"your\" vs. \"you're,\" proper comma usage, flowing sentence structure, etc.).\n2. I only do hetero pairings, and my characters in these ideas are all female.\n3. I'm a SFW writer. Think PG-13; I love romance and conflict, but don't get gross. That said, 18+ partners are still preferred.\n4. I'm well into my 20s, so I don't feel comfortable writing with minors.\n5. Email is preferred, but I can do others. Just ask.\n6. I don't do one-liners. Multi-para, please. Give me something to work with (preferably without giving me eight-page novellas every post).\n7. Sometimes I disappear. It happens. I have major depressive disorder and can sometimes lack the motivation to reply. If that happens, poke me. I might say I'm not into it, or I might just be having a bad day. If it doesn't work out between us, please know that it's me - not you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll righty, so, ideas next? I think so.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**A. Moon Dancers (Medieval Fantasy):**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost of life as humanity knows it is lived during the day. The world awakens at dawn and retires at dusk, unfailingly. There are nocturnal beasts, of course, but those are just animals. And what traveler or criminal hasn\u2019t stayed up to walk by the moonlight many a time himself? Even still, night is meant for sleep and silence, and daytime for work and play. But that\u2019s not true of every sentient race in the world. There is a race of people, called the Aventine (AH-ven-teen), who not only live their lives at night, but are physically incapable of retaining consciousness in the daytime. Think of them as the \u201celves\u201d of the world \u2013 magical, fairly mysterious, largely peaceful, in tune with nature. Not a lot has been known about them over the centuries. They keep to themselves most of the time. In old days, they would even play harmless, good-natured tricks on their human counterparts, or leave playful messages, or sit and soothe a child who had awakened in the night while his parents slept on. There was goodwill between the two peoples. They were seen as anything from myth and folklore, to guardian angels, to fairies, to spirits of good fortune and blessing. But just as with anything people don\u2019t understand, mystery eventually turned to wariness. A wedge was driven between them as mutual suspicion and fear began to take root, and the \u201cMoon Dancers\u201d (humanity\u2019s nickname for them) withdrew into themselves. They have to be the more proactive in protecting themselves, after all, because of their very nature. Like I said, the Aventine are only active at night. When the morning comes, they immediately fall into a deep slumber, like flowers that only bloom in the evening. Nothing can break that sleep, and it\u2019s not possible to \u201cstay up late.\u201d They\u2019re completely vulnerable if this happens out in the world \u2013 not something you really want when the other race finds you unnerving at best and downright malicious at worst. What usually happens, and is supposed to happen, is that they retreat into the Vale, a magical place kind of existing outside the normal realm. There, they\u2019re free to sleep and dream away the whole day. Now, I have in mind to play a young Aventine woman with your typical failings of curiosity, rebelliousness, wanderlust, and inquisitiveness. She\u2019s restless with this careful life of secrecy, always watching the sleepy human towns and villages, wondering if they\u2019re really so bad. I\u2019d like the other role to be left up to you: do you want to play a human? Someone who encounters her, with ensuing potential for adventure as they learn about each other and have to protect each other from their respective peoples? Or do you want to play another Aventine who is either tasked with keeping her out of trouble or is trying to convince her because he actually cares for her, with that potential for adventure as they\u2019re discovered and cut off from the Vale and have to navigate this terrifying world ruled by humans? There are lots of possibilities here, and I\u2019d really like to brainstorm with you more about the world, the story, etc. The only thing I ask is to play against a male character, because\u2026hopeless romantic.\\~\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**B. The Wyv (Medieval Fantasy):**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are beings called Wyverns in the world. They have a form that looks like normal humans on the surface, and they were once a thriving, powerful race. They have formidable magic, live extraordinarily long lives, are even purported to have prophetic capabilities, and their other forms are similar to dragons - hence the name. Derp. They lived largely in peace with the other races of the world, even somewhat deified by mortals. A long time ago, the other races of the world started hunting them like animals, sometimes for the hide of their beast forms, sometimes to harness their magic. They were largely wiped out over the years and are now very rare and \\*very\\* hidden. A lot of people actually think they're extinct, and some don't believe they were ever anything more than legends and fairy tales. The discovery of one would be a big deal, and among nations that are in conflict, having something like that in their arsenal would give the holder quite an edge. I would like to play a young Wyv either in captivity by one such nation, or on the run from it, and I'm looking for someone to build his/her own \\*non-Wyv\\* character and collaborate on the world and story with me. I want you to have creative freedom with your character. The only thing I ask is that there be no human-animal hybrids, and no other Wyv. That would defeat the purpose.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**C. Demon Seed (Medieval Fantasy):**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, the idea is that there's this one kind of magic that is seen as unholy and evil. It's also an exceedingly rare gift; someone is born with it only once every (insert large amount of time here). There is a legend and superstition surrounding them that says they're the descendants of a demon who in ancient times came and bred with mortal races to corrupt them and steal them away from their benevolent gods. These people are referred to as demon seeds and are both hated and feared. They're seen as bringers of death and misfortune. And over the eons, this view has been supported by the seeds - because being hated and mistreated will ruin people, and many of them became the villains everyone said they were.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girl will be the current seed, shrouded in superstition, trying to make sense of what she actually is and how the world sees her. I'd like to discuss more world- and story-building with my partner and leave the other character up to you entirely.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**D. Inseparable (Medieval Fantasy):**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis one is actually the only one in which I'm not looking for romance. Rather, I'm looking for a deep platonic bond between my character, a sentient creature type, and yours, some sort of humanoid creation (the only races I'd like to avoid are the ones considered half creature/half human).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, bear with me, here. My character is a half-demon (apparently I'm in a demonic mood?) tigress. There are two \"clans,\" for lack of a better word, of feline creatures that are more than just wild animals. They're bigger, they're sentient, they can \"speak\"; think of them as more spirit creatures than animals. I gave them ridiculously corny names eight years ago when I came up with this, so I'm not going to embarrass myself by putting them here - but essentially, the panthers are bad, and the tigers are...considerably more benevolent. You do not want to run into a panther at the best of times; you only have to worry about a tiger if you've wronged them or the lands they protect. Panthers are demon-cats, like one of my tabbies would be if she had supernatural abilities. If it helps, I'll call the tigers the angels. Guardian spirits, more like.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo. My character is the product of mixed parentage. Her mother was a tiger; her father was a panther. Don't ask how that happened. The world is not black and white. She lost her mother as a cub, however, when poachers raided the glen her kind called home and pretty much wiped them out (my guess is they had some help, if you know what I mean). I would like to find someone to play a character who finds this little mystical fuzzball, \"raises her,\" probably without either of them really knowing what she is, and thus creates such a sweet, timeless bond of friendship.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe could either start with their meeting and then time-skip to adulthood a few years later, or start with adulthood. Beyond that, the challenges they face, the rest of the story, any baggage of your character's own to bring into play - that's all open and up for discussion. It's just the relationship and my own character I have.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**E. Wishes &amp; Whims (Flexible):**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I had a dream last night, and it's led me to doing some plotting and musing today. I'd like to do something involving a genie, of sorts - only not exactly the typical \"three wishes\" deal. I envision young female spirit sort of being, trapped by some great power and freed by a young man, who then becomes her \"master.\" Now, I'm not talking about \\*that\\* kind of master, so kindly get your mind out of the gutter. She would attach to him; want to do things for him and make him happy; protect him at all cost. It may be that once, these beings were in partnership with humanity (and/or other mortal races); a soul link would be created between two individuals who were compatible, and they would fight together, with the human(oid) channeling the spirit's energy. I'm thinking that there are certain people who are \\*born\\* with the innate ability to link with them. Perhaps humanity began taking advantage of this partnership/pact system, however, and began using the links to conquer instead of just protect. So, most of them abandoned humanity and refuse to pact now - but she didn't. She still believes, and is waiting for her soulmate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOr maybe she's just extremely grateful to be freed. I kind of like pact systems, and a bond growing out of that, but I'm totally open to discussion and brainstorming, too! It's just a rough idea I pulled out of the air, anyway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**F. Fish Out of Water (Realistic/Fantasy):**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(Note: This is probably the lowest on my preference list. I've had a few attempts to start it, but it always sort of falls flat. So I'd love to get a really good version going, but I'm a little discouraged about it. Keep that in mind.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is kind of a mix of modern realistic and medieval fantasy settings. It involves a young man from the \"real\" world (our world), and a girl from another world entirely; a world with magic and knights and medieval kingdoms. However, unlike your typical, patriarchal systems, her homeland recognizes equal female authority, as well as female knights and warriors. The world from which she hails is currently under threat of cataclysm, and the girl in question is one of those warriors. Though young, she was tracking down some magical doo-dad to help her country turn the tide of impending doom, but she was intercepted by a powerful sorcerer on the other side. There was a fight, and in the commotion, the artifact was destabilized, and there was an accident. She (along with the object) got dumped into another realm. Boom. Earth. She has no idea where she is, or how to navigate this odd place and its even odder customs. Enter your character. Whether he's some plain 9-to-5-er, or something more interesting - that's up to you. It may even turn out he's some special, prophesied hero in her world and doesn't know it. The point is the comedy, frustration, and emotion of the fish out of water situation. If you've seen the movie, Enchanted, you can see an example of that - though I'm not intending to play a giddy, stereotypical Disney princess. She's fiery and determined. I do want a bond to form between them, though. And eventually, I think it would even be cool to take the RP back into \\*her\\* world, where \\*he's\\* the one floundering,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**G. Reverse Phantom of the Opera (Paranormal or Fantasy):**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I've finally seen the show, and I love it, but I'm not looking for a direct copy. It simply serves as the inspiration for an idea I had; I'd like to change up the genders (i.e. female phantom) and potentially make her \\*actually\\* a ghost of sorts, or some other kind of being, \"haunting\" the theater. It's really just a rough, vague concept, but it's open to all kinds of discussion and interpretation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**H. Post-Apocalyptic:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't really have any specifics on this; it's more a general genre. However, I do not want zombies. I want something more sci-fi and dystopian than horror or fantasy. Ruined civilizations, humanity struggling to survive... That kind of thing. Rating rules still apply here, though!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I. Paranormal Collaboration:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTalking actual ghosts, here, not just things flying off shelves a la corny ghost hunting \"documentaries.\" I'd love to play a ghost against a human. I actually have a little plot bunny for this involving a ghost who doesn't know she's dead and a freelance/hobby photographer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**J. Science Fiction:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also love sci-fi and am happy to come up with an idea together. Except for my Star Trek love (Voyager), though, I'm not interested in space travel. I like artificial intelligence subjects and futuristic things, but not really keen on aliens and interstellar ambling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**K. Frozen (Medieval Fantasy):**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBased on a song, not the Disney movie. This one is also not romantic, but I'm still looking for a male character. It involves twins, a young man and woman, and a massive secret kept by the sister from her brother at all cost. Historically, she had always been a happy, friendly, open girl. Suddenly, after the invasion of sorcerers and their demon familiars leads to the death of their parents, she becomes hard and closed off, but extremely protective of her brother. The exact reason remains unknown (though I'll happily tell you if you want spoilers), but the two are nearly inseparable as she tries to protect him and he tries to find his old sister once more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's based on the song, \"Frozen,\" by Within Temptation. If you listen to it, it will give you a good idea of what's going on. This is an old idea I had while playing WoW, so it's totally up for world-building and fleshing out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**L. Hand of Sorrow (Medieval Fantasy):**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you might be able to tell, this story uses Within Temptation's \"Hand of Sorrow\" as its sort of theme song. Basically, there's a guy who's more or less a champion of his people. He's a knight or something, and he has to travel to some holy site to receive his calling. He has a lover, more of a clerical type; sweet and quiet and fully supportive. She accompanies him on the trek. However, once there, they both receive a calling of different sorts. They learn that a great evil will rise and that either the man will die or the evil will. The kicker? She's supposedly the one who will bring this evil to pass and be the greatest enemy. This freaks her out, and she hides herself away in fear for the man she loves and the world. He doesn't believe it and thinks there's another way, and they set out on some adventure in search of a different answer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's room for building and fleshing out on this one, too. Fun fact: I was also inspired by Nickelback's \"Lullaby\" when I came up with this one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**M. Angels (Modern/Realistic):**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis involves a cult of of people who believe in \"mercy killings.\" The primary doctrine, or mission, surrounds providing \u201cmerciful deaths to the irredeemably suffering.\u201d Fittingly, they call themselves \u201cHeaven\u2019s Host,\u201d and the individuals responsible the actual murders are specially-trained assassins called \u201cAngels.\u201d Terminology such as \u201cmercy,\u201d \u201crelease,\u201d and \u201cfreedom\u201d are used liberally while there is not a single mention of words like \u201cmurder,\u201d showing it to be a psychological state of delusion rather than a self-acknowledged band of hit men. The members of the Host truly believe that they are doing the work of angels and profess to value peace and compassion above all else, yet outside the walls of their weekly meeting place, every person appears absolutely normal, with normal lives and responsibilities. We can play this several ways: a \"suffering\" victim and their would-be \"savior,\" two members of the cult, or a member and a former member now marked as a target because they've fled and are deemed to be suffering. I d'know. We can talk.\n\n\\~\n\nIf you're still with me, please feel free to PM me. I don't respond to comments, so please use the PM function. Thanks!",
