I\u2019m 18, and would prefer you to be the same but I don\u2019t judge.\n\nWhat I\u2019m looking for is simple really; I would like a long-term roleplay set way back when kings and queens ruled the lands. Orcs, goblins and other mythical creatures co-exist with humans like in Skyrim. I will be playing as a simple merchant wandering through the world and whoever you\u2019d like to play as is up to you! \n\nAbout my character:\n\nMy character is a Merchant that travels and sells items he either comes across, steals, buys from others or whatever he makes and tries to pawn off. I have a reference for his attire, but he has shoulder length black hair, a curly beard and bright, vibrant yellow eyes. He\u2019s more on the heavier side, what with having so much money he\u2019s able to afford more food. \n\nI would love to hear from you! I don\u2019t really have a set story plot so I\u2019m up to hearing and discussing plots! Maybe my Merchant needs something from inside the city but he\u2019s been banned from entering due to past deceits? Maybe you\u2019re playing as a goblin and attempt to Mug this one lonely man?\n\nThis is my first post here so if I need to add anything let me know!!! \n\nI use discord and kik so let me know which you prefer!",

            "selftext": "Hello there, and thank you for taking the time to read my prompt! As my roleplays have gotten more on the quiet side, I\u2019m hoping to find new active, literate partners to set up an older Titans roleplay, where the team is now in their early/mid twenties. We can discuss who plays who, however, I would also like to add one of my original characters (who are guys) that I have been working on to play across BB/Garf, so I am asking off the bat you be comfortable playing as him. I have different ones to pick from, between an android, magic user, storm maker and more, so if one doesn\u2019t catch your eye, I\u2019m happy to brainstorm! While the story will revolve around their relationship, there will of course be action, adventures and moments with the canon characters! This plot isn\u2019t the most specific because I want us to tailor and craft it into something we both love and enjoy! I am also happy to double for you in a separate roleplay (I\u2019m told I play a pretty good Starfire), so bring any ideas for that to the table as well! \n\nRules \n\n1. Please be a literate, 3rd person player. You do not need to write in novella format, however your responses should show effort. Usually I give 2-3 decent sized paragraphs, so that would be the minimum I\u2019m looking for. No text talk or bad grammar (minus the occasional slip ups). \n2. Please be active overall. I understand we have lives, however, if you are the type to disappear/ghost, I am not for you. I want us to keep a steady stream going so things don\u2019t get stale! If you do need to leave, please just communicate.\n3. This will be romance and plot focused. Get ready to write something wonderful together! \n4. Because the characters here are going to be 20+, I am asking that you also be 20+ as well (I am 18+ and all participants and characters must also be 18+). \n5. Please be okay with MxM romantic pairings. If we double, I am happy to play any gender pairing for you! \n\nIf interested, feel free to PM me! Thank you so much for reading, and have a wonderful day!",

            "selftext": "Howdy y'all! A little about myself before I go into details. You can call me Jo or Jobe. I am a 20 year old female but I'm turning 21 in June. With that said, I'd really love to find a partner of my age or older! 18+ only please since I do like to roleplay dark, \"they need some help\" themes. Please do not interact with me if you are a minor. I have been writing and roleplaying for about 7-8 years so I've got a tad bit of experience under my belt. I am a cancer, I like to collect vinyl records, and if you can quote star Wars to me, I'll probably fall in love with you. \n\nRoleplay info about me! \n\n- I tend to be semi-lit to fully lit so on my own I can write about a page or two on docs in response but I like to match my partners as to not overwhelm you so I just ask about 2-3 paragraphs at least. \n- I only roleplay in third person. First person can be confusing for me since I'm envisioning my character and not so much myself. I hope that makes sense. \n- I don't care if your character is canon or oc. I'm a world builder so for me, the world will be built around our characters so really go crazy. \n- I only roleplay on discord since it's easier to organize. \n- I am looking for dark, nitty gritty themes so please be open to it. The darker, the better. Think about getting the bad ending at the end of the game times 27. I want to feel like our characters need therapy. \n- I love to talk OOC as much as we can. I love being friends with my roleplay partners. I feel like it helps us connect better to our story and can make things sail easier. I'm a lovey person. It's just in my nature. Love one must. \n- and lastly, since I just moved to a new position at my job, I am going to be a tad busy these next few weeks because I'm still undergoing training and I'm trying to get my schedule fixed and adjusted. I will reply as soon as I can but please be patient with me. Once I'm adjusted at work, I'll be good to roleplay as much as you can! \n\nThat's all I think you need to know for now. Onto themes! \n\nAt the moment, I'm really into medieval times. Think brave heart, Tristan and Isolde, game of thrones, the Witcher, all that good stuff. I really want a roleplay based in those times and I have a few ideas running through my head but I'd love to talk about them more in depth in private. I have a pretty solid idea in my head. \n\nOne of them is there are 7 kingdoms in a realm that are all at peace with each other. Each kingdom has several heirs, both princes and princess. There's this tradition that centuries old that when a princess becomes of age, there is a tournament held in her honor to find her a husband. All the eligible princes in the 7 kingdoms participate for her hand in marriage. Once a prince wins and they wed right after the tournament, they become next in line for the throne of the princess' kingdom. There's a tournament being held for the 5th kingdoms youngest daughter, one of the most beautiful daughters in the land. However, she's opposed to the tournament as she believes that she should be free to marry who she wants. The tournament is still held in her honor despite her defiance. And this year there is the most princes that have ever competed. However, one of the princes (your character) competing runs into a dilemma. He falls in love with a peasant (me lol) who has been watching all of the games from the sidelines  and is also the princess' best friend because she was a rebel when she was young and would always run away from home. And this prince is also the one winning the tournament and is the one prince the princess would actually consider marrying. The perfect recipe for disaster. \n\nThat's all I have for that idea. The rest are just simple tropes that we could do whatever we want with, enemies to lovers, forced marriage to have peace between kingdoms, forbidden love between the kings wife and one of the knights.. I'm sure you get the gist heh. \n\nI think I have write rn enough to completely scare all of you off. If you are still here, I can't wait to hear from you and start building a beautiful story with you!",

            "selftext": "Hello there everybody! So, as the title says ,I'm looking for someone interested in roleplaying Good Omens. I would like someone to play Aziraphale with an OC of mine. I do double so If you would like me to play Crowley or someone just let me know!\n\nI prefer to rp 3rd person and at least 2 paragraphs or more.Plus a decent grasp on grammar and punctuation. I've been roleplaying for 10+ years so I have a lot of experience.  I try to respond once a day but it may take me longer to reply sometimes as I have a full time job,family, pets etc .I also get depression and anxiety so sometimes that plays a role as well. Please don't spam asking me for replies as that only makes me anxious.  Be patient that's all I ask. I like well thought out and literate replies. Put thought,love, and care into your response and honestly length won't be that big of an issue. \n\nDiscord or email is preferred. \n\nThank you!",

(21+)\n\nI would like to RP with someone and draw our characters as well, and develop a plot with both words and pictures. My writing skill is semi-literate and I can do any size reply for the occasion. Drawing skill is not super important but having a visual medium I find adds to an RP a lot.\n\nAs for original characters, a lot of mine are furry and creature-like. I don't mind RPing humans as well but they are less fun to draw. You can check my profile for some example of some cartoony furry art.\n\nFor plots and settings, I really like interesting settings and worldbuilding. I like modern, futuristic, steampunk, medieval, with religious, political, or historical motifs. I definitely like themes of fate, prophecy, or some sort of sweeping plot that gives a bigger picture to the world, rather than just romantic intrigue. Of course I like romance as well though!\n\nAn example of a plot/setting I like would be an ongoing conflict between witches and knights in a medieval fantasy setting, where magic is illegal. Or a world where Buddhism is the main religion, reincarnation is revered, and karma plays a big role in your status and rank. \n\nI haven't RPed in a long time, so I'm probably very rusty. But please let me know if you are interested in what's outlined above. Thank you!",

If you like Luna I can be her as well!\n\nI will do Luna with most of the Weasleys. \n\nHermione x Snape is also a fun pairing that could happen. Luna can be used in Hermione's place. \n\nI can also play Tonks but I don't have alot of practice with that particular character. \n\nI will also play in the Marauders era if you have any suggestions about that. \n\n\nI will also do fantastic beasts and where to find them because Newt is to die for. I have a few little ideas for that. \n\n\nIf there is anything you'd like to suggest feel free. Be sure that you know his is long-term and semi literate. Please don't just say \"hi\".

I used to roleplay on a site called UndeadLabs forums, from the people who made the State of Decay games. I'm looking for someone, male or female, 18+ (I used to hate this rule, but as I got older, I understood why.) and that's about it. I'm not asking for someone to be the Robert Frost of roleplaying, but I would like people to make sure they're not making too many mistakes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe genres that I love writing about are science fiction and apocalyptic. Honestly, if you give me a topic or story you have in mind, and I like it, I'll give it a shot no matter the genre. I do some fandom roleplaying as well, such as Voltron, batfam (I don't care for Bruce, I like playing the robins), Star Wars (Though, just the universe, not specific characters, so all OCs), Star Trek (characters and OCs are welcome for this), and those are the ones at the top of my head.

I have two ideas I'd like to RP so if you fancy writing either one out with me, please send a message my way. \n\nI write in third person and like to write 3-4 paragraphs every time (no, I don't think one liners are ever appropriate, there's always a way to build a short paragraph around even one line). I always play F characters as my main character. \n\nThe ideas:\n\n1.  My character (F) is an investigative journalist working for a newspaper in the city who gets sent to a small town (could be the town she grew up in to add an additional layer or omit this aspect) to investigate a child murder that seems to be related to another murder from a few years ago. The police however do not believe that the cases are related. Your character (M) could be a \"disgraced\" former detective who stood up to some superiors or for whatever reason quit the force and is now a private detective or something like that. We will team up to investigate the crime and maybe a romance will brew between them too. \n2.  We'll play a couple. Your character (M) is an aspiring musician/actor/sportsperson. We're both from a small town and have been together pretty much forever. I'd like to play out how our relationship evolves as we move to the city and your character makes it big. I'd like to include a lot of drama and some more realistic growing pains as well. I'd like to set this around when he first makes it big. So the first taste of fame/success and how it affects our relationship. \n\nWe can flesh out additional details and our characters together :)",

One prince or princess comes of age and must go through an event called The Selection where they must find love from a specific amount of contestants. \n\n**Royal Mistake:** a prince from another country comes to America for school under a disguise and fake name, and falls for a regular American commoner.. It calls for big scandals if anyone finds out who the noble in disguise really is. \n\n**Fake Fianc\u00e9e:** Y/C and his fianc\u00e9e have recently called things off. There\u2019s only one real problem to this... He was supposed to bring her to meet the family at a huge family reunion/wedding/event of your choice. He resorts to calling M/C his college best friend or his best friend\u2019s slightly younger sister, maybe they\u2019re twins, idk.\n\n**Fandoms:** we can discuss Avatar the Last Airbender, My Hero Academia, Disney Descendants, Harry Potter, etc. I personally do not play as a canon character nor do I double, but would like someone else to play as one (though not a requirement as I love original characters just as much). For Harry Potter, I would love to be able to play against Draco Malfoy in our own twist on the story. The other canon character I would love to play against is Zuko from Avatar the Last Airbender.\n\n**The Contract:** two top young rising celebrities don\u2019t get along at all, for various reasons. What happens when their managers go behind their backs and set the two up on a date? Forcing them to sign a six month contract , claiming to be a couple in the public eye. \n\n**The Vlog:** Nothing too crazy is planned out yet. Thinking something along the lines of vloggers/youtubers.",

            "selftext": "HI!! I'm bubbles! I'm a college student in the eastern US. I've been role-playing for about 6 years now but have taken a short break to write a few books, but have hit a major writers block and writing with others and reading gives me inspiration. \n\nI am a semi-lit writer. My writing depends on my mood and inspiration for the day. I try to write 2-3 paragraphs and match what my partner is writing. I love writing romance. I am fine with 18+ things as long as you are, but I can't say I'm the best at writing those scenes. I love storys that are medieval with Kings, Queens, Courts, War. I love fantasy! Werewolves, Demons, Angels, Vampires!! I'm not good at slice of life unfortunately just because I love dissociating myself with reality. \n\nI do have fandoms but have never written a fandom RP before, but I have written self insert fanfiction, so you can always ask!\n\nI have plenty of OCs and worlds in my head and love to flesh them out with you!\n\nSchedule wise I am EST. I have a job and school. I work most evenings but we have hit the slow season so I have a lot of free time on my hands and I'm not the type of college kid that parties on my days off. \n\nI'd love to get to know you and write with you. I use discord mostly but can write on here! Send me a DM or chat! Happy writing friends :)",

            "selftext": "A little about me first: I\u2019m 22 years old, based in New Zealand, and have a passion for writing and history. Currently work allows for casual free time to be able to respond frequently. And I have been roleplaying for 8 years at this point.\n\nMy thoughts are to have a roleplay that explores the future of the Continent and the World of the Witcher books/games. The world there is quite expansive and exciting, and I\u2019d be keen on continuing the story after the events of the Witcher: Wild Hunt. Following Eskel as it\u2019s been mentioned he\u2019s taken over caring for Kaer Morhan after the Battle against the Wild Hunts forces. The plot line I have planned is for him to be trying to find a way in the world as the School of the Wolf has become split and there is less of a need for Witchers on the Continent. I\u2019m drawing upon inspiration from the books and games to have an idea of what the world is start to look like for their place as there are not as many contacts to make a living from. But while the world has been saved by Ciri from the White Frost, there is the prospect of the Conjunction of Spheres happening again, either by chance or force, which likely will bring unknown horrors into this world causing death, distraction and chaos across the Continent. Witchers seem to be the best tool to prevent the coming apocalyptic event, and so Eskel must begin rebuilding the Order of Witchers to prepare a defence of the human realms.\n\nThat\u2019s sort of my premise, Eskel isn\u2019t intending on saving the world, but rather preserving the world as much he can, then fight back. He\u2019s a Witcher, plain and simple, so he\u2019ll do what he does best.\n\nFor this project he\u2019ll need help, specifically from an old friend, either Triss Merigold or Yennifer of Vengerburg. That would be the character you\u2019d be playing, a powerful sorceress and with an established relationship with Eskel. Depending on your choice it will influence the current endgame scenario that the world is in. And we can discuss which ending of the Witcher 3 would be the most realistic or best placed for the plot to take place in.\n\nI\u2019m not too nit picky on grammar and post length. I use Discord but can use another medium if preferred. I would prefer a minimum reply of a paragraph depending on if a short answer is needed. And I won\u2019t mind if you can\u2019t make a reply in the RP for a few days, so long as you don\u2019t outright abandon the RP without warning or explanation. Other than that it should be fun to explore the lore of the Witcher if you\u2019re interested.\n\nGo ahead and send me a message if you\u2019re interested, who you\u2019re interested in RPing as and what ending you think is the most realistic. That way I know you\u2019ve read the entire post. I\u2019ll add a comment if I have an RP partner sorted.",

            "selftext": "Hello, writers of Reddit. I hope that you are all doing well.\u00a0 I am a female in my early thirties, living in New York. I would require my partner to be at least 21 years old.\n\nAs the title states, I am looking for a Marvel roleplay. Romance is an absolute must, but I also balance it out with drama, action, ect. I have not read the comic books, but I have seen all of the movies, including X-Men and Deadpool. I have also seen some of the Netflix series. I have *not* seen Wandavision yet.\n\nI am looking for someone to double  as either Doctor Strange , Matt Murdock or Steve Rogers. In return, I will play any canon requested of me. I have a plethora of experience doubling as Bucky, Steve, Tony, Peter Parker,\u00a0 Peter Quill, Logan sand Wade Wilson.\u00a0 However, please do not be discouraged if I do not have a character you want listed. I have played many more, and I am willing to give anyone a chance as long as I have heard of them.\n\nYou MUST be okay with canon/oc!\n\nWhen it comes to doubling, remaining fair is critical. I can assure you that I will put an equal amount of effort into your pairing. I am sure we have all had a \u2018friend\u2019 or two before who made your pairing of choice feel like a side piece.\u00a0 It takes two people to make a roleplay work, so let\u2019s keep each other happy if we can.\n\nAs far as length goes, I am currently not looking for novel-length. I have one already, and I fear I will not have ample time to write a consistent eight to ten paragraphs per character. Now that being said, I can happily write three to five per character, or more if the situation calls for it. I am looking for a partner who can write at least a detailed paragraph response.\n\nWhile I hate making \u2018requirements,\u2019 I require responses to be written in the third person. First is incredibly awkward, especially if you want adult scenes.\n\nI do not roleplay over Reddit. I will roleplay over email, discord, or google docs, with Google Docs being my most preferred method.\u00a0\n\nLet me know your limits.\n\nFeel free to send me a message if you are interested. I am rather laid back, and I would prefer it if my partner were also. This is a hobby. Outside of writing, I work full-time, and I have a household to run. Please be understanding of that. I am *not* the type of person who can respond multiple times a day. However, I do my best to reply a few times a week.",

A bit to get out of the way beforehand; I'm a semi-lit writer, and depending on how much I like the story, I can write quite a lot! I almost always mirror how much my partner writes. (I prefer at least a paragraph,- meaning five sentences,- so I have enough to work with.) I write in third person only, and I ask that you please do the same if you want to write with me. Also; for the safety of myself and my partner, I ask that you and your character are of age. (I'm 19NB, myself, and I prefer my partners in the 18-23 range. I'm flexible on this, though)\n\nShips (starred characters are who I would be writing):\n\n[ Jujutsu Kaisen ]\n- *Gojo/Geto \u2661\u2661\u2661\n- *Gojo/Nanami \u2661\u2661\u2661\n- *Gojo/Sukuna \u2661\u2661\u2661\n- *Gojo/Toji \u2661\u2661 \n- *Yuji/Megumi \u2661\u2661\u2661\n- \nDon't see a ship you're interested in? Ask me; I might have skipped it.\n\nI write on Discord, as it's the best platform I've found for roleplay. PM me for my tag :-)\n\nIf you have any plots you've been really wanting to do, let me know! I myself am especially partial to angsty and/or dark plots!\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to send them my way! I don't bite!\n\nI hope to RP with you soon!",

            "selftext": "Hey, Godrays here. I'm 20 and I've been roleplaying for about five years, recently gaining an interest for some fandoms to roleplay in as canon characters. I just finished watching the Netflix series Disenchantment and I'd like to play as Luci. As for plot, I'm pretty flexible as I don't have anything in particular in mind, except maybe like, a prequel to Disenchantment centered around Luci before he met Bean. Maybe your character could be another demon. However I'd also be very happy to play him against most of the main characters. Even Chazz and Merkimer. Lol. I just think they're all great fun.\n\nI roleplay on Discord, but you can dm me here so we can discuss details and get a bit of a feel for each other. I roleplay in past-tense, third person, and while I will stick to most canon info about Luci, I also love putting my own spin on canon characters. It just makes it more fun for me. If you like craziness, dark humor, and all manner of debauchery in a fantasy Medieval setting, hit me up. -\\^",

            "selftext": "So, I'm gonna get the biggest potential hiccup out of the way. This is a big RP. I have sixty OCs that will be split between us, 37/23, with me taking on the larger load. However, don't let the huge cast size scare you off! Given the roles these characters fulfill (villains, teachers, students of different classes, etc.), you will rarely be expected to play more than a few at once, as many characters will not receive the same level of \"screentime\" as others, and most of them will be introduced slowly enough. Specifically, the characters are split up as follows...\n\n- My Characters -\n\nClass 1-A Students: 11\nClass 1-B Students: 10\nClass 3-A Students: 1\nSupport Class Students: 1\nTeachers: 3\nVillains: 8\nOther: 3\n\n- Your Characters -\n\n1-A Students: 10\n1-B Students: 10\nTeachers: 2\nVillains: 1\n\nWe can also make additional characters as needed. If the large pool of characters has not scared you off, then great! I think we will get along wonderfully and I hope you continue reading!\n\nAs the title says, I am looking for a female roleplaying partner for a massive, long-term My Hero Academia RP set in an alternate universe of sorts where none of the canon characters ever existed. No Deku, no All Might, no All For One, no canon characters. The plot would mostly be a loose following of the canon storyline, or at least its events would serve as a sort of foundation upon which we can write our own plot.\n\nRegarding post size, I'm looking for a semi-literate or literate partner, but I don't need massive posts. A couple of sentences at a minimum. Write whatever you're comfortable with! I am fine with the occasional one-liner, since I know sometimes there just isn't much happening, so long as it does not become the norm.\n\nIf anyone would be interested in undertaking such a big RP with me, please send me a PM! My timezone is EST, so if possible, I'd like to find someone within a few hours of my timezone, but this is not a requirement!",

            "selftext": " After the fall of mankind and its allies, monsters plague the earth. None can recall exactly how the end of the world, or \"shift\" came about, and few want to spare the resources to go searching as to why. Mutants born of radiation, experimentation, and means unknown wander free, the world theirs for the taking. Tribes of bandits, cannibals, criminals, and everything in between run wild. Even the terrain is dangerous and unpredictable. Acid rain, earthquakes pulling the ground apart, and lightning storms occurring within fog are a few things to be wary of. On top of all these threats are the Dreng; a collective of various types of automata whose purpose and origin is unknown, yet they use extreme prejudice coupled with highly advanced weaponry against nearly any one or thing they cross. Those who still live, either human or otherwise, dwell in heavily-defended cities both above and below ground. Not many venture beyond their own walls, and even fewer live in the wild. Those who do usually sport a prosthetic limb or two, and are armed to the teeth. Guns, makeshift swords, modified body parts, whatever they can get their hands on. Some become legendary hunters, tracking and killing unique and dangerous monsters, while others settle into courier positions to make deliveries between cities. Some of those who venture into the wild return with strange abilities or mutations, thought to be the result of prolonged exposure to the bizarre and unstable world beyond the walls. Most of these occurrences result in relatively simple abilities, such as spitting acid, incredibly thick skin, or even growing a tail, although there have been recorded instances of people sporting more powerful traits, things almost considered magic. Most who acquire these powers are disliked by the general population, considered to be tainted by the world. Still, \"pilgrims\", as they're called, are in short supply, so even mutated pilgrims are considered VIPs. And of course, there are a few individuals who set out on quests to uncover the lost history of earth, or settle a brand new city. Most of them never return, and only about forty percent of pilgrims survive past their second expedition. Welcome to Earth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHiya all, I'm Xentren, and thanks for checking out my post! I'm here looking for partners who are interested in playing around with the scene above, or some rendition of it! First off, I want to apologize if many parts seem overly vague. That was done purposefully, as I intended for my scene to be flexible and easy to manipulate depending on any ideas others would want to throw in.\n\nSecond, I am definitely open to any modifications you'd like to make, or any scenes you'd like to counter mine with! Third, thanks for reading this far! About me, I've been roleplaying for about 4 years and absolutely love it. I tend to respond with AT LEAST a paragraph for my turns, often times more if need be. I tend to match my partner's efforts, so if you give it a good go, so will I! I don't like to talk about my real life much, but I do have things I need to do outside of rp, so unfortunately I wont be able to reply 24/7, please bear with me! I'd also prefer to do longterm scenes, so please keep that in mind if you decide to reach out to me! I think that's about all I have, so of you have any questions feel free to ask me directly! Thank you!",

You read correctly, in the year of 2021, I\u2019m still getting extremely nostalgic over star wars. \n\n\nSpecifically, the show I was lucky enough to grow up with: Clone wars!\n\nI posted a few days ago already, but although my post gained some traction, I still have room for some more new stories!\n\nI have a character ready to go, inserting his entire bio would make this post a lengthy but I\u2019ll happily provide it in pm or on discord! He is a Jedi, so there\u2019s a multitude of roles your character could fill, from his padawan or clone commander to bounty hunter or rival sith lord. Both canon characters and ocs are welcome!\n\n\n\nWhat am I looking for? Basically, just some fun space shenanigans! I\u2019d like some good ol\u2018 sci fi adventuring with plenty of room for character development.\n\n\nWhat you should know about me/some requirements:\n\n\nI\u2018m a 19yo girl from Europe (CET timezone). I\u2018m on very frequently and my posts range from semi lit to literate.\n\n\nPost length is not a huge concern for me, as long as it\u2019s above a one liner and there\u2019s some half decent grammar in there. I\u2018d like someone who\u2018s on frequently as well tho, so if you\u2019re only able to reply every few days, I\u2018m probably not the right partner for you.\n\n\nCommunication is key! It\u2018s something that is very important to me. Everything concerning planning, any issues that might arise, the plot, etc. \nI\u2019m serious. DO NOT CONTACT ME if you\u2019re just going to ghost me after two replies. It\u2019s a waste of time for everyone.\n\n\n\nI think I covered everything so far - if any of this caught your attention, I\u2018d love to hear from you! Please let me know if you\u2019re interested via pm or down in the comments :)\n\n\nMay the force be with you!",

            "selftext": "Hello! I'm looking for a rp partner so I can try out this role properly. I'm hoping for someone who can use the right punctuation and grammar. Cuz if not, I'll slowly lose my mind. I can do rp here, discord or telegram. Contact me here (via pm) so we can discuss further.\n\nAnyway. I've had this idea for a while now. I've never really found anyone who could do this one all that well. I'm hoping for long term and a minimum of 3 lines. \n\nThe story would begin in your character's village, currently having a snow storm raging outside the walls. Ideally, your character would have a dog or at least an animal to alert to something wrong going on outside. Your character would then see a flickering and slowly fading light. Getting their clothes on, your character will approach the light and see a pale, white haired woman (or man) laying in the snow, bleeding from theur back. Worried, your character would take mine inside, bandage their wounds and care for them, slowly learning that they are an angel that was banished for heaven. My character will now have to learn how to live like a human.\n\nIf this doesn't interest you, I have more roles around in my notes.\n\nThank you for reading this far. Hoping to hear from someone!",

It is so tiresome to be approached, then as I ATTEMPT to engage in thoughtful discussion - it seems as though I have to act like a guide for the entire conversation. Nah, not gonna happen. Plus, I get so anxious writing these posts because I worry that many will skim over and not take into consideration of what I want which usually leads to these unfinished plans. I enjoy writing because it's one of my cherished forms of creativity and all I want is minimum (1) partner who matches that same energy.* \n\n*I have been roleplaying for quite a while (10+ years). With the whole lockdown and all (and lack of good television), I am yearning to write with a competent partner who is passionate about story-building over a long period of time.* \n\n*Overall though, I enjoy the immersion, attention to detail, and story-building.*\n\n*Mainly I write male / trans-masculine characters in a modern-esque setting. I prefer a plot that deals with something spanned over a good amount of time. It can episodic in case our plot becomes stuck somewhere. Genres I enjoy to include are: romance; angst; emotional turmoil; realistic fiction; dark side of humanity. Personally I don't have any particular boundaries when it comes to dealing with the grittier side of humanity and encourage those themes to used as obstacles for our characters to overcome (rather than prolong).* \n\n*In a* ***PRIVATE MESSAGE***\\*, introduce yourself. This does not mean: \"Hi, I'm \\[\\]. Blah.\" Actually, introduce your writing style, what you genre you usually role-play in, all of that. It can be as long as you want. The more I understand you as a writer, the better we can work. I won't guide you on what to say, but inform me of things you need me to know. Make it substantial because I usually build off of what my partner gives me for a productive conversation.\\*\n\n*Below are two (2) prompts that I have in mind. They are open-ended on purpose. Pick one you really want resonate with that you want to build off of:*\n\n* *College roommates due to their stark differences in living styles. They blame it on their childhood experiences. One night, an argument reaches a threshold and the duo embarks on a journey of why they are the way they are. This will be long-term and focuses heavily on character development and chemistry. It takes place in a realistic fiction setting, though we can use IRL events as references (this helps with immersion, so please go for it!)*\n* *The treachery of a sibling-oriented relationship. Should we run away or try our best to live the practical lives we were taught? This will be long-term and will include lots of emotional drama, angst, jealousy, and more. It's really open-ended, so our plot goal can go anywhere. This can even have a fantastical element to it such as mythological family reincarnation.*",

            "selftext": "The  small village of Lesserham tells a story to all who pass through. Five  years ago, they discovered a most witch living amongst them. She was  sentenced to hang, but managed to escape into the night before her  sentence was to be carried out. She ran deep into the woods, cursing and  twisting the forest so that none could follow. From her hidden home,  she continues to subtly work her dark magic on the land. Most recently,  she got a young noblewoman to stumble onto her cottage where she has to  stay. The lady\u2019s father is offering a substantial reward as well as his  daughter\u2019s hand.\n\nYour character  would be someone who is out to rescue the lady from the witch. While  he\u2019d make it through the forest to the cottage, there would be a catch.  The lady is cursed and can\u2019t leave the forest. The witch can\u2019t reverse  it, but she can transfer it to your character. What happens will likely  depend on what sort of character you\u2019re playing, but he would somehow  end up staying with the witch.\n\nThis  would kick off a slice-of-life theme where he lives with her and starts  to realize the stories aren\u2019t exactly all true. They\u2019d get close and  fall for each other. However, there would be some defending of the  cottage at times.  At some point, I\u2019d like to change it to more of an  adventure theme where they quest for a way to leave the forest and/or  try to figure out the truth about what\u2019s actually going on.\n\nThe  setting would be vaguely medieval and I think it\u2019d work well as either  high or low fantasy. I\u2019m ok with dark themes. The RP would take place on  discord. While I don\u2019t want to stick to a strict posting schedule, I  can generally reply daily. I mostly enjoy somewhat shorter posts of  around 200-300 words and will mostly stick around there. However, I\u2019m ok  with whatever length you\u2019d like as long as you give me something to  work with. I\u2019m 18+ and you need to be as well.\n\nI hope someone out there finds this interesting!

            "selftext": "I'm looking for anyone who could play as Mercedes.\n\n\"How did Constance and Mercedes end up in one of the deadliest gang wars across the city of Enbarr? Well... Its was all based on one decision. Let's make some money.\"\n\nSidreil is a rare crystal that can only be found in the fiery blazes of Ailell. It is extremely expensive and pocesses a ludicrous amount of magical power. Many of these crystals were found in the treasury of the monastery after the Empire looted the plundered the Monastery. Due to their extreme power, the Empire also sought to get rid of them. Though some imperial soldiers saw the possiblity to make some quick coin. And within a few months the crystals ended up on the black markets of Fodlan. \n\nMercedes decided to open up an orphanage in Fhirdiad but quickly realized that it would be extremely expensive. She travels to speak to Emporer Edelgard but it proves fruitless when the Emperor is unable to help. A local kingpin by the name of \"Vince Esren\" reaches out to her, he has taken an interest in these crystals and has a plan to sell them to a foreign client. Vince needs an appraiser so he reaches out to Mercedes since she has researched them before. Vince also reached out to someone familiar with the underworld who could help with the purchase, Constance Von Nuvelle. Both girls must complete this simple task and they will walk away rich. Things are never that simple.\n\nThe Empire had formed a task force designed to crack down on illegal trading. When they attempted to buy the crystals they were interupted by Imperial Soldiers. As if things weren't bad enough a mysterious cult of Necromancers called \"the Followers\" revealed themselves from the shadows. To add to it a band of mercenaries working for a mysterious client also wants the crystals. It would be an understatement to say that the skirmish wasn't a bloody mess. They lost Vince's money and they didn't get the Sidreil. With the Sidreil missing and the money stolen Vince will have both of them killed if they can't get money back.",

            "selftext": "Hello there! I'm a oftentime lurker and never poster, but I have an itch for Buffyverse and I have to scratch it. Fair warning, this will be a long post, but if you can handle that, you might be able to handle my writing, because it is much the same way. I do try to condense, really I do, but often my posts are really long. People like to measure with paragraphs; I'm not sure about that, but the smallest are usually 600+ words and on average around 1000. I love me some dialogue posts that are shorter, don't get me wrong, but usually it's on the long side. I'm not saying you have to write that much, not at all, but I don't want to write the story all by myself; if you're advancing the story and giving me something to work with, that's all I ask. \n\nI believe in shoving a lot of information into these posts so you can know at a glance if you think we'll make a good fit, or not. I write third person only, I love present tense but I will do past if it makes you more comfortable. I'm fairly literate, I ask that you have a decent understanding of writing. Nobody's perfect, I make mistakes, but as long as it's readable and you use the correct they're their or there then it's fine xD. I am nearly thirty, and while you don't have to be that old, please be at least 18+. I love OOC, I'm always down to talk and gush and chat, and I have hangouts or Discord. For writing, I greatly prefer Google Docs, because I adore the ability to go back and fix my many mistakes that I don't find until later, and also the aesthetic. I really would prefer gdocs, but it doesn't have to be a deal-breaker, just ask and we'll see. I'm happy to show anyone who isn't used to it. I am in mountain time, and I do work full time, so though I get very excited and try to respond as often as I can, life does get in the way, and I can reply anywhere from a few times a day to once a week, depending. I'm also patient, I understand how crazy the world is right now, if you need a break, that's fine, if it takes you one, two, three+ weeks to respond I understand, just let me know you're busy, and I'll be happy to wait. And if you have no intention of continuing, that's understandable too! Just let me know and I'll do the same for you. \n\nIn this RP, I am looking for someone who feels like dealing with a great cast of characters - some can just be side or minor, I'm not trying to overwhelm anyone, but I enjoy writing female and male characters and I'd like to write both. Despite being in the Buffyverse, I'm actually not too much of a fan of writing canon characters; I want these to be of our own creation. That said, I don't mind having a few canon here and there, and I would be willing to either write as Spike or a OC for him. \n\nNow onto the story - the upcoming reboot has gotten me excited. This is very bare-bones, because I'd rather build the plot with you, do whatever the heck we want, with whatever characters we like. I know a little of the comics, but we don't have to follow those storylines if we don't want to. The idea is that it's now in modern times, 2021, and Sunnydale has rebuilt, somewhat, but it's the Slayer Organization that has built a new school, right on top of the old Hellmouth. This school is for new Slayers, Witches/Warlocks and Watchers to learn and train. Now we could have some OG characters here, but for Buffy especially, she's been gone for 15 years, sucked into some alternate dimension and presumed dead. We can keep her that way, alternatively she can come back for some extra drama, but that can all be discussed. Point is, there's potential for just about anything we want to do, and I have more ideas I'd love to discuss. \n\nIf you're at all interested, have any questions or concerns, send me a message and we'll go from there.

Lack of effort will be discarded.- All my roleplays are SFW only. - must be able to post a few times a week, preferably a few times a day - good grammar and punctuation - Discord only.\n\nCurrently I\u2019m only looking for a fandom roleplay filled with drama, romance, and angst! Please note that all characters are aged up to at least 18 at this point! Here\u2019s a list of fandoms I\u2019m looks for:\n\n**Fandoms:** we can discuss Avatar the Last Airbender, Disney Descendants, My Hero Academia, Harry Potter, etc. I personally do not play as a canon character nor do I double, but would like someone else to play as one (though not a requirement as I love original characters just as much). For Harry Potter, I would love to be able to play against Draco Malfoy in our own twist on the story. The other canon character I would love to play against is Zuko from Avatar the Last Airbender.",

            "selftext": "Hey! So, as the title says, I have two Medieval Fantasy OCs that I really love. In this post I'm going to share a tiny bit of infos about them and offer some prompts for each! Of course, if you have your own ideas, you're more than welcome to share!\n\nPremises: I think I can be considered a literate, or at least semi-literate player, I write in 3rd person and use past tenses. However, I'm not a native English speaker, so grammatical errors are going to be a thing. I really try my best, but if you're a person who loves pristine, correct walls of text, then I'm not the one for you, sorry!\n\nHere's my two characters:\n\nAINWEN: daughter of a dragon shapeshifter priestess and an elf who also happened to become a legendary hero figure, this adorable young girl is not only a dragonkin, but also a priestess herself. She lives in a big temple near an important capital city, but she also travels quite a lot for both political and religious reasons. She is 400+ years old, but is only around 11 in human years. She is very kind and polite, and she can really look like a wise and divine creature if she wants, but overall she's just a young girl who is super curious and loves to befriend humans.\n\nPrompts: Ainwen is visiting a foreign city, sent from the king of her country as an ambassador for some political matters. She either meets your character inside the royal palace, where she is staying for a few days, or in the streets, since she so desperately requested to make a small tour around the city to see how it looks like. As an alternative, your character finds themselves inside the temple she lives in for whatever reason, and therefore they happen to meet each other.\n\nARZHA\u00cbL TREMEUR: a half-elf of noble lineage, he lost his mother during birth and never really had that much of a relationship with his father, who eventually died of illness. He was supposed to become a proper noble and study the arts, or law, or become a tactician like his dad, but he's never been interested in such things. His real passion have always been weapons and war, he wanted to become a professional fighter. And he succeeded, convincing his father to let him become a knight and later joining the royal guard in the city he lives in. His attitude is pretty straightforward, blunt and sometimes even rude, but he's actually a good-hearted person who always ends up helping who needs it: being a noble means nothing to him and he makes this pretty clear with everyone. A loner by nature, he acts very awkwardly around women and children, since he doesn't know how to engage a proper conversation or relationship with them.\n\nPrompts: Arzha\u00ebl's country went on war against another one, and he joined the army under the orders of his king. He fought honorably, and his army prevailed. He meets your character on the battlefield, the fighting has ended only a few hours before. He's either helping to look for soldiers who are still alive and finds yours, injured, or Arzha\u00ebl himself is the injured one and gets found. Otherwise, the two can just meet in the encampment, or else. If his army was defeated, maybe Arzha\u00ebl has been taken as a prisoner and meets your character under these circumstances, or maybe he gets spared by your character for some reasons we can work on...I mean, the possibilities are so many!\n\nWell, if this confusing rambling made some sense to you, and you'd like to try and see how we can work together, don't hesitate to contact me! I'd rather for you to write me by reddit chat, after that I'll leave you my discord username :D",

I am Yuurei, 19 years old, and I've been roleplaying for as long as I can remember. \n\n\n- I would like my partners to be 18+. As the roleplays I would like to do include dark themes, I wouldn't be comfortable playing with minors. \n\n- Please, talk with me OOC ! I love to discuss plots, characters and the such ! I'd love to become friends. \n\n- I am not interested in adult scenes. Fade to black please. \n\n- I write a few paragraphs per response, please do about the same ! No one liners please ! \n\n- Canon x OC is fine, as well as OC x OC, and Canon x Canon too. I don't discriminate ! \n\nNow on to the prompts ! \n\nI'm interested in a mafia themed roleplay. I have a few ideas in how that would go ! \n\n- An ex mafia member, out on the street after being expelled from the family, ends up taking a job as a maid/ butler/ bodyguard for a seemingly innocent civilian. But is this person really that innocent ? \n\n- A young, hot headed adult thug joins the mafia, and a colder, more serious member is assigned to take care of his criminal education.\n\n\nThese are just a few ideas on how this could go, but I'm counting on you to develop something more personalized with me ! \n\nIf it isn't obvious yet, I'm a fan of the Yakuza series, even though I'm not even done with Yakuza0 - I'm open to nearly every suggestion regarding fandom roleplay for this ! \n\nAnyway, I think that's about it ! DM me if you're interested, I'm eager to meet you all !",

Get to know each other OOC \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Horror:** Elizabeth took the old tome in her hands. Feeling the worn down and dirty leather. The creases almost seemed to give the front an image of horrific face twisted in agony. \"It must be trick of the light\" she thought to herself. She could almost feel the eyes of her boyfriend stare just as intensely as the eyes of the book stared at her. Though a moment of hesitation struck her, she opened the book to a seemingly random page. The writing foreign, a language she couldn't recognize, seemed to be inked in a dark red that gave her the creeps. The image on the page consisted of a hand, rotting and obviously drawn by someone who's seen real decay, forcefully ripping through the earth. The wind shook the cabin, as if warning to close the book. \n\n*Inspirations: Evil Dead, Night of the Living Dead, Friday the 13th*\n\n*The general prompt revolves a couple staying in a cabin and finding a book that summons creatures and the couple's attempts at staying alive until dawn. Willing to change the gender of the significant other*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Adventure/Romance:** Aiyana was weary of the foreigner. His clothes were quite different. \"He looks rather pompous\" she thought to herself. She let out a sigh then glanced over at the chief, hoping he didn't notice. It didn't appear so or he just let it go. Something he wouldn't do for most but as his daughter, she often got away with things most wouldn't. She begins to nervously play with the leather bound shaft that served as a handle for her warhammer, the massive head resting at the ground by her feet. Just a week ago she was hunting a manticore and carefree. Now she was betrothed to man who stood before her father. She felt like a dowry more than a bride to be. Forced to marry a man to expand the mutual kingdoms. She heard he was a warrior of immense power. She took the hammer and banged it against the ground, it sends echos though the hall, interrupting the man as he talked of alliances. \"I do not consent to this proposal father\" she growled to the chief, eyes still on the stranger \"Unless he can best me in combat\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Two nations wildly different have agreed to a truce that would benefit all. Though it all hinges on the marriage of the Prince (Or Princess) to the Chief's daughter. I'd like the story to focus on the relationship building between the two as they encounter a fun adventure we can hash out together!*",

            "selftext": "All characters are over the age of 18. As must you be. This is non negotiable. There's nothing inappropriate about this prompt, as far as I'm aware.\n\nI want a rather light roleplay. Something cheerful. I want to play an alien female who has a big heart and a bubbly, but sarcastic persona. Who does have her sad moments, and things she doesn't like to discuss. But I want to play against someone a bit down on her luck. Someone who isn't happy, who may be close to something regrettable, who doesn't enjoy life, until a certain cheery alien comes and turns her life around. I'll throw in a prompt which roughly shows what I'm after, but feel free to bring your ideas to the table! \n\nThis roleplay is inspired by a song lyric. \"Nice to meet you, where you been? I could show you incredible things.\" \n\nIt was the worst day of her life and that was saying something. Being in education sucked for her. Bullied. Picked on, shoved, ignored. No one sat near her. In the corridors, she'd get shoved and her books stamped on and pushed to the side. Almost every night, she'd go alone and cry in her apartment. She just wanted to succeed. Good grades, even just making one friend.\n\nShe got sat next to, someone offering to be her friend, to get her hopes up only to tell her something vile and walk off laughing. But one day things changed, during lunch hour of a Tuesday, she was sat alone at lunch like she always was. \n\nA woman walked up next to her. She looked about her age but extremely cheerful. She looked very different from anyone she'd ever seen before. This woman had black hair and milky white skin. And bright, almost glowing purple eyes. She looked down at the poor, bullied girl.\n\n\"Hi! May I sit here?\" she asked innocently. \"I'm Brianna and I'm new here.\" she said with a smile across her purple lipstick lips. Smiling happily once she was allowed to sit down. The pale woman got a little book out and continued writing on it, but the writing wasn't in English, it was a foreign text, like some kind of coded text. More hieroglyphics than English. Her head was down and she was working when like a flash, her hand reached out and caught an orange than was aimed at the bullied girl's head. Without even looking, she placed it back on the table.\n\n/////\nSo that's it! I'd love this, at first, to be Brianna and your character meeting. You'd be the bullied girl, who slowly comes to trust her and is (pleasantly) surprised to find out her lack of earthly origins. Then perhaps the two could have a lot of fun exploring the best views together?",

            "selftext": "Three days. She\u2019d had the book for three days and already she was succumbing to using it. She\u2019d taken it, a possession of her family but nonetheless a stolen item she\u2019d acquired through less than righteous means for less than righteous reasoning. She could still hear the warnings of close relatives not to read through any of the pages, for what good ever came about from anything of such wicked nature?\n\n\nThe charlatan was keen on finding out.\n\n\nNimble fingers skimmed through the pages before finding her desired passage, blowing an errant coil of hair out of her face as she backed up to examine her work. There were symbols marked on the flooring of the cluttered old room with a black paste, materials forming a circle to hold whatever she\u2019d manage to summon. To find help was her goal, and if that coincided with involving a more questionable source, than so be it. She\u2019d need the assistance, for with the relic she carried and people who sought it- safety was no guarantee.\n\n\nThe words were written in a foreign dialect to her, but snippets of what she could understand were promising enough to her that she had a well enough idea of what she was doing. To summon a fiend was no simple matter, she knew, and still the words flowing freely from her lips felt as familiar as if she was reciting her own name over and over again. Her eyes flickered shut as she began the ritual, nerves frayed blending simultaneously with the buzz of anticipation coursing through her system. \n\n\nThis was the only way.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\nHello there! I\u2019m Mal, and I\u2019m looking for a plot surrounding the summoning of a fiend to make a deal with my charlatan. What kind of fiend? Completely up to you! They could be a cambion, one of the seven deadly sins personified, a classic demon, or anything else you might come up with. Setting-wise I\u2019m pretty flexible, and would love to write in a medieval/fantasy or modern setting, but I\u2019m definitely always open to other suggestions. \n\n\nI\u2019m in the eastern timezone and most active during evenings and early morning. My main writing platform is discord, and I can write anywhere from a couple of lines to a couple of paragraphs depending on the scene. I prefer third person, past tense, and am happy with either plotting out the story or winging it and seeing where we can take it. I have a bio for my character at the ready if it\u2019s requested, and I\u2019m more than willing to play some side characters to keep the plot moving. \n\n\nI think that\u2019s about it! I hope to hear from some of you soon (:",

I am a female in my late 20's but I mostly prefer to portray male characters involved in m/f romantic relationships. I write in 3rd person. I am located in the pacific time zone. I would have to say I am literate in the grand scheme of things, but stick to a couple paragraphs. There are times when I prefer more rapid succession vs novellas.\n\n\u00a0Regarding Fandoms I am currently interested in...\n\nThe Walking Dead: I cannot get enough of Daryl Dixon and I am willing to play against canons or originals, and at any time in the series that you prefer.\n\nPhantom of the Opera: Again, I have a soft spot for Erik. One of my old time favorites I could never say no to.\n\nMarvel: This can go in a variety of ways, but I would dabble in playing Bucky Barnes or Logan. (However I am behind in the MCU)\n\nYou can always suggest as well! Please DM me for plotting and contact information Happy Hunting.",

            "selftext": "Hi everyone\n\nI'm seeking a long-tern roleplay partner for AU fandom roleplays involving my OC in the following universes:\n\n\n\nCriminal Minds- Dr.Spencer Reid (Season 15, E4)\n\nDr.Spencer Reid was given one task by his psychiatrist, to have a normal conversation with a normal person that didn\u2019t involve talking about his work. Who knew one seemingly simple task would lead to more than he ever imagined? \n\n\n\nDC Universe- Clark Kent/Superman\n\nClark Kent has been sent to interview the elusive owner of a Fashion and Lifestyle company who was recently outed and choosing only to speak to one news outlet about her life and work, but as he learns more about her, he can't help but feel there is more to her than meets the eye, and it's not just due to his growing attraction to her.  What will he find out? How close will they get and will she find out his true identity?\n\n\nGrimm- Nick Burkhardt \n\nNick Burkhardt is wanting to take the next step with his girlfriend except there is one problem, he hasn't told her he's a Grimm. His last relationship ended miserably, once his ex realised what being a Grimm entailed and fears his current girlfriend will do the same. His plan to tell her is pushed quickly forward when he inadvertently sees and overhears her potential client talking to a Cupiditas planning to use and means necessary to make her fall for him. Will he be able to stop the plan? Will she believe him about her client? How will she take his news of being a Grimm? Will their relationship survive this? And is he the only one keeping secrets? \n\n\n\nBBC's Merlin - Prince Arthur\n\n\nMy OC is a visiting princess travelling with her father who is building an alliance with King Uther. She hits it off with  Merlin much to Prince Arthur\u2019s annoyance and dismay. She doesn\u2019t react to him like the others he has met before her, quite the contrary, she's outspoken and riles him up at almost every opportunity with her quick wit,  intelligence, and sharp tongue. She seems almost indifferent. Why is he so bothered by her growing friendship with Merlin? Why does he care that she doesn\u2019t seem interested in him? Why can\u2019t he get her out of his head? \n\n\n\nAs well as the following:\n\nOriginal ideas\n\n\nOne Night - The night of his best friend's going-away party, they drunkenly sleep together, him waking up alone, realising he's in love with her. They stay in touch throughout the years, neither ever mentioning that night, but never forgetting. He buries his feelings and finds love with a mutual friend,  proposing. His best friend returns to visit her ailing father and to come to his wedding having been invited by his fianc\u00e9. As they catch up, buried feelings start to creep back to the surface. Will they finally talk about that night? What will come out if it? Will there be a wedding in the end and whose will it be?\n\n\nA Family Affair - She is finally meeting her boyfriend's family for the first time starting with his father. Unfortunately for her, she didn't expect to see her ex come through the door having pushed him out of her head but not out of her heart. Seeing her was the last thing expected and even more so on his son's arms. He has questions and he plans on getting answers. He loves his son, but can he let him be happy with the woman he still loves? How will his son feel about this once he knows the truth? How will it end?\n\n\nOpen to more scenarios and ideas. I love a good brainstorm!!!  :-)\n\n\n\n*About Me*\n\nI'm over 21 and you should be too.\n\nI'm in the UK so GMT+0\n\nI only play on Discord, like being able to open different channels and add pics for reference.\n\nI'm on Discord daily so can post several times a day. I don't expect the same but please don't be the type that only post once a day or post and then days pasts before the next one. However, if something comes up in real life, just let me know, I more than understand.\n\n\nI write in third person and do variable post length tending to match my partner and if a long post is needed, such as changing scene, giving details, and/or sharing my character's innermost thoughts. I expect semi-lit and not fussy about spelling errors or grammar as long as I can understand what is being said.\n\nI do do doubles but it's best that I at least know the characters somewhat. In other words, don't expect or hope for perfection. I rather not disappoint. \ud83d\ude09\n\nRoleplays are centered around romance with elements of drama,  suspense, and some darker elements, how quickly things progress will be up to how we as writers naturally flow. \n\n\nI do like to chat about different topics with my partners outside of rp and am a good ear if someone needs to talk about something more personal. I do like to grow as eventual friends but if you want to just stick to rp, I'm happy with that too. No pressure.   \ud83d\ude00\n\n--------\u2010-----------------------------------\nAbout my character:\n\n\nAnyana Naomee Cross (with magick)\n\n\nAnyana was born with more than just a silver spoon in her mouth, as the daughter of a fallen angel and a witch, she was born a Nephilium with powerful magic. Her parents, Celine and Eramus, trained her as her powers became stronger, but were forced to stop after someone they trusted attacked her. Her magic defended her but at a high cost, killing her attacker and almost herself. Her parents made the difficult decision to bind her powers and changing her memories of having them. hoping if she knew nothing of them she wouldn't be able to access them. Taking another precaution, her parents transferred her to a small, elite boarding school where she was taught by the best teachers money can buy. \n\nAt 25, she is one of the richest people in the world, earning her money through her own work as a multi-talented designer and smart investments. She travels the world and spends more time on her private jet than at home. Her life is busy, but quiet thanks to her keeping her identity a secret and having specific people represent her. No one knows the truth outside her immediate family and closest friends until a rival of her mother finds out. Bent on revenge against her mother and a massive payday, she tells the press. Anyana's somewhat peaceful and private existence is in ruins, paparazzi following her every move and standing outside her home and offices. \n\nWith the stress of her private life now public, the bindings on her magic are deteriorating quickly. Once they are fully gone, her powers and memories will resurface. Will she be able to handle it? \n\n\n\nPowers \n\nAural Reading \nClairvoyance \nClairsentience \nHealing\nTelekinesis \n\n\n(W/O Magick)\n\n\nAnyana,  known by Anya to her friends, is one of the richest people in the world, earning her money through her own work as a multi-talented designer and through smart investments. She travels the world spending more time on her private jet than at her homes scattered in different locales. Her life is busy, but quiet thanks to her keeping her identity a secret and having trusted people represent her. No one knows the truth outside her closest friends until an ex betrays her after she broke up with him. Bent on revenge against her and a massive payday, he tells the press. Her somewhat peaceful and private existence is shattered with paparazzi following her every move and standing outside her home and offices. How will she cope and what can she do to ger a semblance of her normal life back.\n\n\n\nPersonality \n\n\nUnlike most kids born with silver spoons, Anyana is aware of the advantages she has over most, but doesn't use them unless absolutely necessary. Growing up with parents who cared less about money and more about making the world better, shaped Anyana into a sweet, kind-hearted child and later an independent, thoughtful, intelligent young woman with a big heart. Her kindness to those as seen beneath her however didn't endear her to the other rich kids, but due to her family's status and wealth, they couldn't bully her. It also didn't help that she had a wicked tongue that would put them in their place quickly when provoked. She had very few friends growing up, but that changed after she started up her business. She loves her job to the point that most would consider her a workoholic. \n\n\n\nIf any of the above interest you and/or have any questions, pm me and let get something started. \n\nMany Thanks for reading.",

Main thing I'm set on is wanting to play a dragon character (that can speak, of course, and no power fantasy either; Combat's not a huge focus.), but you're certainly welcome to play whatever you want that would fit the \\[ideally\\] fantasy setting we build together. I've got a few ideas for the premise of our story and world, but I'm open to suggestions and refinement.   \nI'm not really looking for a romance plot, but if it happens as a byproduct, whatever. I will not do NSFW.  \nAs far as requirements, I only ask the following:  \n\\-!!!  First and foremost, be willing to communicate your intent. If interest wanes or you become too busy, that is totally fine, but please let me know first.   \n\n\n\\- I'm not asking anyone to have complete linguistic mastery, but I won't be able to really engage with one-lines or writing that is marred by error to the point that the meaning behind it gets muddled. Don't overthink this one. I'm not the most practiced writer myself.  \n\n\n\\-Standard RP courtesy and all that, which I will be reciprocating. I'm not looking for power fantasy or wish-fulfillment, and neither of us are gonna do anything to take away player agency.  \n\n\nIf you've made it this far and are still interested, my DMs are open. Looking forward to a fun collaborative writing experience.",

            "selftext": "All participants must be 18+. \n\nMilwaukee, Wisconsin,\n20:32pm, 29th June 1998.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t supposed to happen like this, they weren\u2019t mean to be here yet- at all, even! An array of gunfire had been exchanged and the ground below them was riddled in ammunition; alongside the cars they had formed a line of defence with. If anybody was nearby they could most likely hear the persistent, booming noise, and that wasn\u2019t just the end of it because the sirens, and the alarm from the bank was still sounding out like a church bell on a wedding day. A woman slammed a magazine into her assault rifle, and blindly fired over the hood of the car she crouched carefully behind- hoping to hit \u2018a couple\u2019 of the police that halted their movement.\n\nShe had outlived her luck, though, and was shot in the shoulder during the process. Her rifle clattered to the ground and she collapsed against the car, panting harshly as her eyes were averted to the shoulder she had been shot in. It appeared the bullet hadn\u2019t gone through, but she was not entirely sure of whether there was an exit wound or not. She wouldn\u2019t have time to find out yet- and her eyes averted away again.\n\nA look and a nod to the other members taking part in this rough situation was enough to tell them that now they had to go. They returned the nod- three men, one younger than the other two- and two of them stood up and quickly exchange gunfire again. This time the police were the ones who had to take cover, and the group advanced back toward another car which was parked behind the building.\n\nThe car soon left with the four inside of it, and with the following police cars in quick pursuit. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nHey there! I hope you liked the above idea- I know that it isn\u2019t the best and isn\u2019t quite fleshed out but we can do that together! It\u2019s just the basics for now, but I\u2019m definitely interested in expanding and working with each other to make a good story out of this.\n\nI\u2019d like to note that I usually write in detailed paragraphs, and I would like it if you didn\u2019t message me if you aren\u2019t willing to put in the same dedication that I am. Of course, you may be busy- or you may have stuff to do and other places to be but please tell me if that is the case. I\u2019ll understand.\n\nI role-play on discord and Reddit chats, mainly. I don\u2019t really use PM\u2019s that much as they\u2019re hard to keep track of- at least in my own personal opinion. You will be playing as the younger individual who is apart of the heist group, and can describe him however you\u2019d like- either through your own words or a reference picture. I will do the same on discord.\n\n(Ladies- if you are interested in this idea then don\u2019t hesitate to message me either! I know that the prompt is specifically focused around a male but I am definitely not opposed to playing with a female partner. Thank you.)",

Due to his line of work, he carries a cold and standoff ish demeanor and will only crack a smile for his child\u2019s sake. Despite his closed off personality, he does have a soft spot that will only be seen if someone manages to break down his walls. \n\nMy character is a university student, studying child development, who just lost their job, struggling to make ends meet in order to continue paying for their school fees. Despite the struggles they\u2019re facing, they still have a very positive outlook on life and keeps their head high by spreading kindness wherever they go. \n\nAfter trying to make ends meet while also taking care of 3 year old, your character decides it\u2019s time to hire a nanny which is where my character comes in. \nBasically long story short; your character hires mine as his toddlers new nanny and as time goes by they get to know each other which develops into something more. \n\nI know this is not as detailed but I\u2019m hoping we can flesh everything out throughout the roleplay. I\u2019m looking for someone who is an advanced literate writer, who is able to write 2-4 paragraphs and only role plays in third person. I ONLY use discord \n\nWhat your gender is doesn\u2019t matter to me. However I am itching to do a m/m pairing, so if you\u2019re comfortable with that then great. I would just prefer to play as the nanny that\u2019s all :) if you\u2019re interested shoot me a message and we\u2019ll go from there. Thank you!\n\nAlso I\u2019m a college student and I work part time and babysit so I might not answer fast so if that\u2019s going to be a problem then this might not work. I\u2019m not a fan of people pestering me to respond every second of the day",

            "selftext": "Hey there fellow Star Wars fans! Hopefully this is something you may be interested in. Fair warning, while I love Star Wars I am not super knowledgeable on some of the more obscure lore (books/comics and so on) but I try my best. Regardless, this setting may not need some of that knowledge:\n\n**Hundreds of years after the Skywalker saga, Jedi are flourishing in the galaxy. The reign of terror the Sith instilled on the galaxy ages ago is no more. Instances of the dark side have appeared scarcely--although this was only a natural occurrence of the force. However, the dark side would never reach such intense scales as it had in the past.**\n\n**The galaxy has been out of balance for ages. It's only a matter of time until the dark side returns..**\n\nAbove is a short summary of what to expect in this roleplay. It has no set in stone plot, but one constant is that the dark side is going to return. Here's what I'm looking for in a partner:\n\n* Literacy. Typos/grammatical errors here and there are more than fine. I also don't expect you to be Shakespeare.\n* I am currently only looking to play a **Dark Side** character. However, this does not mean I am not willing to play other characters. I would not be opposed to maining a few light side characters, although I want the roleplay to focus on said Dark Side character.\n* 2-3 paragraph replies at the minimum. I won't stop you from writing more of course!\n* A handful of replies every day, at the minimum. Everyone gets busy, that's how life works--but I do love progressing the roleplay at a decent rate.\n* If you are expecting any of the characters that you know of from Star Wars, it's best that you... don't. The Skywalkers and everything to do with them and characters around them are more than likely long gone. This roleplay is focused on original characters with an original story about the galaxy and the state of it hundreds of years later.\n* This roleplay is going to be **long term**, so expect several months of roleplay (perhaps more)!\n\nThat's about it for now. Send me a message and I'll get to you ASAP. Thanks for reading!",

            "selftext": "Howdy y'all! So, I know you read the title of my post, and are 100% interested. Here's how to jump in! \n\nMy character is a fully realized person in the campaign in which she currently resides. Her name is Helix Lafey, and she is a little more than a little unhinged. She believes in self-sufficient success above all, and is Neutral Evil enough to actively obliterate those in her path to godhood.\n\nHowever, like all edgy warlocks, she wasn't always this way. \n\nOliana Alana was born the youngest of five to the king and queen of Seyalla, an island too small and too far from Faerun for any of the maps to include. From her position, the world sat under her feet, and her ~~undiagnosed Cluster B personality symptoms~~ less attractive qualities were disregarded as simple whims of spoiled royalty by all... except one. \n\nChildhood best friend, and, eventually, girlfriend, is the role your character would take. I only have two requests: She is also native to Seyalla, and she has the ability to ~~call out~~ smooth some of Oli's nastier character traits. Other than that, you have *full* control of her and her interests! \n\nIdeally, I want the girls to start as children (5-8), and grow up connected at the hip. Then, as they grow a little older (13-15), they realize that there might be something more than friendship there! I just imagine kids running on the beach turning into teens shyly holding hands as they walk the shore at sunset. \n\nOf course... this isn't the place for happy endings. One day, a tyrant comes to tear the beautiful little island to shreds and poor Oliana Alana is thrown into the helm, and resurfaces as *Helix Lafey*. \n\nI have ideas there, too, but we needn't get into that until we're actively plotting. \n\nThe goal is to bring Helix's childhood into vivid color so that she can be more rounded out as a character. \n\nNow... the technical stuff: I'm 23, and I'm not interested in rping with anyone under 18. There will be nothing beyond pg-13 before Big Bad Tyrant comes around. My rolling reply length is 1-4 meaty paragraphs; however, I will ocassionally write much more than that if the mood calls for it. I request my partner be literate and skilled with lyrical fantasy writing. It won't be used all the time, but mood setting is important to me! I try to be regularly active, but I work two jobs, so please be patient! \n\nOk... that's all done, so... if you're interested, send me a dm and we can get started! Thanks!!",

Fortunately through the divorce, you were able to get a large sum of money that would keep me well off enough for quite a long period of my life (possibly 20-30 years of being able to live from home comfortably).  I was prepared to move off to college when you hit me with this news, and convince me to stay with you so that you\u2019re not alone.\n\nI would love for this to turn into some form of seduction from you.  Maybe you\u2019ve loved watching me grow and develop into a young man, and you love the compliments I always give you and the way I look at you, but you want more. You want a lover, a partner, and you can\u2019t imagine it being anybody but me.\n\nThis could be as vanilla or as fantasy/exciting as you\u2019d like.  Please feel free to chat or PM me for deeper details on this.  Hope to hear from you soon!",

            "selftext": "Hello Role Play world! I am 22, female, MST USA and I work mornings to afternoons so evening rps are better for me. I am looking for anyone. I only require that your replies be a small paragraph, like 4 lines minimum. I'm not worried about grammar or spelling. I RP on Discord. I know life happens and things pile up so message me if you're super busy and don't feel like you can type a reply today but if you can't at least post once a day. Please be 19 or older! Thank you!\n\nI have this role play idea I would like to try out now. The world is going through something similar to the maleficent 2. The world is divided between humans and magical creatures. The humans are conquering the world and pushing the magical creatures further and further in the forest, killing them off and inslaving some. One of the stronger races of magical creatures is the Touroch, a dragon therianthropy race. The Touroch mostly keep to themselves in the deep mountains and forest but with the human kingdoms expanding they are waking up and taking action.\n\nYOU tell me if you want to be the princess or the Touroch.\n\nI have four oc options YOU can pick for ME to be in this role play. Touroch: Shiloh (male) and Valerious (female) Princess: Ava (bold and fiery) and Claire (timid and kind)\n\nIf you're interested, want to hear the plot, see my Oc's or have any questions DM",

I have also had more time to think over what I'm interested in.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI am still interested in the fantasy genre. Specifically, I'm looking for some more slice-of-life or relationship plots. I would prefer things relating to friendship, family, or close romantic relationships, NOTHING NSFW.\n\nI think that I would like being a bit of a gentle-giant; someone who looks fearsome, but is actually very wise and caring. I also would like to try out a plot where a character comes to me in need. Overall, I love the idea of just keeping up a calm, peaceful tone throughout. I'm not really looking for anything with a lot of action or big twists and turns, just two characters spending time together.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI'm looking for a partner who can communicate regularly. If something comes up or if you are unavailable at the time, please let me know. I am comfortable with anything between one-liners and full paragraphs.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI decided to try to keep this fairly loose, as I am willing to work with anyone who is interested. I would love to hear your ideas of what we should do!\n\nI hope you are interested!",

            "selftext": "Hello, hello, everyone! Albeit it a tad ludicrous and unprecedented, I have come to decide to share my own very first plot with you! Granted, do pardon me if it comes across as a little simplistic, yet, I do promise to expand on what I currently have if anyone comes interested in it! ( \u00b4 \u25bd ` )\n\n|\n\nHidden away in the darkest corners of the world, there exists a magical kingdom, one whose majesty rivals the heavens themselves. There, fantastical creatures walk through the woods and streets alike, relishing the otherworldly life the Kingdom of Xulux has granted them. \n\nThere, the wind sings sweet and courteous ballads, only to be matched by the very music of the bards that peruse each corner of the kingdom, bringing joy to all with the plucking of strings, the beating of the drums, and the eccentricity of their dance. \n\nSmiles and laughter all throughout, along with the distinct chattering between the townspeople, musing themselves with the troubles and amusements of daily life. Filled to the brim with joy, their radiance fits ever so perfectly with the candescence of the sun above, whilst the clouds form pretty little figures, as if it were for them alone. \"Even the gods wish to live amongst us!\", the townspeople say to each other, wondering how is it possible for any one place to be so perfect. \n\nFalling to their knees, the curious, wandering eyes of the children fall onto the shining armor of the guards, as they stand tall, lances in hand, awaiting the command of their captain, prepared to further continue their grueling training. Resilient, the devotion and love for their kingdom keep them from even blinking - for, their loyalty demands they sacrifice every single bit of themselves, so that the Kingdom of Xulux may never ever fall. \n\nClose to the palace, the arcane arts are demonstrated to the promising apprentices, fascinated by the mastery illustrated by their instructors. Poor and wizened at first glance, their teachers make sure they learn that which is most valuable - not everything is as it seems. Beyond what the eye can see, there lie mysteries, dying to steal away the oxygen in their lungs. \n\nAnd, lastly, up above. There is the tower of Xulux, where the princess herself keeps herself, tending to duties of royalty as the king and queen travel the world, in search for even more wonders to stash away at the Kingdom of Xulux. She looks down her window, smiling and waving at all that may wish to set eyes upon her, truly showing what a benevolent and loving queen she one day will be. \n\nDay to day, the bards sing away. Almost endlessly, their song has come to be an eternal one, singing their days and nights away. \n\nYet, one can only go so long without having the peskiness of doubt infiltrate their thoughts, just as the mind comes to question all that they believe to be true - all that they believe to be a reality. \n\nAnd, it can only be so long until one decides to see for themselves the utter truth of their world, if only to assure themselves their existence not to be a lie. \n\nIf nothing is at it seems - who can say that does not apply to the Kingdom of Xulux, as well? \n\nJust what secrets may lie behind such fantasy? \n\n|\n\nThat is very much it! As you can tell, this RP is highly fantastical. Thus, if that is something you may be interested in, do make sure to let me know! I would love to work out the details of this, so it can truly become something more than what I originally thought out! \n\nNow, here are some of my preferences when it comes to RP partners: \n\n18+ - As eighteen years of age myself, I simply find it a little more convenient if I were to roleplay with those that are around the same age as I. I am not completely against roleplaying with someone younger, but, do keep in mind that boundaries will be strictly discussed and set if so. \n\nPreferably female - Whilst I am not completely against roleplaying with another guy, doing so with a girl just makes it a little more convenient for me, as well. Similarly, I am not completely opposed to roleplaying with another man, but, boundaries will also be thoroughly discussed. \n\nSemi-lit to lit - Being one that tends to write quite a bit from time to time, and as you may be able to see from this post alone, I can formulate very extensive texts. I very much like it if my RP partner(s) have the same tendencies as me, but, this being a rather subjective matter, I would have to see for myself what my RP partner(s) can do. ( \u02d9\u25bf\u02d9 )\n\nIn regards to platforms, Discord is what I utilize the most when it comes to roleplaying. But, I am not opposed to using other platforms, if the need arises. \n\nThat is just about it for me! Thank you for taking the time to read this, if at all! I do wish to apologize for such long posts, but I hope this was elaborate enough to garner some interest! Do message me if this sounds like something you would be curious to roleplay! Have a wonderful rest of your day!  o( \u275b\u1d17\u275b )o",

            "selftext": "Hello! I recently read something and was inspired by it. This isn't based on what I was reading though, so don't worry about that.  \n\nThe basic idea is that, for no clear reason, monsters suddenly appeared in the world. These monsters are similar to those which you'd find in a fantasy book: Goblins, trolls, dragons etc.  \n\nThe human race was quickly annihilated, leaving only a very small percentage of people alive. Those who weren't killed immediately might've noticed that they could pick a \"class\", largely based on their life experience, with things such as \"wizard\" or \"warrior\" being available, though since they are based on your life experiences someone who has always been physically weak wouldn't be able to become a warrior. You typically get a couple of options for your class too, and you get to pick one out. They also had a status similar to one which you'd find in an RPG, which included levels and skills and such.  \n\nThat's basically it. I've got a couple more details but I figured I'd just explain them once we actually start talking. Apart from that I haven't thought about much more, so any additional worldbuilding will be discussed with my partner.  \n\nI don't really have any requirement for you or your character as long as you help drive the plot forward. I don't really mind if your character is male, female or anything else as I don't intend on including romance in this.  \n\nThe RP will be held on discord. If you find this interesting, feel free to PM me :)\n\nPS. I should mention that I plan on making this RP start when the apocalypse first happens, but if you have an interesting idea for another period in time this RP may take place then I\u2019m all ears!",

            "selftext": "\u2018In a world torn apart by the ancient wars of mages\n My arcane power is called a curse.\nAll my life, I\u2019ve been repressed by the Inquisition.\nYet I obtained the forbidden knowledge and escaped to the edge of the world.\nHere I shall build my spire of sorcery.\u2019\n\nGreetings! The above prompt is taken from the trailer of a game whose original premise has lingered in my mind, although the game itself eventually went a different way. I would love to write a novice magician (wizard, witch, something-mancer) who builds their cozy abode at the edge of the world. What your character is and wants determines where the story can go. Do you want to play an inquisitor, a fellow mage, a demon, a local noble, a dragon, a rogue, a sentient fungus? Go for it. We could be enemies, or uneasy allies, we could explore strange lands looking for resources to make our spire into a home, even change the world beyond.\n\nIn terms of my own character, I have a couple options I\u2019m considering, including a bureaucratic necromancer linguist, a highly practical cross-stitching witch who nevertheless is totally lost outside a city, a painter who is connected to an artifact made of gears that she seeks to destroy, a nature mage seeded with the soul of a sentient forest who might need help with retaining her humanity\u2026Is there any one which catches your eye in particular? Any of the main characters I\u2019d write would be female.\n\nIn terms of content, I should note that I\u2019m not interested in romance. In terms of dark stuff, there\u2019s content I enjoy and topics that are too much for me, so that one will have to be discussed in more detail if it\u2019s something you\u2019re curious about.\n\nIn terms of my writing style, I can be pretty descriptive, and generally average about 500-700 words per post, though can go lower or higher on occasion (generally lower if my rp partner writes GM-style \u2013 let me know if this is something you\u2019d enjoy, but is not necessary). I would enjoy writing with someone who can give me something to work with, helps me drive the story forward, and has a storytelling pace that is somewhat compatible with mine (one-paragraph or novella might not be compatible). In terms of posting pace, you should be warned that I am a fairly slow writer. A reply once every two days would be fast for me.\n\nI typically write on Discord or GoogleDocs (with OOC chat via Discord)\n\nPlease let me know if you're interested via Reddit private messaging (the envelope/letter icon). Reddit chat may be a bit unpredictable for me. Tell me about your ideas and, hey, writing samples are more than welcome!",

Foggy.\n\nThe floorboards creak slightly as a woman turns the corner, her face lighting up at your consciousness.\n\"You're awake!\" She smiles, walking over. \"Honey, I was so worried...\"\n\"W-Who are you...\" You mumble, rubbing your eyes as she joins you on the other side of the couch.\n\"Oh, I'm Jessica. You were telling me about something on my doorstep a little earlier.\" She giggles in a low tone. \"But when you got about halfway through, you just... Fell over and passed out from exhaustion.\"\n\"Did I look exhausted?\" You feel somewhat embarrassed by the ordeal.\n\"Oh, I was surprised you didn't drop dead even sooner!

Just a cup of hot chocolate , please.\"\n\"Just for you...\" She giggles, and walks off back into the kitchen.\n\nThis all feels... Dreamlike. Jessica, she...\nBefore you can formulate your thoughts, the woman returns, handing you a mug and sitting back down with you.\n\"Thank you...\" You mutter, sipping the drink.\n\"Mhm.\" She smiles.\n\nYou wanna say more than thanks, or something... But you feel kinda emasculated, to be honest.\n\"Honey, you're still shivering...\" Jessica giggles, and opens her arms. \"You need a hug?\"\nYou nod as you place the mug on the coffee table, feebly crawling over to...\"",

But I do understand that sometimes the reply doesn\u2019t have to be long. As long as it\u2019s not just one liners all the time. I usually play in 1st person. Hope you don\u2019t mind. \n\nI enjoy getting to know my partner as well. So we can add to the tension and chemistry in the roleplay. If you can connect off of it then you can connect during it. \n\nI am in the uk, so the time difference will be there. But I post everyday and I usually stay up late as well. So you\u2019ll always hear from me. If I can\u2019t roleplay or won\u2019t be on I will give you notice in advance of that happening.\n\nIf you want to discuss anything or ask me anything I\u2019ll happily go into more detail in private chat. I look forward to creating and building a world with you.\n\nI have an idea I have been looking to try or expand on :)\n\nHope to chat soon :)",

Talk to you soon hopefully!\n\n-------\nGrayshia: home for the Gifted, it is a self sustained, self contained, fully functional city. Complete with its own natural landscapes, businesses, medical centers, law enforcement, housing, and the main educational center, Grayshia Academy. It is a place for society's unique, human and non-human individuals. People who are gifted with abilities; Witches, elementals, sorcerers, magicians, demi-humans, and monsters. Although magicians and sorcerers use magic, the word magic is often misused by the general populous to describe any ability.\n\nMagicians or sorcerers are any one who can use magic, cast spells and use incantations. Witches are often confused with magicians because they commonly study the same class of magic, although witches have their own special type of magic and are skilled in alchemy. They use spells as well as curses, although curses are forbidden at the Academy.\nElementals are people who have an special affinity to bend or control the elements. Elements are basically defined as being water, earth, fire, and air. There are also sub elements that combine basic elements that people who have the affinity for, can learn. Most elementals are humans.\nDemi humans can be anything from a feline to an orc. And monsters from a pest to a demon. Demi's and monsters have their own races perks, in addition to having abilities: such as a demi-feline who has the abilities of a panther, but is also a magician.\n\nDue to the Grayshia's populous primarily consisting of ability users and demihumans, the risk for magic related crime and violent crime was increased dramatically. Therefore, aside from Grayshia's normal law enforcement, there was a special unit developed primarily for the handling of violent magic crimes. The Direct Action Ability Response Team (D.A.A.R.T) or Dart, was Grayshia's answer to the rise in violent magic crimes.\n\nMembers of Dart are highly skilled ability users. Dart has a variety of ability users to choose from when responding to missions. Although Dart is mainly law enforcement, their missions are usually classified and are not known to the public, and they are rarely seen unless there is a large operation. Dart primarily recruits from regular law enforcement, or from Grayshia Academy's work-study programs. Dart is considered Grayshia's militarized law enforcement. They have a strict ranking structure, strict rules and regulations, combat units, logistics and support units, as well as their own compound and training facilities. While there is no boot camp for Dart, there is a rigorous assessment and selection for it.\n\nFor Grayshia's more violent and dangerous of missions, Dart created subjugation units. These are the more specialized and elite combat units of Dart. A subjugation unit's primary role is the apprehension of dangerous or high valued targets. \n\nThis story takes place with members of one of the subjugation teams.",
