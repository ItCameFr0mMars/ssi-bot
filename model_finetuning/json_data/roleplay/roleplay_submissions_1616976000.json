            "selftext": "(There is a TLDR at the end if you don\u2019t feel like reading a wall of text!)\n\nI have personally been a part of a couple group roleplays, all of which have fallen out due to lack of interest or conflict. After taking a break from the hobby, I came back with the realization that you can achieve a consistently fun group with the right people .. which is why I\u2019m here!\n\nI\u2019ve decided to start a small, tight knit group of passionate, literate, and mature individuals that want to create something amazing, of which we can explore to our hearts content. There are many plans in mind for this group, but there are some important pieces to the puzzle I should mention. If you\u2019re interested in joining, keep reading :)\n\nThe genre of this world will be fantasy! This doesn\u2019t mean we have to fit to a formula, but we do want to aim for a sort of theme with how things operate. Obviously, since this world is custom, we can bend the rules.\n\nThere will also be somewhat of a phasing process to make sure participants will fit in with the group. I do want the effort to be inclusive, but there\u2019s a limited amount of space, and the risk of the roleplay failing, so making sure you\u2019ll be able to jump in is important. The basic requirements for this phasing are below:\n\n- Literacy is important. You don\u2019t have to be a novella writer by any means, but you should at least be capable of writing a neat, syntactic, and grammatically correct paragraph.\n- Under no circumstances will bigotry be tolerated. Essentially, if you aren\u2019t respectful of other identities, races, backgrounds, et cetera, you won\u2019t fit in properly.\n- You have to be ready to be challenged by others. A group will always be a place to share ideas and get feedback, but these ideas can be modified to fit the group, or even turned down if they don\u2019t fit. This doesn\u2019t mean you can just smack down someone\u2019s ideas constantly, either.\n- This isn\u2019t a world where you can do whatever you want. We want to immerse ourselves in a tone, so make sure you\u2019re adapting to it. \n- You don\u2019t have to sacrifice your real world time for this project, but activity and participation is very important!\n\nI\u2019m sure all this sounds rigorous, but if you\u2019ve been involved in one of these, you know how easily these things fail. The phasing process is only the beginning, and after that the fun can start!!\n\nTLDR:\n\nI\u2019m aiming to make a fantasy world with an inclusive, mature, and literate group!! If that sounds interesting, please feel free to send me a message, or leave a comment on this post! You can also send me your Discord tag, which is where this group will be taking place, so we can chat more extensively.\n\nI\u2019m so excited to hear from you guys! Thanks for reading!",

I roleplay in third person &amp; past tense, (semi) literacy being a must! Usually my replies are around 2-5 paragraphs long, depending on how thrilling the RP is ofcourse. Normally I\u2019m quite a rapid replier (hourly; with the exception of at night)\n\nGenerally, I roleplay as either Bucky Barnes, Jason Todd or Draco Malfoy. I\u2019ve been doing those three for years and I\u2019m very familiar with them. I also very, very, very much enjoy doing genderbended female versions of them, I\u2019ve been recently doing Fem!Draco and really enjoyed it, so if that\u2019s in your lane, definitely hit me up!\n\nUsually, I can RP with any character from any fandom that I\u2019m familiar with to make it work with my character, I also don\u2019t mind crossovers. In the past I\u2019ve done the most random pairings, and I must say those are often the most interesting RPs. I prefer roleplaying with canon characters, so no OCs please. Also, please be 18 or over :)\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in giving it a shot, please hit me up by commenting or sending an PM. I can RP here on Reddit, on IG or on Kik (and maybe Discord, if asked nicely)\u2764\ufe0f",

I have a character who I based on the American Civil War, she is a confederate soldier(in look only) and your character would be the union.  I'd like to work it in but I am looking for someone who doesn't mind playing a weird thing between these two characters.\n\nThe issue is that my character is hiding her gender for now because she was in the War.  Now that it is over, she is far from where she lives.  \n\nThere are guns but they are rare, so both of ours would have them.  I do want your character suspicious, even threatening to mine even though he is nice to everyone else in their caravan.\n\nIf you are interested, please have these:\n\n- Multiple paragraphs\n- Good world builder, working within my setting \n- Over 21+ because I am an adult.\n- Be okay with shipping\n- I do have a character image in mind for the guy, but I am open to others.\n- Be friendly OOC\n- Third person POV only",

Only rp on Discord :3. I got sometime almost all day, mostly in afternoon, so I would love to get several answers a day.\n\nNow about the roles... I don't have something specific in mind. We can jump into any  genre we agree, but I would love to add some romance on the story. ... Fantasy (my favorite): two bounty hunters going for the same creature? ... Real life: two strangers getting in the same taxi at the same time? A new neighbor? Meeting after a long time?... Sci-fi: Superheros couple or maybe just one of us and the other have no idea ? Harry Potter?... The walking death?... Star wars?( I don't follow alot of fandoms). Those are some random ideas but I would love to read your ideas too, we can mix any plots we have in mind.\n\nFeel free to PM me, I will be happy to get your text.

My oc for this roleplay will be provided to you if we do end up role-playing together \n\n\nI am looking for a boy x girl oc x canon roleplay, where I would allow you to play any female canon. I'm also available for double ups or even play multiple characters if needed.\n\nI don't mind whatever female canon you end up using for this roleplay, although I would prefer nobara or maki. All I ask is if you be patient with me.\u00a0 I understand that asking for a roleplay while not even having a oc for the fandom is a bit bad, but I usually like to learn about the anime and characters through roleplaying. It's what I've done with other fandoms, so I don't see why I can't with JJK. I can also try anyone if we end up doubling up or if we play multiple characters, as I can read up on them and such to get a better understanding of their characters and other stuff ^^\n\n I am quite flexible when it comes to triggers or restrictions, due to being at a mature enough age. So, if you have any triggers or restrictions yourself, please let me know about them so I can work around them. Same goes for plot ideas. If you have any, feel free to let me know! Also, please be at least semi-literate to literate if that's okay. That's just the literacy I mostly use.\n\nSo, that's about it. If you're interested, please comment below or message me.

            "selftext": "Year: XX47, Planet Earth has vastly changed, essentially becoming similar to a world in Star Wars, many different species of aliens live along with the humans, since the population has skyrocketed so nature has diminished in order to build more houses to accommodate, walls have been built around almost every city as a way of border control in and out of the city.\n\nIn the year 2020, In a underground laboratory, two subjects volunteered for a scientific experiment in order to create two super soldiers, unfortunately for both subjects they thought they would be signing up to serve their country instead the plan was to brainwash both of them in order to train them into deadly assassins, the laboratory was close to being shut down so in order to preserve their plan, both subjects are forced into being cryogenically frozen and hidden away from the world.\n\nSo now that we\u2019re in the future, descendants of the scientists found the laboratory and both subjects still cryogenically frozen, soon both subjects are thawed out and regained consciousness, continuing their training from the past to be brainwashed into assassins.\n\nMerle was sitting in his cell, he could hear scientists talking, he was shocked to hear that only one of us were to complete the training whereas the other will be terminated, he listened as much as possible and he found that he was the one that was going to be terminated. Merle waited until the scientists went home and lights were out, guards were patrolling as usual, he got out of his bed and waited for a guard to pass by, which one of them did, he managed to get hold of him and pulled him against the metal bars, hard enough to knock him out, Merle got the keys to his cell from the guard and unlocked the cell door, doing his best to sneak around towards the exit, he\u2019s spotted and the alarm is sound.\n\nHe manages to escape the underground complex to the surface, he had no idea what year it was or how much the world has changed, which is why he was confused and bewildered when he managed to escape, he began to run towards a highway with sounds of footsteps and dogs barking behind him, he manages to get onto the road and he runs towards the city, he had to jump off a bridge to try and lose his pursuers and when he does he ends up getting run over by a hover vehicle and subsequently he is knocked out by the collision.\n\nI\u2019m looking for someone who is over the age of 18, who is detailed in their responses, someone who is able to respond more than once a day, I don\u2019t want any one liners as they ruin the flow of the roleplay, I prefer to use Discord rather than roleplaying through Reddit messages.\n\nIf any of this interests you, feel free to send me a message through Reddit private messages, all chat invites will be ignored. In your first message send an example of your writing style then we\u2019ll move over to Discord",

I can be both literate and semi-lit depending on the person I'm roleplaying with and the roleplay itself. I mostly do romance types of roleplays and enjoy building up the story between the two people. I enjoy fantasy as well.\n\nIf there is anyone, preferably male, writers who are interested in roleplaying or have ideas of their own for a roleplay. Please feel free to PM!

            "selftext": "Hello all! I'm looking for a partner to create a roleplay with. A little bit about me ,I'm 24 from Louisiana and have been role-playing for 7 years. I can do 2-7 paragraphs depending on the roleplay and would consider myself literate. If you need any evidence of my writting,you can look [here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EZZ7XraorpDiK7w6oBi6pT4G_TR0-fz0v3LLtu2Gc9Q/edit?usp=drivesdk)I'm fairly active on most days but on days when im busy I will still do my best to get a few replies in. If I have to go for an extended period of time I'll let you know or if I'm not feeling the roleplay anymore,I'll let you know.\n\nI would like for my partner to also be literate. You don't have to match me line wise but I would appreciate creativity in your replies. If you have to go for a few days ,please let me know in advance. If you're gone for more than 3 days without a word then I'm just gonna assume you ghosted me. I want us to both be honest with each other so if you're not cool with the rp anymore ,please let me know and we can end things amicably \ud83d\ude01. I would prefer my partner to be 20+ in age as well.\n\nNow, for the RP itself. I want it to be a medieval fantasy world and I want us to make a plot from the ground up. We can discuss the lore of the world, gods, kingdoms,religions,etc of our world. Our characters can be any race we choose and you may also have more than one character you control. Romance is good with me so long as it comes naturally. I want this to be something long term that we make special. A world that we can have fun in because we made it the way we both wanted to. \n\nWith all that said,please DM me if you're interested so we can start discussing!\ud83c\udf89",

            "selftext": "Right now, I'm looking for two different things. Potential permanent RP partners and a few people to help me test a few characters I play that are giving me a hard time. They're characters I made to fill a \"student\" slot, but neither of them is very well-developed. One was made for a wanted advertisement, but the other characters in the family are not played and the backstory non-existent. While I normally write posts between 400 and 1000 words, the testing would preferably be IM-style.\n\nI have a large cast of characters and absolutely LOVE taking other people's wanted ads. Below are a few things about me:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I use animanga, drawn, or no face claims. I don't care what you use.\n* In terms of genre, I'll do anything but real-life, SOL stuff. Give me a little twist, and I'll be fine. Drama and darkness are up my alley. Too much sweet romance rubs me the wrong way.\n* Mostly looking for people to help me hash out the newer characters that are giving me trouble\n* I'm a 28-year-old female with around 15 years of RP experience\n* My fandoms include BNHA (which is where the OCs are from), HP, and a variety of fantasy fandoms\n* I play characters from 6-years-old up to a few thousand. Any genders or orientations are on the table.\n* I'm pretty slow when it comes to long-form replies.",

            "selftext": " I hope this post finds you well- I'm currently looking for a Roleplay partner for the plot I'll explain below. I am advanced literate to novella, and I am looking for my partner to share this writing style, as that's the level of detail I enjoy best; I think that will do the story that we're looking to tell some good justice. I do not Roleplay on Reddit. My timezone is GMT, however I can work around a whole myriad of timezones due to the fact that I'm usually up late- anyone from North America (which seems to be the vast majority of people) I can work around fine, due to previous experiences. SO, don't be too afraid about time differences. Now, some more specifics about the Roleplay, hm? I do expect my partner to be able to play multiple characters, we shall divide these between us, as we slowly and steadily form our own little band of misfits.. I'm not looking for you to play a canon character as your main character, just an OC; though I'd definitely think it would be interesting for us to play some canons, who would eventually join us in our journey.  I am particularly interested in an alien one, so we can explore the themes of prejudice against both of our characters, which very well may form a close bond. As for now, I do believe I've ranted on enough about the 'small print'- so on with the plot. \n\n14BBY- five years after the formation of the Galactic Empire, serving as a shock for the denizens of the gargantuan galaxy. The Republic has undergone numerous changes to become this new robust, governmental entity... but for most, life under the Empire- despite it only being half a decade, has become a factor of daily life. But for the Outer Rim? Well, some hermits are completely unaware of their existence! Just like the days of the Old Republic, this neglected stretch of the galaxy still was left to its own devices; subject to cartels, spice-runners and abhorrent individuals who would take advantage of the Imperial Army, nor the Stormtrooper Corps being around to stop them. Though, the planet of Mandalore... it was not a planet who escaped the Empire like its Outer Rim siblings. The Great Purge crippled Mandalorian numbers and culture- the wide majority of its people slain. Mandalore sits practically empty, with Mandalorian remnants scattering across the galaxy, away from their homeland which they now deem curse. Redaxion is the very same- a Mandalorian bounty hunter and mercenary who works in this deadly field to provide for his Clan; ever seeking Beskar for the foundlings. It just so happens the Empire have the most profuse collection of it, which places Redaxion under the ones who instigated a pogrom against his kind. Though, through means that is not apparent, Redaxion comes into contact with a woman... both are unware that their partnership will take them on an adventure that even the longest living Anazati could not achieve in a lifetime. Together, the two, and their slowly gathering crew will reshape the galaxy forevermore.",

            "selftext": "Altharen Valkyrie had always been the perfect Prince. From birth, he'd adhered to the rules and doctrines laid forth by his father, The King. With his charismatic personality and uncommon kindness, he was a Prince of the people... and all had come to adore him as they did no other. While it was true that he respected and obeyed his father, that wasn't to say that he was mindless... indeed, from a young age he'd taken to sneaking out of his bedchambers and into the library to read. He had a fascination with magic and legends that his matron did not approve of... and so this small act of defiance was all he could do to experience such wonder.\n\nNow eighteen years old, he had found himself desperate to read more stories and legends from the past... eager to explore worlds beyond his own imagining. Little did he know just how far that exploration would take him. As usual, he made sure to dress fully, on the off chance a guard did catch him... and slipped from his chambers and through the halls of the castle. Before long he reached the library and made his way quietly inside. For almost an hour he combed through the familiar bindings and titles, desperately trying to find one that he hadn't read before... something to hold his attention. That was when he saw it.\n\nThis book was black, with a spiraling serpent on the cover. No words offered a title... and when he opened it to the first page, all it had was a warning. \"Ye who dare to read from this tome in search of adventure shall find more than thine hearts desire.\" Confusing though it was, the Prince was undeterred. Flipping through to the next page... and read aloud... \"And so our journey begins at last, the warnings ignored, the die now cast... for whomever dare read this tome, shall find adventure far from their home...\"  \n\\-c-  \nAs the last word left him... The book began to glow. There was a picture there of a forest... and he was shocked to feel himself being tugged towards it. He couldn't scream, he didn't have time... as before the thought even crossed his mind, he was pulled into the book.\n\nWhen at last he awoke, the Prince was shook. It was sunset... and he was outside, in the same forest he'd seen in the book. He knew he wasn't dreaming... and knowing that magic was real, it didn't take him long to connect the dots and realize what had happened. There was a pond nearby, he made his way towards it... glancing at his reflection to make certain he was unharmed. The Prince of Elvaria was as radiant as ever... with bronze sun-kissed skin, matched with ebony black messy hair. His eyes, a pale and unyielding grey, were as captivating as ever. He wore his usual outfit.. A beautifully engraved white tunic with matching, form-fitting pants... and though young, he was surprisingly muscular yet lean for his age. He spoke aloud to make sure all was well... \"Well this is a strange turn of events...\" and heard the same musical voice that had enthralled so many of his subjects. He seemed well enough to move on... but where? Looking around, he sought any kind of landmark... or a campfire that might give him direction  \n\\---  \nSalutations! My name is 1b, avid RPer and longtime writer. I had this old prompt swimming around in one of my folders and was sad that it never got any use. I'd love to find someone to help flesh out the world that this young Prince lands on and figure out the crazy adventures that he goes on with another character(s) of your choice!\n\nSome ground rules:\n\nAs always, fun! Fun should be the number one priority between both parties. If you aren't having fun, I'd prefer you tell me why instead of ghosting as I\u2019d love to know exactly what went wrong in the exchange.\n\n18+ is a must just for me to feel comfortable.\n\nDiscord is another big must. I love discord in comparison to a lot of other mediums and it's the one I'm most comfortable with.\n\nLiteracy, literacy, literacy! I don't incredibly mind post length (barring one liners) as I usually adapt to match my partners in length. However! The bigger the posts, the better.\n\nThose are a majority of the big rules. We'll discuss more of character creation/setting and whatnot if we do decide to start RPing. If you are at all interested, send me a message on reddit. I'd love to discuss with you more in private. Add in the word 'Antithesis' in your message, just so that I can be sure that you've read this far.\n\nStay safe and have a great day!",

            "selftext": "\n\nHi! Gonna get a couple of boring things out of the way.  I\u2019m a 22 year old male on the east coast, and I write in third person. I tend to send out anywhere from 2-4 paragraphs per reply, and i\u2019m active on most days.  I\u2019d ask that my partner has some contribution to the plot, from worldbuilding to anything else! \n\nOkay, with that outta the way:\n\nHumanity succeeded their homeland. Colonies are established all over the solar system, with interplanetary travel, and the usual political disasters that come with big changes such at these.  From the Martian wasted, littered with ammunition cases and long-forgotten remains, to the Plutonian tundra, dotted with grimy neon cities. Humanity has done what it does best, by ruining its closest neighbors.\n\n\nIn lieu of this, potential still blossoms.  Companies all across the system have set up \u2018bounties\u2019, a way to weed out the undesirable in society! Any sucker can go out and register to poach, and maybe even get a decent sum of money with it.  This plot would focus around our characters getting involved with this very system, and the hijinks that come with it.\n\nTL;DR: A sci-fi group of bounty hunters set out to discover the solar system, and all the tragedy within it.\n\nThis plot is very barebones, though it gives us a lot of room to work with! I tend to enjoy using darker elements in a story, from disenfranchisement to full-blown conspiracy! Any suggestions or ideas are more than welcome!\n\nIf you\u2019re interested, send me a message and we can see if our writing styles work with eachother!",

            "selftext": "Hey there. I am looking for someone interested in a literate high fantasy or SciFi setting. I particularly enjoy political drama and world-building. However, I do also enjoy a good amount of combat/romance/drama to be present throughout the plot.\n\nFor Fantasy, I enjoy a setting which incorporated multiple races and has some magical elements. I particularly enjoy the DnD/Pathfinder and Warcraft races, but I am willing to hear more. I usually play these setting pretty open-ended and let our characters goals steer the story, however, I have a few ideas on how to start.\n\nFor SciFi, I mostly enjoy near-future SciFi settings, which are somewhat grounded and moderately realistic. However, I am not looking for a 100% hard SciFi. Some rough ideas I have for this setting are: Penal Mining Colony goes rogue, dystopian future earth, space adventure to complete goals, Mars v Earth war (both humans, focusing on cultural differences of the planets). This list is not extensive and I have more ideas if you want to hear more.\n\nFeel free to message me to discuss more. I usually prefer discord to chat I don't have a hard word count, but I do prefer it to be multi-paragraph for the most part.\n\nAlso, I am in GMT 0 (UK).",

I\u2019m 23, Central Standard Timezone, and female!\n\nMessage me with your age, timezone, and a sample of your writing if you\u2019re interested! **I will NOT answer messages that just say hey, hi, hello, or ask if I\u2019m still looking.**\n\nPartner requirements: must be 20 to 30 years old - Must play male - write in third person - 2+ paragraphs - SFW ONLY - must be able to post a few times a week, preferably a few times a day - good grammar and punctuation - Discord only.\n\nHere\u2019s a whole list of roleplays I currently have plots for:\n\n**Single Parent:** This is a work in progress sort of idea. Open to ideas and planning together. \n\n**Arranged Marriage:** Looking for a more modern to almost futuristic kind of setting, however, the two could be from places of varying technology and such. Though I could be persuaded into something more medieval. I would like to go the royal route with this, our characters being forced to marry each other due to a war ending or some other sort of treaty between the kingdoms. I would be more than happy to also have some more fantasy elements in this as well rather than bland normal humans. Give me mystical creatures, magic, etc. \n\n**The Selection:** Basically a slightly futuristic twist on the Bachelor/Bachelorette. One prince or princess comes of age and must go through an event called The Selection where they must find love from a specific amount of contestants. \n\n**Royal Mistake:** a prince from another country comes to America for school under a disguise and fake name, and falls for a regular American commoner.. It calls for big scandals if anyone finds out who the noble in disguise really is. \n\n**Fake Fianc\u00e9e:** Y/C and his fianc\u00e9e have recently called things off. There\u2019s only one real problem to this... He was supposed to bring her to meet the family at a huge family reunion/wedding/event of your choice. He resorts to calling M/C his college best friend or his best friend\u2019s slightly younger sister, maybe they\u2019re twins, idk.\n\n**Fandoms:** we can discuss Avatar the Last Airbender, My Hero Academia, Disney Descendants, Harry Potter, etc. I personally do not play as a canon character nor do I double, but would like someone else to play as one (though not a requirement as I love original characters just as much). For Harry Potter, I would love to be able to play against Draco Malfoy in our own twist on the story. The other canon character I would love to play against is Zuko from Avatar the Last Airbender.\n\n**The Contract:** two top young rising celebrities don\u2019t get along at all, for various reasons. What happens when their managers go behind their backs and set the two up on a date? Forcing them to sign a six month contract , claiming to be a couple in the public eye.",

I'm looking for a mainly realistic Zombie Apoc game, based on TWD but in a different place in the country to tell our own story. You'd be playing multiple characters, depending on how many you introduce, but I'd prefer to start off by myself right as the Apocalypse begins, perhaps at a college campus napping in my dorm between classes or something like that. If you want to add a female character at some point in the story for me to start a relationship with, that's fine",

            "selftext": "Hello there. I planned this prompt as a romance, in which Aphrodite would fall in love for Hephaestus. I would very much rather if my partner played a female version of the god, since it would be much more pleasant for me, but I will accept male partners and characters as well. In regard of Hephaestus' appearance, since there are many variations, I will leave this to my partner to decide. His looks, personality and traits are completely up to you.\n\nThe whole point of this story, is how Aphrodite changes throughout their marriage. And since we're talking about a prideful Olympian, this would involve lots of dramatic and clinic scenes.\n\nIf you're interested, DM me with your answer to my intro, and your thoughts on the prompt itself.\n\n-//-\n\nThe goddess walked through the halls. Her hands were shaking, and in her eyes, there was a fury with no relent. Olympus trembled, with Zeus's fury. The skies rumbled with thunders, a mere omen of the coming storm.\n\nAphrodite reached the main hall, and stared at the enormous golden doors, shut closed. She had ignored every tradition, every sign of kindness a wife could show to her husband, on the day of their marriage. There would be no ceremony, no feast and no guests. For her, this whole day was naught but an insult, perpetrated by her father. She didn't deserve this. She was an Olympian, for Gaia's sake! Why was she doomed to merry such a *thing?*\n\nShe was tall, as every other Olympian, reaching 6'8. Aprhrodite's hair was long, red and almost glistening waves. Her eyes were grey, and on her nose and cheeks, freckles marked her skin. The woman's skin was pale and flawless, and even in rage, her face was still undoubtedly the epitome of perfection. Aphrodite wore a long black stola, a color she only wore for the most dreadful occasions.\n\nThere would be no mercy for him. He was the cause of her ruin, the creature who would curse her with his presence throughout eternity. Aphrodite frowned, as she heard the heavy footsteps outside the palace, and crossed her arms. It was time to finally meet the monstrosity that would soon be her husband.",

            "selftext": "Hello, I'm a literate role-player, been in the roleplay world for several years. I'll go straight to the point: I'm seeking for new long terms partners to play out stories we can create together. (You don't say?!)\n\nI'm an experienced roleplayer and I can guarantee good post length (not less than one thick, complete paragraph up to three, four five... depending on what you give me, the part of the story we are on etc..), good grammar (although English is just my second language) and frequent posts (at least once a day.) \n\nI can play both male and female roles (currently searching for someone taking on a male role) and I tend to include side characters in my stories. Also please, if you are going to consider me as your writing partner, make sure to be able to handle one main character and at least one side character as well.\n\nSo do I have in mind? A good story, possibly set in the 70/80/90s (not a fan of super modern times.)\nBefore you ask, I'm also going to clear the doubt: the one in trouble would not be a female.\n\nAlso, I am searching for someone who would let me have a say on their characters, as I would let them do with mines. Catch my interest as a writer is fundamental to keep my interest alive.\n\nIf you are interested into hearing what my complete idea is about, and you are willing to keep your mind distracted with something during these difficult times, please, message me :)\n\nThank you!",

I watched godzilla vs kong on Thursday and now I'm interested in starting up a roleplay with it! \n\nThe details of the roleplay are entirely up too you! Is it about monarch agents post skull island looking to find the titans scattered about the world? Do we live in a world of mega corporations racing to find new ways to prevent titan attacks in the world after godzilla vs kong? Who knows but we can talk! I am leaning more toward a roleplay where we can take some creative liberties, make our own monsters and corporations and play with the canon a bit\n\nFor myself, romance elements are not required and if it happens it happens. I can write a few sentences or a couple paragraphs but I'll mostly just try and match your lengths. I'm not picky when it comes to partners, english is hard, but just be literate enough to say what needs to be said. Although more advance literate are also always welcome",

Well, your beautiful idea(s)! Okay okay, let me explain. I\u2019m looking for something in a **Fantasy** setting. Can be **Modern**, **Medieval**, or anything in between. However, I can\u2019t really decide on anything too concrete. That\u2019s where **you** come in. \n\n**What I am looking for**\n\n- Bring me your fantasy idea(s)! If you have an idea, big or small, that you\u2019ve been wanting to try out here\u2019s your chance! I love world building and would love to help you with your idea(s). If you\u2019re idea is not something that interests me, I\u2019ll be sure to let you know. Romance is preferred, but optional. **No Fandoms**\n\n- F 18+, around my age (22). \n\n- Can usually reply more than once per day. As always, this varies and life always takes precedence!\n\n- Minimum paragraph response. I usually try to do at least two, but quality over quantity!\n\n- OOC chat is necessary with conveying ideas and working with each other better. \n\n- Your favorite band/artist! That\u2019s the only way I\u2019ll know you read this far.",

I'm totally hooked. It also so happens that I love the idea of kids with special abilities being taken and experimented on so if I could find a like-minded person to rp with, that would be awesome. \n\nIf you haven't read the book, don't worry. The characters in the book are very young, so I'm not looking to use canon characters and I also haven't even finished the book. What I do want to do is write teenagers with special abilities trapped into a facility where they are being experimented on for reasons unknown to them. This would have some kind of horror elements to it so keep that in mind! \n\nSince we would be mainly writing teenagers that means this will remain clean. Romance is fine though, highly preferred even and I mostly write male characters against other males. Of course depending how big the story will be and how many characters we manage to fit in, I am not against including adult relationships too.",

            "selftext": "Hi reddit!  I'm looking to get back into the swing of RPing again, and was hoping there might be some people out there who'd be interested!  A few details about myself: I am 30+, male, and mainly write in multi-paragraphs and prefer Discord as the RP medium.  I also am someone who is most concerned with the story making \\*sense\\* - if that means there's romance or more, so be it, but if it doesn't make sense then I won't do it.\n\nAlso, I'm looking for someone 18+ to RP with - since the story might take an adult turn (though it doesn't have to!) I just want to be safe.\n\nI've been RPing for a while, and tend to write in third person, paragraph style.  As mentioned, I prefer Discord, but could be pursuaded to use Google Docs or some other media if you try hard enough ;).  I can reply at least once a day, sometimes several times a day if it's a weekend or I happen to have time.  I am EST, and tend to be most active in the evening!\n\nThe idea you will see below is one I've started on with several partners, but unfortunately many of them had to drop the project due to real-life issues.  I'm really hoping to actually complete this RP with someone so I hope you can stick around!  If you're more in the market for a short-term RP engagement, I'm probably not your man, sorry.\n\nNow onto the actual fun stuff!\n\n\\* The Grain Merchant's Son\n\nKaha'an hadn't always been known as the City of Lies. Before the Rending, it was the capitol of the Balishan Empire, crossroads to the East. It was still those things. Except now, Balisha was an inhospitable desert, the East now seemingly further away than ever, and the city itself much changed since those innocent days.\n\nWith the presumed death of the Emperor, the great Merchant Cartels had seized de facto power in the city. Primary among them were the Big Four: the Grain, the Water, the Iron, and the Slavers. Xion Kemvimore was a minor scion of the Grain Cartel's Kemvimore family. He had little besides his name to distinguish himself - he was not especially skilled nor particularly favored in his house.\n\nEven his looks were average; neither too tall, nor too short, at only a few inches below six. His sandy brown hair did not stand out much either, nor did his green eyes. They were not sea green, or emerald green. They were just... green. In fact, if it hadn't been for a singular incident, he might have been completely forgotten by history.\n\nMinor requests between the Cartels were usually handled by messenger. Or, as was the case with the Kemvimores, by lower-ranking members of the family proper. That particular tradition served two purposes. First, by becoming useful enough, one might rise in the family's estimation. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, it cut down on expenses. On his way back from one such dispatch, Xion Kemvimore noted something peculiar. The Arol Batae complex seemed in an uproar.\n\nThis was unusual for two reasons. First, nothing ever seemed to bother the stoic Arol Batae. Second, seemingly no one ever entered or left their facility. Still, Xion figured it was none of his business. After all, no good ever came from interfering with the stone-faced Arol Batae. He swiveled on his heel, preparing to return to his family's house.\n\nAnd that was when he met her.\n\n\\---\n\nSo!  Perhaps you're wondering who exactly Xion met (and who the Arol Batae are).  The Arol Batae (which stands for \"Old Guard\") are the royal guard of Balishan kings.  I took some inspiration from the Praetorian Guard of Imperial Rome for their general concept and design.  When the Rending destroyed Balisha and killed the King and Queen, the Arol Batae were permitted to keep their fort in the Royal Quarter, where they stayed quietly for the last eighteen years.\n\nAs it turned out, the reason for all this was political - the Emperor's one remaining blood heir, a young princess, was in fact still alive.  Most presumed she'd died in the Rending with her parents, but in fact she'd not been with her family during that event.  Having failed to protect the King and Queen, the Arol Batae decided to cover up all evidence of the princess's existence and keep her in the facility where anonymity could shield her from those who would wish her harm.\n\nTechnically speaking, since the King's body was never recovered, he is only \\*presumed\\* dead; no official declaration had ever been made.  Thus, the Kaha'ani throne sits empty.  Being too young to actually ascend that throne at that time, the princess would inevitably have been influenced by the Cartels - perhaps even convinced to step down.  And so the Arol Batae decided they would keep her a secret until such a time as she was old enough to ascend.\n\nIt may seem somewhat cliche, but yes, the rebellious princess escapes her \"captors\" (and as you've probably guessed by now, she's who Xion meets).  Though in this case, her captors truly did have the best intentions, and was only trying to protect her from the ruthless backstabbing politics the merchant cartels regularly engaged in.\n\nNow one last thing I want to note here (kind of important): \\*\\*the princess in this case was raised by the Arol Batae\\*\\*.  The Arol Batae are soldiers, first and foremost.  She would certainly be closer to Xena, Warrior Princess than Princess Peach - while the Arol Batae certainly meant well, they raised her as one of their own because that was all they knew.  As for how she gets along with Xion... who knows?  Perhaps you and I could find out!\n\n\\---\n\nIn any case, if this strikes your fancy, please contact me!  I've also got a few other ideas but I didn't want to make this post super long.  We can discuss them later if you want!  You can either PM me (which I would prefer), or reply to this post (I might be pretty slow in replying though), and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.  Thanks for your time, and happy writings!",

            "selftext": " \n\nHello,\n\nLately I've been trying to find an RP partner to do a multitude of ideas I had, or even what you guys reading this might have had; However, I've noticed there's a high demand, and yet, a short supply. So, before I get into this I just wanted to say I'm quite sorry for the rather informal nature, however I wanted to apply a much more personal touch as to imply my personality. A tad about myself really quick; I've been Roleplaying since around 2012, 2013 (so however long that's been, I don't really know,), and I live in Central Canada and predominantly follow the said time zone. If you live in Europe or nations that aren't in North America, please don't let this deter you as I am more than willing and able to adapt to most time zones across our planet.\n\nIn regards to what I'm looking for in Roleplay, I'm truly up to most topics. I'll put a standardized list below to make it easier, however I can be talked into most things. Just please keep in mind, I prefer stories to include rather dark and gritty elements, which range through controversial topics *which do not reflect my personal views.* I just find stories that stay more gritty and grim to be much more entertaining and enjoyable, as they tend to truly highlight the flaws in modern society.\n\n**Loves:**\n\n\\- My Cyberpunk World\n\n\\- Alt History Stuff\n\n\\- War Based Plots\n\n**Likes:**  \n\\- Slice of Life (Modern)\n\n\\- Light Fantasy (We'd have to talk about this one\\*)\n\n\\- Apocalyptic\n\n\\- Other (Can't think of everything)\n\n**Neutral:**\n\n\\- Medieval/Renaissance Era\n\n\\- Historical Based Stuff\n\n\\- Sci-Fi\n\n\\- Other (Can't think of everything)\n\n**Dislikes:**\n\n\\- Heavy Fantasy (think stereotypical DnD)\n\nPlease note, I am up for most things and I'd be willing to discuss everything with you. So, with that being said please feel free to send me a message and hopefully we can get something going!",

            "selftext": "Hello!  I had this little idea where we\u2019d make an original fantasy world, but  unlike many other rps, we will actually follow the entire life of our  characters. We\u2019d start the rp at their birth and then follow them until  they inevitably die. I\u2019m hoping for this rp to allow for lots of  imagination and not be very restricted, though we\u2019d make some ground  rules and such.\n\nNaturally, this  will be a long term rp. It will most likely end once our characters die,  though we can always make a new world or something and then let the  characters reincarnate into that world in order to follow them  throughout several lives while keeping the same characters.\n\nAs for requirements: As long as there\u2019s something for me to go off of in your posts, anything is fine. You also need to be alright with the fact that this won\u2019t feature romance, at least not between our protagonists, as I suck at it.\n\nThis rp will be held on discord.

I tend to send out anywhere from 2-4 paragraphs per reply, and i\u2019m active on most days.  I\u2019d ask that my partner has some contribution to the plot, from worldbuilding to anything else! \n\nOkay, with that outta the way:\n\nHumanity succeeded their homeland. Colonies are established all over the solar system, with interplanetary travel, and the usual political disasters that come with big changes such at these.  From the Martian wasted, littered with ammunition cases and long-forgotten remains, to the Plutonian tundra, dotted with grimy neon cities. Humanity has done what it does best, by ruining its closest neighbors.\n\n\nIn lieu of this, potential still blossoms.  Companies all across the system have set up \u2018bounties\u2019, a way to weed out the undesirable in society! Any sucker can go out and register to poach, and maybe even get a decent sum of money with it.  This plot would focus around our characters getting involved with this very system, and the hijinks that come with it.\n\nTL;DR: A sci-fi group of bounty hunters set out to discover the solar system, and all the tragedy within it.\n\nThis plot is very barebones, though it gives us a lot of room to work with! I tend to enjoy using darker elements in a story, from disenfranchisement to full-blown conspiracy! Any suggestions or ideas are more than welcome!\n\nIf you\u2019re interested, send me a message and we can see if our writing styles work with eachother!",

I only use past OCs with the partner I made them with :) \n\nI'm looking for romance roleplays. I enjoy FxF, MxM and only FxM if we have good roleplay chemistry. A particular favorite of mine is toxic relationships, but I am also down for wholesome fluff just for fun haha.

Lately I have been looking for a slice of life  role play to do on Discord. The story will include elements such as : romance, adventure, drama... but we can add many other elements as well. I do already have a couple of ideas in mind but we can adjust them or figure out something new together according to our mutual interests. I also like to include some secondary characters although the story will focus mostly on our own ones. Here\u2019s a little bit more about me : I\u2019m 19, I\u2019ve been role playing since several years and I write in descriptive and detailed paragraphs. In order to role play I use only third person and I write in past tense. Everyone is welcome to text me if interested but if you are European it\u2019d be a huge plus due to the possible time difference. I will try to be as active as possible but, due to working, there\u2019ll be times where I\u2019ll be busy. In case there will be a big time difference between our countries we can figure out a solution together and find a way to organise everything. Don\u2019t hesitate to contact me if you think we could be role play partners. Have a wonderful day ladies ! :)",

            "selftext": "(Hey there! Trying this again! I'm Leo, 23, and I have this idea for a long-term roleplay! Generally it's quite like My Hero Academia or X-men, a school for gifted children. I'm going to be the GM meaning I control the environment and every other character, and you're your character, and your decisions influence the world! Just because I'm the GM doesn't mean you don't have control. If you want to make up anything, feel free to do so. I'm descriptive myself as you'll see from reading the prompt below and I expect my partner to be descriptive as well, between 150-300 words a response. I will be writing in 3rd person as I am not any of the characters, I don't mind if you write 1st or 3rd. This is supposed to be a long term roleplay, and we'll agree together on where to continue.  \nIf you are interested, please message me via the reddit chat with your character idea, this should include their power, appearance etc. Please do try and make the powers with some setbacks, so it's more satisfying later on trying to overcome them.)\n\nThe Dalerra Academy for Metahuman Superhero Training, or more commonly known as the Dam, is one of the most prestigious schools in the country, known for taking in only the cream of the crop, those young hopefuls with the highest potential, in order to get them prepared for what awaits them after they're 18, a life of fighting crime. It sounds exciting, I mean how can it not be? It's a school where they teach you how to fight, hone your abilities, and be the best version of yourself possible. But being a superhero isn't all fun and games actually, it's a lot of hard work. Between being mindful of structures and civilians, having to maintain a good social presence, knowing how to work together with other heroes, learning how to get signed into the right agencies, it can be stressful too. Oh and of course you put your life on the line every single day, that's there as well.\n\nBut still, if there was ever a place to come learn how to be a superhero, it would be here. Scarlet Dalerra started this school twenty five years ago, so it doesn't have much of a storied past, but it quickly surged to the top of the rankings, due to its incredible staff, facilities and the leadership of Ms Dalerra. She herself, a former superhero, has made this place her life project, and she couldn't be more proud and protective of it.\n\nOut in rural Massachusetts, five large buildings on campus make up the school. Like any high school, the students are split into freshmen, sophomore, juniors and seniors, all together there are 250 students in the whole school. Not all of them finish their education here, some drop out, some are kicked out, and some can't take the pressure, and leave. But you know that you won't be those people, you know that this is where you belong, where you're supposed to be.\n\nThe exams were difficult, both physical and mental, testing your strengths, your weaknesses, both physical and with your powers, but you proved yourself worthy, and got the admission letter that you were waiting for so desperately. This was your way to make it big, you knew it, if there was a place, it was at the Dam, and you'd be around so many others like you, metahuman, every single one of them unique and powerful in their own ways.\n\nAnd then that day arrives. The first day of school. The nerves start setting in, you feel the lump at the back of your throat, and it won't go away. You pack what you have in life in a suitcase and when you reach the school, you find the other freshmen, starting to line up in front of a small desk, with a smiling, pink haired woman behind it. She seems to be checking names, and handing out bags and keys, you assume dorm room keys.\n\nThere are about fifty students standing in line, it seems to be moving quite slowly from what you can see. You can see your first glance at your soon to be classmates, and hopefully friends. Some are bigger than you, some smaller, you can spot one boy playing with a deck of cards, flashing parlor tricks in the hopes of wooing a girl who seems unimpressed with him. There are many faces in the crowd, a couple that you recognize even from your exams.\n\nYour journey starts here. The journey to become a superhero.",

I\u2019m 18, somewhere in the CET timezone. I prefer writing in third person and tend to adjust my text length to my partners. right now I\u2019m more in the mood to write shorter texts, because it keeps the story going. that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019ll be effortless or without details though. I can use either discord or reddit to rp. \n\nsome things I\u2019m asking for: please be around my age and a pinch of effort in the first message/introduction. I\u2019ll be honest, I don\u2019t really know what to do with \u201chey wanna rp\u201d so just one or two more sentences and I\u2019ll be forever grateful. \n\nAnyway if you have some questions or this caught your attention in any way, feel free to send me a pm. Have a great day/night!",

            "selftext": "Hi! I'm Ari, 21 years old, Male, and am looking for some new RP partners! Currently I'm very much into Final Fantasy VII and would be happy to RP either in that universe, or take the characters out of their universe and place them into a different setting if you prefer. I don't mind OCs, and have a few of my own, but unless specifically asked about them I tend to stick to canon characters. I'm specifically hoping to RP Cloud!.\n\nI've finished both OG and Remake,. I've seen ACC and read the novels localized by Yen Press.\n\nThe type of partner I'm looking for is someone who is:\n\n- Not a minor\n- and knows how to push a rp forward. Just don't give me a reply like \u3010\"Haha, sure.\" He said.\u3011 &amp; we'll be good\n\nTypes of RPs I'm interested in:\n- Romantic (my otp is **Sephiroth/Cloud**, but I'm also down with Reeve/Barret, Reeve/Vincent, Barret/Vincent, Vincent/Cid, and Zack/Cloud to name a few. If you want to suggest a different ship, do note that while I only do M/M ships\n- Fight scenes\n- Slice of life\n- Plot based\n- Short\n- Long\n- One character per partner\n- Multiple characters per partner\n\nIf any of this interests you, feel free to enter my DMs! \nWe can then trade Discord Details!",

            "selftext": "Hello there good people of Reddit. I\u2019m once again here to annoy you with my sheer presence, and ready to be ignored completely! My name, if you did not know already, my name is zero. Yes that\u2019s my name, feel free to ask. I\u2019m 19 years of age, I am in university right now and i aim to become a vet one day. I tend to roleplay lesbian roleplays, that have romance, fantasy and some action in them and that\u2019s what I\u2019m looking for. I am a semi lit to lazy lit, depending on the situation at hand and I hope that you are that or above. Now onto the actual plot of this roleplay. So the world is set in one where animals (think dragon maid or monster musume) live together in harmony. Humans walk among these monsters, and they walk among man. Although they live in harmony, a lot of things are still human based and preferred, especially a lot of entertainment and political stuff is mostly human. One industry specifically doesn\u2019t have anything with monsters in it. That\u2019s the music industry. Until the band, the sirens, was made. It\u2019s an all monster band, and it\u2019s the only one of its kind. Your character, who can be anyone in this case (human or monster alike) but you have one thing that is required (except that the character is also female of course) is that your character is an adoring fan of the sirens, specifically the lead singer. You listen to all their songs, you have all their Merch and such. But you never got to see them love or meet your idols. Until you won a lottery, where you got to go, with a front row vip ticket, to see the sirens play live. You expect everything to go as normal, which it does, but after the concert is where it gets strange. You see the band head down into the sewers after the concert. So strange, so mysterious. But, as you are so curious, you decide to follow them down... that\u2019s all the information I\u2019m giving on that. Now then, if your interested, please give me a dm so I can give my discord or work things out on Reddit. Have a good night/day everyone",

Let\u2019s work towards those scenes. Let\u2019s focus on building up a story together, developing characters, and just have fun being creative together! \n\nI do multiple replies a day but I understand if you can\u2019t do that. Life gets busy. I\u2019m on CDT time and I\u2019m mostly free to role-play in the evening or at night. \n\nHopefully one of my roles peaked your interest. I can\u2019t wait to hear from you!",

            "selftext": "I hope this won't break any rules, sorry. \n\nAnyway! I just made a group rp! It's about the Dark Academy of Evil, where teenagers and young adults go to learn how to be the best assassins and gang members in the world! \n\nThere are so far four mafia gangs represented at the school, and the loners. \n\nA description off the gangs:\n\n\ud835\udc79\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc97\ud835\udc86\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc94\n\nThe Ravens are an American gang, they are known for their special way of murder. No matter what, the police can never seem to figure it out. All they know is the burned raven like wound on the victim's chest. The gang is not family ruled like the other ones. It's ruled by the most powerful one in the gang. The leader can always be challenged and has to accept. The winner of the challenge will then become the leader, and the loser has to pay with their life. This gang started in 1921, the founder lost all of his money during the great depression, instead of taking his own life, he decided to use his contacts and founded Ravens. \n\n\ud835\udc6d\ud835\udc8d\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc8e\ud835\udc8e\ud835\udc86 \n\nFlamme is the most powerful French mafia. They are inside all the important places in France. Everything from politics, business, even the police. Flamme is a family-ruled gang, but the family doesn't always mean by blood. If a member gets close enough, and shows they are more capable than the family, they'll let the most capable as the next one. This old mafia has been lead by the Flamme family since 1902.\n\n\ud835\udc73\ud835\udc96\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc85\ud835\udc86\ud835\udc83\ud835\udc86\ud835\udc93\ud835\udc88\n\nThe Lundeberg\u2019s was founded in 1812 and is the school's oldest mafia. This Nordic gang has spent most of their time in Europe. They control the economy, laws, and general tops of their countries. This, however, doesn't stop them from killing whoever gets in their way. This family has many important roles that need to be filled. The only thing they require is that the recruit has gone to the academy.  However, do one mistake, and they will kill most of your loved ones, and let you suffer until you choose to take your own life.\n\n\ud835\udc02\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc1a \ud835\udc02\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27 \n\nLike most of the Italian mafia, this one is all about honor. Everyone that makes a great man loses his face, will suffer horribly. The gang was founded in 1904. With the bare eye, it doesn't seem like they have a lot of power, but underneath is where it all happens. They are all about honor and keeping a low profile. All their contracts are secret. What one knows, no one knows. What two knows, everyone knows. \n\nWhich one will be your new family? Or will neither?",

I like to play OCs in third person and usually aim for about a paragraphs worth of detail per response. \n\nSome fandoms I feel as though I am knowledgeable enough about to comfortably roleplay are:\n\nRWBY\nCyberpunk 2077\nLeft 4 Dead\nThe Last of Us\nDestiny\nSkyrim\nFallout\nMirror's Edge\nStar Wars \n\nAlternatively, I'm also down to work on something totally original, be it fantasy, sci-fi, or even something a little more grounded in reality. I'm mostly interested in a story-focused plot, although romance is on the cards as well.\n\nI am 18+ and all characters and participants are 18+ as well\n\nHope to hear from you :)",

My name is Alexander though if your prefer you may address me by Alex either one whatever suits you. I live in the untied states, and have a full time job. Given that I mostly tend to rp during the later hours or early mornings though I always make sure to put out five replies or more per day given. And always inform whomever I\u2019m working with of my leave just don\u2019t like to disappear out of nowhere. Not fun also on that not no ghosting just wanna get this out of the way. If you have a tendency to do so please turn away thank you. Okay and reply length I normally for four three to four paragraph and absolutely no one liners. Please they are just really difficult to work with. That\u2019s all I ask for in that much. Plot wise I tend to stick with fantasy or romance though I am perfectly open to your ideas I\u2019m always looking forward to try something new! I rp on discord it\u2019s in the title just the easiest for me. And if we match we can talk more there but start on Reddit of course. I use my own Ocs nothing from fandoms just isnt my style. If this matches anything you have in mind shoot me a message!",

I have 5 years plus experience. I am up late due to work and I\u2019m an early riser. I roleplay mostly male but I\u2019ll do just about any side character we add into the roleplay. I love to do a range of role plays from Slice of Life, to mysteries, westerns, or fantasy Fandoms (star wars, just about any anime, Harry Potter, etc.) with any OC or characters from the books or movies or shows. I love to add a ton of drama and twists to them. If you want to roleplay message me! I am free most of the time and look forward to creating something wonderful! Can\u2019t wait to meet you! I have a couple ideas in mind they\u2019re mostly slice of life\u2019s but I\u2019m open to anything. These aren\u2019t set in stone they are open for change. And if you have any idea you want to try please let me know!!\n\nSports Star x wife/girlfriend \n\nMarvel/DC crossover- this is a weird random idea I\u2019ve been wanting to do for a while. \n\nSpace Adventure/odyssey- something to do. With long travels a whole universe we can create together. \n\nVampire x human- kinda cliche and overdone but I kinda want to play the human since I\u2019m always the vampire lol\n\nSuperhero X Ordinary human- a random idea I\u2019ve had for about a literal minute lol. It\u2019s a romance showing the struggles of dating a hero when you\u2019re a regular human. I\u2019d be okay with playing either role. Kinda interested in being the human but hero is fine too. From marvel or DC or any universe is fine even OCs if you have em!\n\nThese are just suggestions if you like one I don\u2019t mind doing one of your ideas! \nI look forward to hearing from you!",

            "selftext": "I am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+\n\nYou were an eighteen year old college student when your life changed forever. \n\nA goddess of complete beauty, the fantasy of any young mortal, a power and progenitor of nature itself, calls upon you from her ethereal plane. She is vivacious- a bombshell, a face you may have dreamed of- and she has summoned you to be her mate, consort, even.\n\nThis will be something short-term. \n\n[reference](http://imgur.com/a/EREsN2f)\n\n*Here's my opening for the RP-*\n\n\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\n\n\"And he scores!\" The announcer yells, celebrating your victory. The campus crowd cheers. The Yale team is clearly at a loss as you power through their team, kicking the ball into the net. \n\nYou smile, knowing you'd won. Your teammates clasp you on the back congratulating you. The Harvard cheer team goes into their moves and cheer chants. This was the fifth game this season one by your hand. You'd cleared through the Ivy League soccer league, and for the first time in fifty years it looked like the team could win through all of D1 sports. You were making headlines. You were becoming something of a college celebrity. \n\nYou headed to the showers. You let the cool water run across your slim, athletic body. Your phone buzzed. It was Rachel, the cheer team captain. It looked like she wanted to slam again tonight. You hoped she wouldn't want to date. You had options, and you weren't going to stay with anyone, even if she was a 10. \n\nYou cleaned off- fresh and renewed. You walked through campus, congratulations and winks all along the way from the campus crowd. \n\nYou went to your dorm, and started to practice your guitar. You had a test tomorrow, but it wasn't like you needed to study. You simply strummed along, taking a chance to be alone. \n\nTime passed, and you had the distinct feeling of warmth in your chest. It was like there was some kind of... presence. You looked up, and saw that, to your dismay, the fabric of reality distorted before you, shimmering and waving, before eventually ripping open leaving a glimmering wave of light. It was beautiful, otherworldly, and somehow real. You felt drawn to it- somehow sensing by your own nature that it was a door to another world.\n\n\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\n\nAs you can tell I'm a very detailed writer. I'm not out here to ghost anybody, and I'm looking to write a detailed rp here. \n\nThe dynamic I'm going for here is between an ancient goddess, one who mortal women are but a poor reflection of- she is at the pinnacle of power and beauty. And a young mortal has caught her eye- a youth of eighteen who is supremely fair, and victorious in all that he does. Though he is mortal, he has met the goddesses standards, and so is beckoned to Olympus because she adores and wants him so.\n\nThanks!",

I've done a number of scenes on omegle that actually ended up turning out to be extremely fun, but they've all died out. So I'm here looking for a long term partner who's looking for a fun story to create together. Like I said, I've done a few but I definitely wouldn't consider myself a vet or extremely experienced, so please don't expect an award winning writer. But I do like to consider myself decent enough to hold my own and able to make something fun. I definitely prefer to write in first person and I'd like to either stay on reddit PM's or Discord, those two are just easier for me. For anything else you can look at my profile to see if we're a good match\n\n[profile](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoleplayGateway/comments/41qf5a/profile_aaronthrowaway34/)\n \n\nIf you like what you see and think we can come up with something fun, or if you have any suggestions for me, let me know, thanks",

            "selftext": "Hi everyone, I am an European guy who\u2019s looking for a long term role play partner that won\u2019t ghost me and that is willing to develop a story with me. Lately I have been looking for a slice of life or a historical role play to do on Discord. The story will include elements such as : romance, adventure, drama... but we can add many other elements as well. I do already have a couple of ideas in mind but we can adjust them or figure out something new together according to our mutual interests. I also like to include some secondary characters although the story will focus mostly on our own ones. Here\u2019s a little bit more about me : I\u2019m 19, I\u2019ve been role playing since several years and I write in descriptive and detailed paragraphs. In order to role play I use only third person and I write in past tense. Everyone is welcome to text me if interested but if you are European it\u2019d be a huge plus due to the possible time difference. I will try to be as active as possible but, due to working, there\u2019ll be times where I\u2019ll be busy. In case there will be a big time difference between our countries we can figure out a solution together and find a way to organise everything. Don\u2019t hesitate to contact me if you think we could be role play partners. Have a wonderful day ladies ! :)",

            "selftext": "Looking for fellow canon x canon shippers for the following fandoms, cravings in bold: Hunger Games, **Queen's Gambit**, The Maze Runner, **Naruto**, MHA, **Godless**, **Death Note**, **ATLA**, LOK, GoT, FE3H, Harry Potter, **dot hack**, Fruits Basket, Doctor Who, Star Trek, **Yu Yu Hakusho**, Law and Order SVU, **Phineas and Ferb**, Star vs The Forces of Evil, Community, Rick and Morty, Harry Potter, and Yokai Watch.\n\nAll canons and lore will be adjusted to ensure our characters are 18 years or older. For instance, in MHA UA will be changed to a university and for Naruto, the Academy goes from 12-18 so all graduates put into teams will be 18. And in Star vs The Forces of Evil, our RP won't begin until Star and Marco are adults, entering community college. Or that the school Star visited in the first season, was already community college. Or for Yu Yu Hakusho, Yusuke would be a college student, as opposed to middle school. Those are just some examples but the rest of the fandoms will be adjusted similarly.\n\nI can play either gender but prefer writing against male writers. I am in my early 30s and want someone is also at least in their mid-20s for the sake of us having similar outside expectations and obligationsl. I post when I can and don't hassle folks to reply unless it's been over a week. Heck, if you need to take a few weeks off from posting, that's fine if you communicate that. I'm pretty lax and understanding. We all have lives outside of this hobby. I am currently going back to school so my time varies. That said, I am active in OOC if you are. If you wanna talk about your day and need to vent, that's awesome. I enjoy a good back and forth with my partners, if you're on the quiet side, that's okay but I still expect us to plot about our story at least.\n\nGenerally I prefer to write via discord and give about 1-2 posts (per its character limit), depending on the scene (aka about 4-6 paragraphs total). I love slice of life and romance, action is not my strong suit but I am eager to improve in that area as we go. Something slow burn is ideal regarding romance. I'm not looking to inject too much drama into my stories however, because life is stressful enough. Things like love triangles don't interest me in the slightest. I enjoy challenges when characters can come out of the other side for the better. I do not enjoy mentally torturing characters for the sake of drama.\n\nAnything else, we can figure out via PM. If you're curious about something not listed or something celeb based, still reach out. Also crossovers can be super fun too. I'm pretty open-minded! I am ghost friendly if that matters. Ideally we'd talk things out but if life gets too zany and you go silent for a few weeks, I get it. Just hit me back and we can pick up where we left off. \n\nI don't want to move to discord until we've talked a little bit and get a feel for one another and that we're on the same page regarding a jumping off point and our agreed upon pairing.",

            "selftext": "Hi there! 21 year old male looking to indulge in a roleplay set within the Dark Souls universe.  This will be an MxF roleplay, with myself playing the male.\n\nSpecifically, I'm looking for a female roleplayer over the age of 18 with at least basic knowledge of the games. Especially Dark Souls 3, as that is the time I'd like to set this in.\n\nWhile RPs with canon characters isn't normally something I do, I have a sudden urge to do a roleplay with the Dark Souls 3 Firekeeper and the Ashen One. I see this as a pairing with the potential for some sweet romance and steamy interactions. This would mainly revolve around the Firekeeper's position as a guide and shoulder to lean on for the Ashen One. Someone who can try to take away the pain from their usual toil and help them recuperate after battle. As they are the only thing that the Ashen One is able to find solace in along their journey, it makes sense that a close relationship between the two is forged. While at first this might just come from their reliance on each other, I can see it blossoming into a very deep and intimate pairing.\n\nIt's no surprise that I intend for NSFW content to take place, but not without substance. My hope is for this to be a character driven narrative, with a lot of development on both sides with a hint of adventure thrown into the mix.\n\nPlease come to me showing some enthusiasm, and be willing to work with me on the setting. I love a partner that wants to be involved in the creative process rather than just being a passenger. Along with that, expect a large degree of OOC chatter. I like making friends through roleplay, as I think it's a great social experience. I also just love discussing the roleplay, the setting and pretty much anything in between.\n\nIf you read through that and are still interested, shoot me a DM and we can chat further!\n\n\nMy preferred platform is Discord.",

You walked through campus, congratulations and winks all along the way from the campus crowd. \n\nYou went to your dorm, and started to practice your guitar. You had a test tomorrow, but it wasn't like you needed to study. You simply strummed along, taking a chance to be alone. \n\nTime passed, and you had the distinct feeling of warmth in your chest. It was like there was some kind of... presence. You looked up, and saw that, to your dismay, the fabric of reality distorted before you, shimmering and waving, before eventually ripping open leaving a glimmering wave of light. It was beautiful, otherworldly, and somehow real. You felt drawn to it- somehow sensing by your own nature that it was a door to another world.\n\n\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\n\nAs you can tell I'm a very detailed writer. I'm not out here to ghost anybody, and I'm looking to write a detailed rp here. Thanks!",

I'm a culinary student, I like to show off and talk about food!\n\nI am very much interested in Warhammer Fantasy/40k, World of Warcraft, Berzerk, and various other fantasy/sci-fi fandoms. Grimdark is my overall preferred theme for fiction and writing. Fantasy close second. Cyberpunk has it's own special place in my heart. I love Shadowrun and Cyberpunk 2020/2077 settings.\n\nI prefer to speak over Discord, so hopefully if you have interest in a long term RP partnership, PM me and we can work something out. :)",

            "selftext": "Hi hi!  \n\n\nSo, the premise for this is still being worked on in detail but I do have a rough idea of a concept regardless.  \n\n\nI would be looking for someone capable of playing a young woman of around 18-25 years of age. Her and her family have recently moved to a small town in the southern states of America. Unfortunately, since moving there they have faced a lot of issues and trouble regarding one aspect of the family.  \n\n\nThey are Muslim. Though they do not push their religion into the faces of others and just want a quiet life, they are sadly often targeted by those whom want them gone from the town and soon. They won't stop at anything to force the family out, which results in a rather nasty assault attempted upon the youngest daughter.  \n\n\nThis is witnessed by my character William, who steps in to protect her and is also beaten up. He manages to protect the daughter, though ending up with him having broken ribs, a fractured right arm and rather nasty cuts and bruises. Whilst in hospital, he meets the family including Y/C. She is the second youngest daughter, and comes to see Will each and every day even after her sister is discharged.  \n\n\nAnd that is all I have, thus far. I know it's rather rough, but I kinda wanted to put the basic backstory in place before exploring more possible routes this story could go. I would LOVE a romance between Will and Y/C of course, perhaps eventually resulting in a marriage.",
