I want some who will be active. I'm not saying reply several times daily, but a least every couple of days.\n\nI want to do a pre-established world roleplay. For example: skyrim, fallout, dragon age or mass effect. We can discuss which of these or any other ones you might want to possibly do. I'm not looking to roleplay any game characters. It'll be our orginal characters in a pre-established world. \n\nI downloaded discord to possibly use to roleplay, but I've never used it and am not sure how. Willing to learn though. I'm not sure if roleplaying on here is an option, never tried on here. I normally roleplay via email. But I'm flexible when it comes to it.",

            "selftext": " Quick disclaimer: I am happy to write with men, but I do not write romance with them.\n\nHello! Thank you for taking the time to read over this post. First and foremost, what the heck does that title mean? In short, I don't want to write a realistic, modern, slice-of-life story. I am happy to write something modern (although I am picky about that setting), and I am happy to write something slice-of-life, it simply cannot be something I could live myself. I am coming to write because I like being creative and escaping my world for a few moments. My reality is a 9-5 job, so I don't have much interest in writing that.\n\nIf you're interested in writing with me, I ask that you:\n\n1. Care about your writing. There are plenty of excuses to take a day off or have mistakes, but consistent issues communicates that you don't care. I don't want to write with someone who doesn't care.\n2. Be able to communicate. I'm friendly and chatty, so if you don't want to be please just let me know. If you need to take a week off, let me know.\n3. Be kind. I will probably make mistakes. I try really hard to remember I'm not talking to a screen, but a person. Please do the same.\n4. Are passionate about your writing. I love creating worlds and people, and I want to do that with someone else who loves it like I do.\n\nWhat am I interested in writing? Good question! I like fantasy, science fiction, exploration, adventure, romance, drama, and I love happy endings. If we throw any of those in a blender, I will more than likely be a happy man. Here's a quick list of prompts:\n\n1. Transitioning to from surviving to \"thriving\" in a post-post nuclear apocalypse setting (Fallout?)\n2. Delving into both caves and political drama in a fantasy setting\n3. An arranged marriage, one in which the tables were turned and the man is handed to the woman\n4. Avatar the Last Airbender (anything, really. I can do an original universe with the same magic system or explore beside main characters. I just ask you and I both write OC's)\n5. Living in a world going through the industrial revolution with one big stain: magic exists and utterly tears up machines\n6. Anything you can think of that is unusual\n\nNow, let's get into *how* I write. Third person, past tense, all in Discord. I've found that it serves as the best way to organize information. I tend to match my partner's length with varying levels of depth. I would say that, generally, I write what I feel is necessary. I've given three lines because a scene was all dialogue, and I've tried to describe three character's thoughts in one post, leading to 8,000 + characters. I tend to focus on one or two special characters who I consider \"main\", and let the rest develop or leave naturally with my partner.\n\nThank you so much for taking the time to read this!",

            "selftext": "Hello! My name is Leiloni, or just Loni, and I am looking for a longterm roleplay partner. I'm looking for mainly romance, SoL, action type stuff. I do love romance but I don't want like, it all to be solely focused on that. I like drama, adding in little events that can change how things go, not everything is going to be perfect. I want our characters to not only build a friendship/relationship, but also learn and grow as people. \n\nI have some ideas for some dynamics or pairings, but I'm open to other stuff too! I also have ideas for different settings. \n\nSettings: Fantasy. Something maybe like, a princess and a guard falling in love? That could of course cause many issues and conflicts. Or, could go a more easy route, like two people from different races meet somehow? I'm open to things like vampires, fairies, ect. I don't like roleplaying with or as like, animals and such, so that's off the table for me. \n\n-College. Could be something as simple as two people meet somehow, maybe at a party, a sporting event, something and they start to hit it off. I find this to be kinda easy, you can do a bit more realistic stuff here and it's fun regardless. \n\n-Genshin roleplay! My partner dropped me recently and it bummed me out, it was one of my favorites. I had an OC made, and she played out and DM'd Canon characters and such. It was a blast! Obviously if you don't wanna play Canon, id love to play an OC with you!\n\nOf course I can always talk more about pairings, like bad boy/shy girl, sporty girl/nerdy guy, and much more. Roles of course can always be reversed. \n\nSome stuff about me, I'm 22, I'm in EST and I play games a lot! I love talking to my RP partner outside of roleplays and building a friendship there, and if we ever get bored of a roleplay I'm down to have multiple going! I hope I caught your attention and we can work on something together \u263a",

I'm Commander Shepard and this is my favorite subreddit on the Citadel.\n\nOkay, bad reference out of the way now, I played the Legendary Edition (and thus the trilogy, again, for the 3,000th time) and I'm on a Mass Effect itch! Canon or OC characters would be cool, I don't mind either way - I know a lot about the lore so I could help you with the details of an OC. Some possible ideas (and feel free to add yours). Mass Effect is actually how I first got into roleplaying, so it's kinda neat to want to get back into it!\n\n-We could be Shepard and crew, of course. I'm open to OCs being part of Shepard's crew just as long as they... fit in? My main OC used to be in a relationship with a Shepard!\n\n-Could be a pair (or group) of aliens working together during the Reaper War, learning to put differences aside, get along, etc etc. I think it'd be super fun to play as a Quarian, but I've also got an already developed Asari character I've been playing since I was literally like... 13\n\n-Humans during the First Contact War - maybe a human and turian who become friends against all odds? perhaps they're both stranded and need to survive?\n\n-Could be set during the Rachni War, that's an unexplored period of time so it'd be fun to explore and make up our own lore!\n\n-Like I said I'm open to any ideas so please if you have any more let me know! \n\n-I'm open to romance but that's not the main thing I'm looking for. I'd want that to develop naturally, if it felt forced or if you tried to make a character specifically for romance I'd feel pretty uncomfy.\n\n-That's it I think! Thanks for reading! There is a Mass Effect 5e Conversion, so if you're familiar with D&amp;D 5th Edition, maybe I could run a solo campaign for you? Just an idea!",

            "selftext": "Characters are +18 please read whole post! \n\nHey everyone! So I wanted to give ya'll a rundown of what Im looking for in particular. I am a big My Hero Academia fan (watch the anime and I read the manga, spin off series too), I find the world of it to be fascinating. From the more commercial aspects of being a pro hero, to being a hopeful student at UA, to the amazing and even outlandish quirks one could have! (or not). So it should be obvious that I would love to set an original story/rp within the universe of MHA full of original characters and situations. I want it to almost feel like one long series (thats why I would like this to be longterm), to explore our characters and who they are. A rp filled with humor, serious moments, angst, romance, drama, action, and nsfw elements (for further inquiriesjust ask). At the moment the basic idea of what I am looking for plot wise is just for us to play UA students and go from there! While I do want nsfw elements in this, I do want a partner who is genuinely into developing our characters, telling stories with them, and creating something truly awesome. This will not be and I do not want it to be, a one sided effort, I want a partner who will speak their mind and bring ideas to the table and work with me to make all this possible!\n\nTo go a bit more into detail about what I want in a partner (besides what I just stated above ^), I would like a partner with experience role playing and who is familiar with the source material! I would appreciate a partner who communicates and does not ghost, who does not just nod a long to what I am saying and instead contributes and helps worldbuild! My writing style is basically: Whatever feels natural and in the moment. I will be writing perhaps about a paragraph or so in responses. But during intimate moments My responses might be a bit shorter. If you have questions about this please ask. I am not asking you to be a super punctual or incredibly literate, but I would like there to be effort and description in your writing.\n\nSome role play preferences of mine: I am in the US PST time zone and would like a partner either the same time zone or one that is not super far off from me. EST id perfectly acceptable and CST in some instances. Just ask. I also prefer to role play on discord so make sure you have an account!",

            "selftext": "The superhero genre has been done to death. Spandex, masks over their eyes, impractical amounts of collateral damage in the streets as they duke it out with cheesy villains\u2026 yeah, we\u2019ve all seen it before. \n\nIf you think the same as I do, you\u2019ll be glad to hear that there\u2019s no spandex outfits here, just kevlar coats and grappling hooks. No superpowered duels, but plenty of gunfights and skulking around in the night.\n\nWhat I\u2019m about to propose is a world that subverts the whole schtick with capes and supersuits, and makes a gritty thriller of a setting with it that is if not realistic, at least believable. If you\u2019re fond of superpowers, but are sick of the genre, this might just be the thing for you.\n\n----\n\n*The shining megacity of Amacine proper is one of only four capital cities in the world, and Amacine itself one of only four kingdoms. Centuries ago, it was only one of the dozens that populated the world.*\n\n*When the Privileged\u2014wielders of incredible powers hitherto unknown\u2014 first appeared, they sparked a worldwide conflict that raged on for decades. The kingdoms that stand today rose to power during the war. Although the Privileged were celebrated as exemplars of human strength, the world accepted them bitterly, for their kind had caused the war. They were a reminder of everything that had been lost: entire nations with rich cultures and histories, all swept away in little more than a generation.*\n\n*Years of the Privileged abusing their powers stoked the underlying resentment for them, and over the generations, they went from revered to despised, and from despised to tolerated\u2026 just barely, anyway.* \n\n*Today, it is common practice for them to hide their abilities, though it isn\u2019t rare to see some Privileged employed specifically for their abilities in branches of the government, military, or assorted corporations. Then, there are those who flaunt their power, who use them to take what they want, wreak havoc, or send a message.* \n\n*When the worst of Privileged can wipe out entire teams sent after them with only the slightest warning, or escape captivity long before a verdict can be given, dealing with them is no easy task. For better or worse, each kingdom has found their own way to handle the issue, and Amacine is no exception.*\n\n*If you know where to look, you might just be able to spot their solution. Men and women\u2014 Privileged, wearing featureless black masks and grey coats. They appear for a single, often violent night. When morning comes, they\u2019ve disappeared along with the bodies.*\n\n*Officially, they don\u2019t exist. Unofficially, they\u2019re Amacine\u2019s judge, jury, and executioner for Privileged that can\u2019t or won\u2019t be handled through conventional means. They simply call themselves the Initiative, and their operatives are used for everything from undercover work, to reconnaissance, forensic investigation, and of course, direct confrontation.* \n\n*They may be funded with royal approval, but they operate outside of the law and in near total secrecy. Few people aside from select members of relevant intelligence agencies even know of their existence, and those that do are involved in keeping their tracks wiped. The command structure of the Initiative is opaque even to insiders, and agents are expected to keep their identities secret from even their own colleagues. Most field agents have never even seen their colleagues without their masks on, and their \u2018real lives\u2019 are supposed to be little more than covers. Partners could bump into each other in a cafe and never even know who they\u2019d just encountered.*\n\n\n*Still, they protect Amacine\u2019s innocents by getting their hands dirty. That\u2019s what they say, at least. But they can be trusted, right?*\n\n----\n\nHello there! I\u2019m Mint. I live in EST, and I\u2019m a fairly active, detailed writer looking for a literate writer to not just write an RP with, but also to help me build the world and premise. \n\nKeeping this in mind, everything you\u2019ve read is just a sneak peek into the current iteration for my idea, but I\u2019m more than happy for us to edit and fill in the gaps if you\u2019d like to write together. A lot of it\u2019s a work in progress, after all.\n\nAs for the premise? Well, it\u2019s totally up for change, but it goes as follows: Two field agents working separate cases spot each other while tailing their targets. After a misunderstanding, the two get into a fight and almost expose themselves- and by extension, the Initiative. \n\nJust when things couldn\u2019t get more inconvenient, when the two are next called in by their superior, they\u2019re informed that their targets have begun cooperating. To pool their respective experience and intelligence on each one, they\u2019ve been assigned to each other. Tensions might still be high between the pair, but they\u2019re professional enough to get over it\u2026 probably.\n\nThere\u2019s really nothing quite like a contentious rivalry to kick off a friendship. \n\n\nAnyways, if you\u2019re still interested in writing with me, feel free to send a message my way!",

I'm looking for 18+ writing partner(s), to write on Discord with. I am 18+, meaning I will not write with you if you're a minor. Also, all the characters have to be 18+. I write in 3rd person and I will adjust myself to the length of your replies ~~even though I'm more interested in longer and more detailed writing~~.. I will write the starter for you since I'm the one seeking partners. I don't care how often you reply nor will I ever push you for replies, we're both meant to enjoy the experience of writing! I'm interested in writing romantic plotlines and romance in general, so if that's not your thing maybe I'm not the partner for you! I'm always open to write more than just one pairing, plotline. I do know my Star Wars lore, canon more than legends, but please forgive me if I mess something up. I usually write ***female*** characters.\n\n&gt;I would like to explore relationships between *canon characters* or *canon characters and my OC;* so if you are not interested in playing a Canon character, please don't interact. I have a few ideas for the plots including my OCs so if you're interested in them let me know. I'm more into Prequels, The Clone Wars and OT, than Sequels. Even though my current hyperfixation is on The Mandalorian and the upcoming Kenobi show. Here are some ships/stories I'd be interested in, the first character would be the one I'd be willing to play, if you have any other plot suggestions regarding these pairings please let me know :\n\n* ***Padm\u00e9 x Obi-Wan*** = **1.** *Alternative timeline* \u2014 Instead of Anakin, Obi-Wan is the one sent to the Naboo to protect the senator of Naboo. What he doesn't know is that Padm\u00e9 had feelings for the young Jedi Padawan all those years ago when he &amp; his master Qui-Gon Jinn helped free the planet of Naboo from the Separatists' seige.**2.** *Padm\u00e9 lives* \u2014 Even though everyone believes senator Amidala died during the Jedi Purge, she survived &amp; erased every track of her existence. The twins remained with her, &amp; by the order of the Great Jedi Master Yoda, she was sent into hiding on the planet of Tatooine. With Obi-Wan as her guardian.**3**. *Jedi friend* \u2014 Even though a few years older than her, Obi-Wan was always close to a fellow Jedi Knight, Padm\u00e9 Naberrie. Now, he's a Jedi Master while she's still a Jedi Knight, and he's taken Anakin Skywalker to be his padawan.**4.** *Cheating* \u2014 Too late did she realize that she picked the wrong Jedi. / This is before she's actually pregnant with Anakin.\n* ***Ahsoka x Obi-Wan*** = **1.** *Together again* \u2014 Ahsoka never left the Jedi Order. Instead, she was put under Mace Windu's supervision. She was separated from Anakin's teachings but as well from her other Master, Obi-Wan Kenobi. A Master she secretly had a crush on. Unaware of the feelings she developed, years later she's sent to a mission on Cato Neimodia. With Obi-Wan Kenobi.**2.** *In search for an ally* \u2014 After the Jedi Purge, Ahsoka is left alone wandering the planets of the Galaxy. Until she finds her way to Tatooine, where she's informed that an odd man by the name Ben lives in the sand canyon.\n* ***Omera x Din Djarin*** = **1.** *Stay* \u2014 Scenario in which Din doesn't leave Omera's village &amp; instead finds a peaceful life with the Child/Grogu there.**2.** *All alone* \u2014 After Grogu was taken to his Jedi training with the Jedi Luke Skywalker, Din is left alone &amp; decides he wants to visit the small village that offered him help a year ago. Also, to check on the humble widow that lived there. / We can also say Grogu stayed with Din &amp; they're both going back to Omera.\n* ***Ahsoka x Din Djarin*** = **1.** *I can train him* \u2014 Ahsoka agrees to train Grogu and accompany the clan of two on their way across the Galaxy.**2.** *A Jedi and a Mandalorian* \u2014 After letting Grogu with Luke Skywalker, Din searches for Ahsoka so the two of them would clear the galaxy of any Empire inheritance, and help free the planets under Empire's oppression.\n* ***Luminara Unduli x Obi-Wan*** = **1.** *Closest to a friend* \u2014 Growing up together in a Jedi Temple came with many obstacles, but one thing was for sure; they would all make friends they would hold close to heart. It wasn't any different for Luminara and Obi-Wan, who instead managed to attract feelings they didn't intend to attract in the first place. / This can be in any period of their life, we can write them as Padawans or Jedi Knights or experienced Jedi Masters.\n* ***Luminara Unduli x Bail Organa*** = **1.** *A Jedi and a Senator* \u2014 Love if forbidden for a Jedi. Until she falls in love, that is. Even more, for a Senator who's already promised to another.\n* ***Padm\u00e9 x Captain Rex*** = **1.** *Behind his back* \u2014 Even though she's secretly promised to another, Padm\u00e9 couldn't help the obvious attraction between her and the Captain of the 501st Legion.\n* ***Padm\u00e9 x Din Djarin*** = **1.** *Protect her* \u2014 Bounty hunter is hired to protect the Senator of the New Republic after an attempted assassination on her life by the former Empire supporters.**2.** *Daycare* \u2014 A handmaiden from Naboo, Padm\u00e9 Naberrie, agrees to accompany a Mandalorian bounty hunter and his foundling, Grogu. Her primary purpose is to take care of the Child while helping Mando with his quarries.",

I write a few long paragraphs  per post and would like a partner who is also literate that I can be friends with outside the roleplay. \n\nNow for the plot: \nOur characters are trapped in purgatory. Maybe purgatory is a form of jail, maybe they died and are getting a second chance, we can work that part out together. Purgatory is like a mirrored version of the real word, except there is never any sun and it is inhabited by mutant creatures designed to kill the humans trying to escape. There are vampires, witches, and other humans who have been there long enough to lose their humanity. Our two characters meet and decide to help each other journey through this eerie world to get out. \n\nI prefer to play female, though for the right partner I could be convinced to play male. I also prefer to play female opposite of a male character, but your real gender doesn\u2019t matter and again this is not set in stone. \n\nI usually use discord.

Bad boy and good girl roles are my current cup of tea so I'm looking for your plots that involve these personalities. I have some short prompts that we can add to your plot as well to make it enjoyable for the both of us.\n\nI love clich\u00e9 but right now I'm looking for unique twists in these clich\u00e9s. Enemies to lovers are my go to as well as slice of life and romance. If you have roles please message me them and don't just say hi! Introduce yourself because first impression matters!\n\nI write about 3-4 paragraphs and would like someone to write as much with great detail. It just makes it more enticing and I more interested with the role play.\n\nI'll get right back to you as soon as I can. Hope to role play with you!",

He robs stores, trashes vending machines, rifles through cafeterias and empties out kitchens to survive.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s something deeper going on. This monster is intelligent. He speaks perfectly. The recent stories running abound of violence, death and horrific sightings are unsubstantiated or confused. \n\nThis is where your character comes in.

I love doing it but lately it\u2019s been hurting me a lot. I\u2019m on the GMT time zone and I do work, I can get busy please don\u2019t spam me with hey? Or hey. If I don\u2019t reply fast enough, I do work and I\u2019m doing a lot of hours this week. \n\nI do have some things I like to look for in partners first of all; third person, past tense, lots of detail and you must be able to play canon males for oc x canon pairings. I\u2019d be the oc and you the canon. I do also enjoy love triangles where they are possible. I can double but honestly I\u2019ve had so many bad experiences I\u2019m trying not to double up anymore. It just never ends up working out for me. Also please make sure you enjoy plotting! \n\nSo I am looking for fandoms I do only do fandoms and I do try to exclusively roleplay on discord using reddit and tumblr as platforms to find the roleplay :). Anyway... my fandoms are as follows: Harry Potter, Merlin, Reign, Outlander, Divergent, Maze Runner, Percy Jackson, Teen Wolf or The Originals.\n\nThe originals is my all time favourite show at the moment. I\u2019m currently simping over the Mikaelson men because oh my goodness! Dylan O\u2019Brien and the Mikaelson men are just \ud83d\ude0d. Anything with Dylan O\u2019Brien or the Mikaelson\u2019s would be amazing! \n\nPlease also note I don\u2019t enjoy partners who use slang or text talk in ooc or who pressure me for NSFW. I don\u2019t write it. I\u2019m really looking forward to getting started in to some epic plotting- I love to plot so please make sure you do!",

            "selftext": "**[Fandoms and original settings I'm most interested in are towards the bottom. Please consider reading my full post if you anticipate messaging me!]**\n\nHi, all. I haven't actually posted a roleplay ad in quite a while. Life has consumed me for the past couple of years but I dearly miss writing a little bit each day. I used to be able to spit out entire novels without effort but now I'm content with just 1,000 words a day. Still, writing so little on my own leaves me feeling fairly unfulfilled. I've actually turned to writing quite a bit on fitness subreddits just to fulfill my urge to write! But alas, storytelling and drama is what I seek more than anything else.\n\nA bit about me: I'm a mid-twenties husband &amp; father a couple of years away from obtaining my life goal of becoming a Doctor. I had always wanted to build a career in writing but I decided to take a more clinical route and couldn't be happier, but I still want to tell stories! I typically have roleplayed as DM, either in a one-on-one partnership or in tabletop groups, but I'm obviously seeking the former today. I don't have as much time to write as I'd like but I promise I can get out at least one or two posts every weekday. I may occasionally get out a response on weekends but my family time is pretty valuable to me, so I won't be entirely consistent Saturday &amp; Sunday. I also tend to write anywhere between three and eight paragraphs per post -- But I'm not necessarily opposed to some rapid-fire dialogue now and then, provided it's at least a complex discussion between the characters! Additionally, I'm looking for other a standard one-on-one story, or a story where I DM for you and I. I'm indecisive on which I'd like more, so you're welcome to choose!\n\nAs for you, I'd prefer you to be a female (you can write as whichever gender you prefer, but I prefer to write with female partners). I would hope for at least a post or two a day as well as some OOC discussion too, as I really value friendships with my partners! Similarly, someone who has been writing for some time and can write at an advanced level would be fantastic! However, I'm also more than happy to foster someone newer provided you're passionate about writing and put in the effort.\n\nAs for settings: I have a love for both fandom and original settings. I love history, particularly European Medieval periods. I also love the romanticized versions of Feudal Japan but I'm sad to say that my realm of knowledge doesn't include a more realistic interpretation of the Samurai cultures. \n\nAs far as fandoms go, OC's are required. I'll just list what universes interest me the most:\n\n* Cyberpunk 2077: This is my most preferred fandom.\n* Sci-Fi: Mass Effect, Star Wars.\n* Fantasy: Warcraft, Avatar, Elder Scrolls.\n\nAnd some ideas for original settings:\n\n* A Modern-Day Noir Setting (Emphasis on Criminal Investigation)\n* Medieval Setting (Norse, Anglo-Saxon settings) (Semi-realistic)\n* Early 20th Century Gang Setting (Post WWI Gangs, or Prohibition Era Gangs)\n* Anything in 1980's Miami or Los Angeles. I really enjoy Retrowave/Synthwave influences.\n\nObviously, these fandoms and settings are just some of what I enjoy but I'm extremely flexible. I will absolutely write in **any setting**, because I'm more interested in finding a fantastic partner rather than trying to fulfill a specific itch. Above all else, I value literary expertise. I'm not saying you have to be a master writer but I'd hope you have an understanding of the language to the point to where writing is an art as much as a hobby. \n\nNo writing samples are necessary. Face claims are acceptable, but I'm indifferent to them. I unfortunately don't have any specific writing samples saved but you're more than welcome to view my post history as I often post on fitness and health subreddits and give in-depth explanations of scientific studies, and even then I would argue that those pale in comparison to my actual writing skills. \n\nIf you're at all interested, please send me a message! Thanks!",

            "selftext": "Hello, thanks for checking out my thread! I have just started playing Mass Effect for the first time with the legendary edition, and am looking for a partner to RP with in that universe. I am a 26 year old  man in the EST timezone, who works Sunday-Thursday. I am available most days and will post at least once per day, usually more. I am looking for a  partner who I can get along with OOC, and who shares a love for fawning  over a roleplay like I do!\n\nI'm looking for somebody to play a female character, and I will play male or female based on your preference. I find quarian partners most interesting, but asari are fine as well. I want romance in all of my  roleplays, so be okay with that. With that being said, forced romance is no good. Love at first sight stuff can be fun if done right, but I'm not looking for something overly cheesy.\n\nI am happy to do a standard Mass Effect roleplay, but am also happy to do a crossover. One idea I had was a wizard of some sort, such as from Dungeons and Dragons, accidentally magicking their way into the ME universe. We could explore how tech, biotics and true magic intermingle and of course the shocks both parties would go through seeing such highly advanced technology and real magic for the first time.\n\nI'm also very happy to play canon characters or OCs in the baseline Mass  Effect universe. I'd love to do a Shepard x Tali rp. Please note that I won't play *all* canon characters, as some simply don't interest me to play.\n\nPM me if you're interested and I'll share my Discord.",

I have many years of experience in the world of roleplay and I'm currently looking for a roleplay partner that equally shares a passion in creating new worlds and brainstorming ideas as I do. I would love to have a partner that is dedicated to roleplaying and understanding if I may get busy, I'm not one for ghosting and I'm happy to go over things if the roleplay isn't working out or changes need to be made.\n\nI work during the week, but from home during the pandemic so I can spare more time to reply and come up with ideas. Currently my favourite settings are Fantasy, Western, Apocalyptic, Slice Of Life and Mafia. I have a few ideas in mind for each but I usually like to combine and share interests/ideas to make the plot best suited to our likings as possible. I typically like to write at least a paragraph or more for a reply and expect something similar from my roleplay partner. I usually look for a long-term story that can fit in plenty of action, adventure, drama, romance and so much more. There is no judge on character builds and ideas, so go wild!\n\nIf this takes your interest and want to make a new world with me, please feel free to send over a message and we can discuss further ideas and hopefully make a great plot together. I mostly roleplay on Discord due to having better notifications, so if you having that is a bonus! (I am a 18+ Male writer from the UK (GMT))\n\nThank you for reading and hopefully I'll talk to you soon!",

With you two gunning after the cult of the yellow king.\n\nI have a personal favorite character named Dr.Hollow. He looks like the modern depiction of a skinwalker or a wendigo (since pop culture has really blended the two together) he was heavily inspired by Wilbur Wheatley from the dunwhich horror, the game bloodborne/ the show supernatural, with Elias from Ancient Magus bride sprinkled in there. (I\u2019ve got pictures and references!)\n\nBasically, he\u2019s an eccentric, 9ft tall, warlock detective, who hunts monsters.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nStory\n\nSo you can come in, in many different ways! Maybe you\u2019re a new employee at his Monster Hunting Firm.\nMaybe you\u2019re a mysterious guest at a ball! Maybe you just met at a bar! \nGenuinely you can come in anyway we see the fit. I can really role with what over. \nYou can be anything from a human to a monster. But admittedly it\u2019s extra points for a human or any kind of gentle spirit. (Angel, Dryad, Oracle, what ever!) \nI\u2019d prefer you\u2019re atleast 18, I\u2019d prefer to rp with people in my age bracket.\n\nNow the world is used to more mundane creatures like elves and dwarfs, more....unique monsters are still very mistrusted. There will be a lot of possibilities for civil issues in the rp!\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nA little bit about me, I\u2019m troop! I\u2019ve been rping for almost 6 years now. I love all things lovecraft! I\u2019m a huge sucker for Horror and Folk Punk music! Now I do come with a warning label, while I\u2019m genuinely working on it, I don\u2019t have long form rp down to a science yet, and I have the tendency to get too excited when I reply and make some grammatical errors. \n\nBut hey if you\u2019re still reading, don\u2019t be afraid to shoot me a message! :)",

            "selftext": "Well hey there! Welcome to my roleplay post! Make yourself at home, yeah?\n\nNow that school has finally released its grasp on me, I have decided to focus more on roleplay! I've been brimming with muse, and I wish to form some stories with people who are just as passionate about these ideas I have. If you're interested in some fandoms, feel free to keep reading!\n\nNow what exactly am I looking for? Well I'm glad you asked. I like taking pre-established worlds and explore and flesh them out some more. I'm sure we've all read a story where we thought that a story would be rather cool if they just added a detail or two. Well I'm here to fulfill those dreams with you! I have seen plenty of shows I'd like to make my own world inside of. I have some ideas, and I would love to share them if you think we will good partners.\n\nThere are some things you should note about me:\n\n* I roleplay in a style that can be described as literate to advanced literate. I like to do at least two paragraphs at minimum, but I don't mind writing more if I deem the scene worthy! I would be rather thankful if you could match such a length!\n* I roleplay on Discord! I just find that to be the easiest way to roleplay, such as creating characters and plots.\n* I tend to enjoy stories with rather large casts involving many characters and many different moving parts. I would like a partner who would be willing to do the same with me! After all, what's a roleplay without a number of characters yeah?  \n\n   * To add onto this role, I tend to prefer making OCs as opposed to using canon characters. That's why I like making my own original narratives, just so I can focus on my own characters. I don't mind having canon characters being background characters or making cameos, but I would like to focus on our own originals, yeah?\n* In relation to the bullet point above, I would prefer someone who can roleplay many different types of characters. Whether it be personalities, sexualities, races, or whatever we think we need, a story where everyone is the same is rather boring to me. I would like to avoid that.\n\nNow that we have those rules done, let's get onto the fandoms! The bold ones are the ones I'm more interested in doing, but remember that all of the fandoms I have listed are on the table for roleplays!\n\n* **Naruto**\n   * *(Specifically the Naruto/Naruto: Shippuden Era; I do not know too much about the Boruto world, but I would not be opposed to making our own version of a next generation roleplay!)*\n* **Jujutsu Kaisen**\n   * *(I am caught up to the manga, so if you're not caught up feel free to let me know so I don't accidentally spoil the story! Trust me, you don't want it spoiled.)*\n* **JoJo's Bizarre Adventure**\n   * *(I am not familiar with the content of JoJolion, but I am caught up with all other iterations of the JJBA manga)*\n* Haikyuu!\n   * *(While I am not finished with the anime, and am also unfamiliar with the manga, I was too interested in Haikyuu! to not include it! I mean, a team playing volleyball together? Sounds pretty good to me.)*\n* **Hunter X Hunter**\n   * *(I am only caught up to the anime, and therefore have no knowledge on the manga.)*\n* Demon Slayer\n   * *(I am caught up with the manga, so please let me know if you are familiar with the manga of Demon Slayer so I do not spoil you!)*\n* **RWBY**\n   * *(I know, technically not an anime, but I have caught up to Volume 8. I am not the biggest fan of RWBY I must admit, the writing isn't my cup of tea, but the world and concept is so interesting that I would love to do a sort of revamp to fix some of the details that the writers have failed to explore!)*\n* Persona\n   * *(I have played Persona 3 (specifically FES), Persona 4 (specifically Golden), and Persona 5 (including Royal) so any of those three worlds are all something I am cool with exploring.*\n* My Hero Academia\n   * *(I am caught up with the manga, so let me know if you are simply an anime only or not! Don't wanna accidentally spoil some details for you ya know?)*\n* Soul Eater\n   * *(I watched the Soul Eater anime as opposed to reading the manga. I was told that there are rather apparent differences between the two narratives, so I just wished to clarify such.)*\n* Danganronpa\n   * *(I have played all three games and read Danganronpa: Zero, so I am well versed in the lore.)*\n* God of High School\n   * *(I have only seen the anime, and have not read the WebToon)*\n* One Piece\n   * *(I have read a good portion of One Piece, but am not caught up on either the anime or the manga. I don't mind spoilers however, so if we end up roleplaying this I don't mind doing research to make sure that we are both familiar with all of the concepts.)*\n\nWhew! Now I know that was a bit long, but I just really wanted to throw all of my cards on the table! I really wish to do some roleplays, so please let me know if you're interested in doing a roleplay in any of these verses! I look forward to seeing those little orange letters in my inboxes! Let me know what fandom you're interested in roleplaying in, or even if you have some roleplay ideas!",

            "selftext": "Hello!\n\nI don't make roleplay ads too often so my apologies if this is a bit shoddy. Many years ago I had a Star Wars RP with someone from a forum, a typical Sith master-apprentice type set up with the master being the GM as well whilst I played the apprentice. It was fun and well done, however, I was too inexperienced of a writer back then so it did not last.\n\nBasically, in short, I want to have an RP like that again and hopefully have it go well this time. A Star Wars Sith Master-Apprentice roleplay, likely in the Old Republic era. I'd like a partner that'll be willing to GM it as well and take the reigns of the world and story. Everything else can be discussed and planned. \n\nAs for details about myself, without revealing too much (bad experiences), I'm from South Asia, so timezones *might* be an issue if you'd like replies multiple times in the day. English is not my first language but I've role-playing for 7 years, barring me being unable to describe some things in detail or misplaced punctuation, I promise you won't struggle in understanding my writing. My posts average on 2-3 paragraphs or more, though I also match my partner's post length. I never do one-liners and I try to avoid single paragraph replies. I'd like my partner to be similar. \n\nI'm also 18+, so I don't mind darker themes in the story and it can be hosted either on reddit or Discord.\n\nSo yeah, that got a lot longer than expected and I hope I don't come off as demanding. If you're interested I hope to see you soon.",

With this, I\u2019m not at all picky about which one of us plays the athlete. Want me to be an NFL quarterback and you be my high school sweetheart? Let\u2019s do it! Do you want to be the point guard on a WNBA team and have me be the stay at home dad to our kids? I\u2019m down for that too! Or maybe I\u2019m an MLB pitcher and you\u2019re a tennis player that can stand toe to toe with Serena Williams? We can definitely go that route too! \n\nI just want to do something where we have to face and overcome the everyday challenges that these people go through, from having to spend weeks apart, to injuries, to moving, or even just bad publicity! \n\nI\u2019d love to discuss the specifics with my partner, build our characters and their backstories together, and just figure out what each other enjoys in an RP. \n\nI usually write anywhere from 1-8 paragraphs, just depending on what my partner likes. I use face claims, and also like sharing reference pictures throughout the RP, but that\u2019s optional. If I\u2019ve sparked any sort of interest in you, please don\u2019t hesitate to message or chat with me!",

Though I like to have only one main character that the rp is mostly about, I normally wind up controlling some npc\u2019s and it would be nice if you could do that too! I\u2019m super excited to roleplay so if any of this interests you don\u2019t be a stranger! Shoot me a dm!\n\nAlso the rp will be over discord.",

A girl has grown up and been raised as a solider (my OC) for the government. But goes MIA for a full two years before being found again. She is brought back in and a pyschtatrist (your OC) Is hired to remove and erase emotions and all memories through a series of medications and procedures. The pyschtatrist is hired to make sure all goes well with such and adminster most of the medications. As time goes on she starts getting gaps and such in her memories not understanding what's happening and the scientist decides to try to escape with her. Only to fail and her to get reset completely. From there he tries to slowly remind her. That's all I have planned!!! Please DM me if you are interested. And I'm not looking for NSFW!!",

I\u2019m looking for one of the two points in the time line of the universe. One being where the game is right now(The current season). If we go with this, we\u2019d mainly focus on what a Guardian\u2019s daily life would be beside all the shooting, how their relationship goes with fellow Guardians, how they deal with the guilt of not being able to save someone. Or we could have our story take place during the dark age, before the times of Guardians. We could explore what it was like for a risen to adjust himself to this harsh world he found himself in.  A little about me. I write from a few sentences to couple paragraphs depending on what is happening in the story and I\u2019m fine with whichever style you prefer. The only thing I\u2019d ask is that please don\u2019t ghost me. You can just tell me if you lost interest in it and I\u2019ll be fine with it.  And I think that\u2019s about it. Feel free to hit me up and we can discuss more.",

            "selftext": "The year is 2050. 5 years ago, a big tech company made a huge breakthrough in synthetic human, allowing them to create human-like robots that looks, acts even feels exactly like humans. They were soon put into the market, acting as replacement for human workers in dangerous fields. Since they aren\u2019t technically \u201chuman\u201d they are expendable and cheap to use. Now they are slowly trying to put them in new fields. About a year ago, they started putting these synth into the police department. Due to their expendable natures, they serve as an excellent replacement for human officers. Now every human office is issued with a synth partner.\n\nToday is a big day for you. Your first day as a police officer in New York City. When you reported yourself in, you were told your partner was waiting for you. \n\nHello! As you can see, this is a police rp, where my character being a synth and you are a human.\n\nHere\u2019s a little about me. I\u2019m a 20M living in the west coast (PST time zone). And I\u2019m currently in college but since it\u2019s online, so I have plenty of times on my hands. I\u2019m fine with whatever writing style and my response length wary from short responses to lengthy ones depending on the story.\n\nWhat I\u2019m looking for in my partner. I want my partner to be active(preferably replying within 2 hours), and I\u2019d love my partner to tell me if they are going to be away for a bit. And no ghosting, feel free to tell me if you\u2019ve lost the interest in the rp and I\u2019ll be completely fine about it.\n\nAnd I think that\u2019s it. Feel free to hit me up and we can discuss more.",

            "selftext": "It had been centuries since the war of the best. The war that decided as to whether humans would continue their roam on land or perhaps be executed by those that bared sharp teeth. The war that drove vampires of all ages into extinction. Such phenomenon, the race couldn't recover. Those to whom were alive lacked partners as such were incapable of repopulating. Those to whom were alive were forced into solitude where they slept for hundreds of years. \n\nHowever, as the future may have it, there was someone that ended up revitalizing this trend of terror. A wealthy adventurer was making their way through a frozen, serene hiking trip. This person chose the dangerous route of going solo. Unfortunately, the bad decisions chose now to catch up to them. With a slight trip, this person fell. Their body went crashing through that of an earth fissure hundreds of metres down. \n\nHowever although they've survived the fall, something was but unfortunate. They lacked the gear to escape this dark cavern they've fallen into. Furthermore, they were heavily injured. They were bleeding. Such a scent to which had awoken the nearby vampire out of her slumber. She's hungered for blood. For centuries she had to sleep in fear of dying like the rest of her kind. But now? Perhaps there was a chance. A human stumbled into her secluded residence. Perhaps she could kill them, trick them or maybe use them? Humanity had treated her kind so horribly that one could only bask in their horror. \n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nHeyo! Cru here! Hope you find interest in this one lol. It's something I just thought of! To summarize it for better understanding; Most vampires had gone extinct during that of the medieval era. However some went into an eternal slumber to preserve their bodies. Unfortunately for a certain adventurer, they had ended up falling through a fissure and inevitably into that of the vampire's lair, awakening them in the process. \n\nNow it just depends on the choices made! ^^ \n\nThis'll be a modern fantasy rp with tons of action. A roleplay where the characters slowly but surely fall for each other throughout all of their hardships. The only rule is to be literate ^^",

I am looking for a partner (or more than one, y'know) to write out stories with me set within the universe of Naruto.\n\n**Setting**\n\n* Naruto / Boruto (Uzumaki Naruto)\n\nI am indeed looking for some more Naruto roleplay featuring The Best Boy. I'm particularly interested in someone willing to follow a few specific details (listed below) while being open to ideas - such as AUs. I also would prefer someone who is open to taking Naruto far more seriously than Kishimoto did. Proper characterization, addressing the *dark* stuff that went down, and ignoring the Otsutsuki entirely.\n\n~~Also it helps if you recognize Hiruzen as a bad guy.~~\n\nIn terms of ships (canon characters)? I am particularly looking for almost any character at the moment. This can be Ino, Kurotsuchi, Tenten, or whoever (within certain limits!) that could be fitting. I have a list of plots and ideas in my head for this. I may be open to OCs, but this will be rare due to my experiences.\n\n*ADDENDUM 6/9/21:*\n\nCurrently not looking for Sakura - I'm content with the NaruSaku roleplay I've got going on right now.\n\nCurrently not looking for Hinata - I am content with the NaruHina I've got going/got in planning.\n\n\n**LOOKING FOR / DETAILS:**\n\n* Third-person perspective writing, Multi-para length\n* Discord-based roleplay\n* Canons focused, but may accept OCs.\n* Alternate takes/universes only!\n* Male x Female romance please!\n* Would like to talk / RP often. Even if its just plotting &amp; planning.\n* I am up for potentially doing multiple RPs at once.\n* I am willing to discuss potentially doubling, but I make no promises.",

In terms of post length, it should be at least semi-lit; a solid paragraph or two is the general aiming point for me, though it can go longer/shorter when the scene calls for it. I'm 22 and in the EST time zone, but don't really care what time zone you're in.\n\nAs my title indicates, the plot I have in mind is that of a deity descending to earth to experience mortal life (albeit with all the perks and powers that come with being a goddess.) I'm looking to play this goddess myself, and I'd like your character to be a regular mortal that my character ends up essentially living and/or traveling with as a mortal guide to Earth. This can be a fantasy setting, however, if you want to include other races like elves and the like; you needn't be a human, just mortal. But a plain old modern day Earth works too! This'll be largely slice of life, probably, but I'm open for more than just that if you'd like some action and stuff.\n\nIf you're interested, please do message me! I only RP on Discord.",

            "selftext": "Hello! 24F looking for a long term 19+ roleplay partner. My timezone is : GMT-4. I would like to find someone who is active, and literate. Please do not reply if you do not have decent writing skills or if you're only looking to reply once daily. I am a very understanding person, so I do understand that we all have lives, and I do as well so please be respectful of this.\n\nI am interested in roleplaying my OC against Eddie Brock and eventually Venom. I have based my AU with the characters from the 2018 Venom movie starring Tom Hardy. I would like to have an established relationship between the OC and Eddie before Venom comes into the picture, like in the movie, except they would stay together. In this AU, Anne does not exist. I am interested in exploring how Eddie would react once he got Venom and has fears for his significant other's safety because of this, but definitely does not want to be without her. I would also love to explore how Eddie reveals Venom to her, how Venom is welcomed, and integrated into their relationship. I adore Eddie and Venom's dynamic, I love how they interact in the movie and I thought it would be interesting to see what it would have been like if Eddie was in a relationship during this major life event.\n\nAll that being said, I am 100% open to discussing this with you before starting anything. I would love to hear your thoughts, ideas and preferences! I have been doing written roleplay for at least 5 years. If I write long detailed responses and I expect the same in return. I understand that sometimes shorter responses are required in order to advance the story, so no worries there!\n\nRoleplays are done on discord only. Thank you for reading, feel free to reach out to let me know if you are interested \ud83d\ude0a",

            "selftext": "Good afternoon! My name is Kire, I am 30 years old and looking for people 24 or older to Roleplay with - the age requirement is due to my personal taste, not for any other reason. **I just don't feel comfortable talking to anyone under 24.**\n\nI've been Roleplaying since I was 9 years old back on Neopets and DeviantArt. I am looking for someone **strictly literate** who knows how to write a story, not an essay. At least three paragraphs per reply - no RPer can reply to a few sentences let alone a single paragraph if we are expected to progress the story.\n\nMy rules are quite simple: be literate, be willing to talk outside of RP (OOC for example), be patient (I work full time and go to college full time), and be open!\n\nI have a couple of fandoms I'm super interested in doing, along with the characters I play; **BOLD** are characters I'm looking for:\n\n\\- **Overwatch** (Jesse\\[**GENJI**/**HANZO**(AU only)\\], Angela\\[**GENJI**\\], Gabriel\\[**MOIRA**/**AMELIE**\\], Olivia\\[**GABRIEL**\\])\n\n\\- **Villainous** (Dr. Flug\\[**BLACK HAT**\\])\n\n\\- **Team Fortress 2** (Soldier\\[**ENGIE**/**MEDIC**\\], Pyro\\[**ENGIE**\\], Scout\\[**SNIPER**\\], Sniper\\[**SPY**\\], Spy\\[**SNIPER**\\], Medic\\[**HEAVY**/**SOLDIER**\\])\n\n\\- **Homestuck** (John\\[**DAVE**\\], Karkat\\[**ERIDAN**/**SOLLUX**/**DAVE**\\], Sollux\\[**ERIDAN**\\])\n\n\\- **Boku No Hero Academia** (Hawks\\[**DABI**\\])\n\n\\- **Borderlands \\[1, 2, Pre, Tales, and 3\\]** (Rhys\\[**JACK**\\], Handsome Jack\\[**RHYS**\\], Mordecai\\[**BRICK**\\], Gaige\\[**KRIEG**\\])\n\n\\- **OFF** (Zacharie\\[**BATTER**\\])\n\n\\- **Phoenix Wright** (Phoenix\\[**EDGEWORTH**\\])\n\n\\- **I have many other fandoms, just ask!**\n\n# Please no OCs! I have never had a good experience with them so I'm just omitting them entirely. Sorry in advance!\n\nI have a few ideas for Fandom AUs that I really, really want to do!\n\n\\- **PIRATES** (Character X is a pirate. Character Y is a rich brat of the royal family. We can totally add mythical creatures into this like sirens, mermaids, a kraken, etc!)\n\n\\- **DEMON HUNTER** ( Character X is a hunter and Character Y is a demon that Character X sealed away to be their partner - Y doesn't want to be X's partner at all and does everything in his power to defy X. More brainstorming later)\n\n\\- **Dystopian** (Basically the world has ended because bees died out and now the rich are basically living in a utopia above the clouds with man-made bees and the rest of the world lives under the smog cloud where Honey and anything made by bees - fruit, vegetables, etc - is currency.)\n\n\\- **Medieval Fantasy** ( brainstorm!!!! )\n\nThat's all I've got! I RP over Discord so please send me a small snippet of how you RP and your discord name so we can chat more! \ud83d\ude0a",

My responses range from one para (five sentences) to three para (fifteen sentences. I\u2019m up for a both writing based rp on discord to a writing style in Reddit PMs. And please write third person!\n\nSo as for the story idea I\u2019m looking for a mafia based rp. A skilled and rather veteran assassin of the mafia (your OC) is tasked with taking down and killing the youngest assassin (my OC) who works as a card dealer in a hotel. When he\u2019s about to end her she spills secrets about the mafia itself and also about herself and parentage which is why they want her gone. As the older assassin slowly realizes this he takes the girl to run and I don\u2019t have much planned past that! PM me if interested!!!",

            "selftext": "Hello roleplayers. Hope you're having a good day ! \n\nThis is just an idea for a play and is not complete. Also, it can be a bit overwhelming. Now, the idea goes as follows:\nMy character and you character were travelling on a ship, get caught in a massive storm and consequently shipwreck and are washed onto an uninhabited island. There is no news of the other people on the ship, to us. I would like to play myself as my character, a 20 year old college student. I want your character to me much older than me, and maybe married. The details of your character is up for discussion.\n\nThe story starts from them waking up on the shore. So this play is going to be their story on this island. I want this to be detailed and real. Your character can have children (younger than me) as well, that might turn interesting as we progress in the play. The story will be of them exploring the island, surviving in this new place after coming in terms to their loss. The relationship that these two build, their adventures and the incidents happening on the island. Despite the age difference, both of them grows to like each other and this turns into something passionate. She might even be twice his age, but eventually he becomes her man, her partner -replacing her previous partner who she might not see again. This is going to be their story. \n \nSo, this is the basic Idea that I have in mind. As you can see, it is nowhere complete and the possibilities are endless. Maybe they are not alone and her husband/partner is washed up on the island with them and my character have to win you over. Maybe they are rescued, but they don't want to give up on the what they've built during their stay here. This can be a survival story. This can be the story where they repopulate the island, and 'colonize' it. I just want this to be long term , descriptive and involving world-building. We'll brainstorm ideas together (my brain can't come up with ideas on it's own, i know it's a bummer) and continue the play. \n\nAlso, a bit about me :\nI'm Kevin (I also go by Jeevan here) and I'm 20. I consider myself semi-lit and can play multiple characters in first or third person. My response ranges from three to five sentences during back and forth conversations, to one to two paragraphs when detailing is required.",

            "selftext": "Loaded title, I know\n\nFirst off, introduction. I'm 25 and have been RPing on and off since high school from forums to forums, but never thought about using reddit for RPing. I've dabbled in both group and 1on1 RPs, and has been leaning on the latter due to my schedule constraint, so here I am. The next bit is going to sound a bit pretentious, but I find it easier to just include these.\n\n Some data about my roleplaying tendencies, none are in order of strength.\n\n**Posting Speed:** One Post a Day to A Few Posts a Week, depending on my schedule and works.\n\n**Where do I RP:** Private Conversation, or Messengers. I prefer messengers, and my preferred one is Discord, but I also have Line. I can do e-mail as well if you so choose.\n\n**Writing Levels:** Intermediate to Adept. Most posts will be around 500 words or around 3 paragraphs. This can be more or less, depending on the mood, situation, your reply/what I can reply to, or whether there's a need for worldbuilding.\n\n**My Post Length Comfort:** Multiple Small Paragraphs to Multiple Large Paragraphs.\n\n**Multiple Characters &amp; NPCs:** I CAN play multiple characters but prefer not to unless there is a special case. I am fine with playing NPCs and stuff.\n\n**Character Archetypes:** Tomboyish girl, aloof and uncaring, apathetic but can be excitable on certain topic type\n\n**Character No-Gos:** Overly sweet and fluff, prideful and boastful type, preachy or overly philosophical type\n\n**RolePlaying Style- Passive or Aggressive:** Both, leaning towards middle, as in I can both do worldbuilding and story development (active), but I would prefer if you could also contribute in both worldbuilding and story development.\n\n**Favorite Genres:** Fantasy, slice-of-life, war romance, action-oriented, organized crime, star-crossed lover (like a mafia and a police kind of thing)\n\n**Genre I DON'T Like:** Horror, straight up fluff and no conflict, one-meet-love (so I need some development before being the lover)\n\n**Plot Candies:** Guns, katanas, romance, action battles, organized crime settings, maniacal laughter and unhinged kind of antagonist (or being one), tomboy\n\n**Plot Balance:** More plot than romance. I love romance, to the point where it's rather mandatory for me, but I do want the actual plot to happen as well. About 80% plot and 20% romance\n\nI do not expect you to fit my standard to RP with me, but it would be much better if you do. Basic literacy is definitely a must, and I will sometimes point out if you've done something wrong, like typos, tenses, structures, and such. I might be able to overlook some stuff, but I will definitely point out the glaringly obvious stuff, especially one that would change the meaning of a sentence. I demand substances from your reply, at the very least something for me to write about in reply. If I ask a question to your character, the least you can do is to answer that question, then ask a question back, or at least write something that requires a reaction. If you can't write that much of a substance, please take a break, then come back again once you've freshened up. I'd rather wait more than a week for a short but full of substance post, than a no substance post every day.\n\n\nStill here? **Great!** Now on to the subject of RP itself. Do mind that this is just a basic idea of the premise. The actual settings would be up for discussion between us, or it could be changed completely, this is just the general tone that I'm looking for.\n\n*It's the year 2144. The century hasn't really been kind for humankind, despite the significant technological advances that they reached during the 21st century, or rather, precisely because of it. The scientist, those most of whom has already emigrated to a safer location, Mars, predicted that comes the end of the 22nd century, Earth would be just as habitable as mercury, just with much more dust and violent storm and much less heat, but even the last part is still being contention. Yet, you don't just get a free pass to emigrate, giving the impression that they just want a social class-based cleansing. Leave the middle to lower class onto the forsaken planet, replace the labor force with androids, and fly off into god knows where. Still, it's not all as bad as it seems. There are still some scientists that believed that there's a way to save the earth, and some that even dared to stay on earth to prove it. There are also those who have emigrated, who are currently trying to change how the system works from inside the comfort of the orbital so that those left back on earth can have a better chance of surviving. If the people would just work together, and help the scientific progress, perhaps there's a good chance that the Earth would be restored.*\n\n*However, that's not the case at all. Instead of banding together to preserve whatever left of our green Earth, the remaining people who stayed on the Earth banded within their own group under the surviving megacorporation, and fought with the other group for the remaining scrap of resources, fueled with the usual mega-corp greed, amplified by the fear of the time bomb that is the Earth's lifespan. Thankfully, this full frontal conflict ended by the end of the 21st Century, and the plethora of megacorporation throughout the battered Earth had reached a truce agreement. Problem is, this agreement was reached only after several nukes dropped throughout the world, reducing the already sparse land and resources into radioactive waste. This worsened the air quality of the already dust-filled air of Earth, reducing the remaining population into a fraction of what it used to be. If it weren't for the help of the off-world scientist developing the technology to filter out air and to produce practically limitless food and water supply through the material rearranger, Earth would've been human-free by the dawn of the 22nd century.*\n\n*This technology brought about the era of domed cities, sprouting up from the remnants of the old capitals, constructed and funded by the megacorporations. The lucky people from the dust-era, referring to the years without the domed cities, got a place within the very limited domed cities, who then birthed a new generation who lived completely within that dome, or the 'humans'. The rest of the people either died a painful death from the air or just plain murder, or adapted to the new abandoned environment, becoming the 'dusts', as these people are seen as less of a human by the mega-corps. General consensus was, and still is, if you're the dusts, you hate these mega-corps with every fiber of your being, while if you're the humans, you love these mega-corps for not only housing you but also helped the scientific breakthrough making your life much easier. Artificial limbs that operate almost organically, high-power renewable energy source, material rearranger that produces actual food and drinks with tastes, and the defense system that allows the humans to live with no worry of anything that happens outside their literal bubble.*\n\n*The harsh truth, however, that whatever the humans get within their dome, was scrounged up from outside the dome. Despite the truce arrangement, plenty of PMOs started appearing throughout the world, answering the call of the mega-corps requesting for resources. These PMOs would then scour the ruined cities, dig underground, search the dried seas, or simply steal from less protected domed cities, or dusts settlements for the materials. Due the lack of said resources to begin with, this arrangement gave birth to further conflict, now between the PMOs, one that's fought from within a giant mech. The usage of these giant mech initially starts as a simple mining machine, enabling the user to travel far and bring back tons of materials, which was required due to the long distance between civilizations from any remaining source of materials. These mech would meet other mech from other PMO/mega-corp, and would duke it out for the resource, resulting in further development of the combat capability of these mechs, leading into an even deadlier war compared to the previous one.*\n\nSorry for the wall of text, but I hope that you'll find it interesting. If you do, shoot me a PM and we can discuss it further!",

I\u2019m open to anyone, as long as you\u2019re truly literate and response and like to chat ooc about our characters and just life.\n\nI\u2019m not dead set on Wild West, I\u2019m actually country myself, been around horses and lived and worked at ranches for years now, so it doesn\u2019t have to be Wild West, it could be anytime 1800s to like 1980s if you wanted.\n\nI just want some supernatural elements mixed in, the extent of that we can discuss. But like you know werewolves, voodoo, some mild magic, undead, people who have connections to spirits, ghosts, demons, and whatever else I\u2019m not picky. \n\nI\u2019m also not picky on the type of relationship but I absolutely do want it to involve romance. Whether it\u2019s MxM, FxF, MxF, or your character is trans or nonbinary, I could care less. As long as they have chemistry.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d be interested. I\u2019m ONLY looking for 18+. I do have several characters in mind and several themes I\u2019d like to include and I definitely am into horses so I want horses to be involved but that might be obvious. I do really want world building to be a big aspect here, like the laws of the world, how each type is treated, if humans know about them and how that all is, if this is located in America or a fictional world, etc.",

            "selftext": "Ive wondered how it would be like to do an rp with my character and with someone who is either blind or deaf. To see what it would be to try and make friends with her, maybe something even more!\n\n\nStuff about me:\n\nIm female\u00a0\n\n19\n\nBritish\u00a0\n\nI write in 3rd person \n\n1-2 paragraphs \n\n\nMy\u00a0 Oc \n\nName: Kendall O'connor\u00a0\n\nAge:18\n\nGender:Female\u00a0\n\nSpecies: Wolf human hybrid \n\nPhysique:Ears and tail are black fur. White skin and dark brown eyes. Face shape is like diamond and round. Her hair is dark brown and is like a pixie cut. She doesn't have a big chest and is ever so slightly muscular. Clothes wise she has a black t-shirt and a light brown jacket, blue jeans and white hightop shoes.\u00a0 She also has scars all over the top half of her body, especially one burn scar on her left shoulder blade.\u00a0\n\nPersonality: She's someone who wants to protect those close to her and make them smile regardless of the consequences she may face herself. She's kind to anyone who give back the same kindness and respect to her. There may be times when she is either weak, scared or stubborn. It just depends on the situation.\u00a0\n\nLikes: being herself, making friends, watching the rain or snow, hot chocolate.\u00a0\n\nDislikes: being disrespected, being bullied or watching her friends be bullied, getting herself hurt or anyone close to her. She doesn't like seeing anyone sad, so she always tries to cheer them up.\u00a0\n\nBackground: She grew up with only her father in her life. But the strange this was is that her father was a human, she got the wolf side from her mother who sadly passed away moments after Kendall was born.\u00a0\n\nGrowing up wasn't easy, she had to keep her ears hidden from the other kids whenever she was in school, when they did find out though she got bullied because of what she was. It didn't change when she got older, frankly it sometimes went to the point where she was beaten up.\u00a0\n\nBy the time she was 15 she had gotten into many fights. No matter what her father tried to reason with others, it just never worked.\u00a0\n\nOnly a few nights after something terrible happened..\n\nKendall woke up to the smell of smoke and for her eyes to see her room, her home, in a blaze of fire. She quickly got out her bed and went to find her father but only to find him trapped under planks of burning wood. She tried her best to get him out but failed. \n\nThe last thing her father told her was, \"You are something more than what others see you as. You can be something greater, you just gotta push through the fear, and keep moving forward \". He gave her his ring and told her to go. \n\nShe grabbed only what was left of her clothes and a stuffed grey wolf, Winston, which she has had by her side before running out of the burning building as tears ran down her cheeks. She ran and ran as far and as fast as she could.\n\nThen forth she has always been alone, finding a way to make light of her dark past\n\nWhat you must be ok with:\n\nMe not being here all the time\n\nMy character being a wolf human hybrid \n\nNot getting into the 'youknowwhat'/characters doing it(just fade to black)\n\nWhenever you send me links for character profiles PLEASE nothing gory or dirty!\n\nMy writing amount as i write in paragraphs\n\nStaying on this platform\u00a0(No Discord!)\n\nIf you can get along with these rules then you'll be fine with me :3\nComment the word 'Okami' in the chat request",

It's been a few months since I've posted on here looking for a partner, and it's also been a while since I've actually roleplayed, but I'm back, and as you can see by the title; I'm looking for a story-driven Witcher roleplay! I'd suggest you've either read the books or played the games to get a better understanding of the world/story, but I'm not looking to write canon characters. I'd like for us both to have OCs, and to create our own plot together in the world of The Witcher!\n\nI roleplay both in first or third person, so let me know your preference. I'm also on Discord where I do most of my writing but I'm totally open on writing on Reddit. \n\nI do work overnight shifts, so I will be available during most of the day except for when I fall asleep a few hours before midnight. I try to respond as often as I can and I ask that you do as well. I'll let you know if there's a specific time/day I can't reply as well! I'm a multi-paragraph writer, and will probably not be interested if you write several sentences per reply. If we both put effort into it, we'll both have more fun!\n\nIf you're interested in writing with me, hit me up and tell me about yourself, writing style, etc! I hope to hear from you!",

            "selftext": "Hey! I have two ideas which start the same, but could go very differently. I'll post them below and let you decide which you'd rather have! As well as a potential third different idea. Please enjoy. Since I've posted 4A in the title, I'll leave the pronouns for your character as they, and refer to them as YC. \n\n\n1: The Ghost Detective. Man, YC loved those shows growing up, Ghost Adventures, all those haunted places shows. They fuelled their childhood and all their studies and writings and aspirations. As they grew, they wanted to visit haunted places. As YC became of age, they got a YouTube channel, began making a show on haunted houses, visiting various cursed or haunted places, asylums, etcetera.\n\nThough this one was haunted. Unfortunately for YC, asylum spirits aren't very forgiving, and they're left terrified and running for their life. Doors slamming in their face, no escape. Though just as the apparition raises a rusted pipe to finish the job, he begins to burn and scream in pain, before vanishing.\n\nBehind where he stood was a gorgeous woman, milky white skin and bright purple eyes. Long black hair and donned in a \u00be length black dress. Hand raised as her chant had finished, before lowering it. She spoke, purple lipstick lips that matched her eyes and the amethyst earrings in her ears. \"You shouldn't be here.\" in her thick, Eastern European accent.\n\n2: A very similar idea, but YC is more of an inept magician. Witch/warlock. Trying to banish the spirits in an area, only to be forced on the run, scared and alone as YC tries to keep using magic to keep themself alive. Before the same character banishes the spirit again.\n\n3: YC was young, scared, lost in the forest. Before they saw what was chasing them. A cruel, evil looking being. Though as the being screeched and pounced, the woman banished it. It erupted into purple flames. Though as YC grew up, they constantly remembered it. The awful being, the woman with those piercing purple eyes. The porcelain skin.. Often appearing in dreams to save them.\n\nAnd that's their life.. Until university. Making it into uni and going about their life. One night, as they went on a half drunk trip around town with friends, they decided to enter the local magic store. Mostly gems and trinket looking things. And who was at the counter but the woman who they'd seen in their dreams, not having aged a day? \n\nI have some stuff going on in life but I'll try at a minimum to get a reply a day/every two days. And I won't be able to respond to many people. But I'll try. I hope you all have a wonderful day.",

            "selftext": "He looked out over the city from the balcony of the Kings college as the sun dipped below the mountains and the sky was tainted a blood red. There would he battle this night, there was battle every night. But tonight would be worse. It had been weeks since the influence of the dark Lord began to spread. It had taken to the land like a cancer. Eating away at the every fabric of earthly reality. Live stock and beasts of burden were warped. Twisted and bent into horrid mixtures of man and beast. Dogs walked on hind legs as swine grew leathery bat like wings. Their forms were tantamount to chaos with the only common theme being that of hatred. A deep bitter hatred that ran so deep they would die to see a human injured. The kind of wrath saves only for the most repugnant of men was directed at any human who committed the crime of existing. Along with them were the tenoma. Cloaked riders who acted as the eyes of the dark Lord. From a distance you would think them a man. Until you saw that instead of eyes they had two endlessly black pits. Their steeds were as cursed as them. Some altering reality like having you hear their hoofbeats from miles away yet getting quieter and quieter as they approached. They were the commanders and their fell intellect had made many cities fall. Yet this one was different. \n\nHelmsgart was the seat of the king and his family. Here his army was in wait always ready to set the poorly armed and armoured twisted ones running. Yet even if they killed twenty foes for every life lost they would still lose thus battle of attrition. So now the college had to step in. The King's college was the height of enlightenment. A place where makes and wizards could put train and hone their craft. Once it enforced the laws which made some types of magic illegal... but now the likes of necromancy was a tool just like any other. \n\n(So here we are. Continuing from my past prompt I am hoping to do another roleplay in the same world. Instead of the small personal journey of two characters this will be a more grand affair dealing with battles, arcane and court intrigue. Who would you like to be? A royal come to check on the progress? A mage studying how to protect the city? The body guard of a mage? Or an apprentice who may just have the key to saving the land? I hope to discuss this with you. And if you wish you can check my previous prompt if you wish to play that one instead.)",

Right now, I\u2019m very interested in writing some good ol\u2019 Fruits Basket :) Specifically, I\u2019m looking for somebody who can write Shigure Soma!\n\nI\u2019m 21 years old, female and a literate writer, but I always tend to match my partner, so semi literate writers are also welcome! I can write anywhere from 2 paragraphs to novella, am super patient, and ghost friendly. I love CanonxCanon and CanonxOC, so just let me know what you want if we\u2019re doubling up :)\n\nAll I ask is that you\u2019re 18+ since I\u2019m not comfortable writing with minors, are at least semi literate, and also patient! I\u2019m pretty good at getting responses in, but 1-2 days of the week can be a little hectic for me sometimes.\n\nAs for plots, I\u2019m okay with keeping things the same as the show or doing an AU of sorts. Angst is more than okay with me, but I also love slice of life, so as long as romance is there, we can throw in whatever you\u2019d like! \n\nLastly, this is doubling friendly, so if you can write as Shigure from Fruits Basket for me, then I will write anyone in return for you (including canon characters from other universes, so ask away!)\n\nHope to hear from you!",

            "selftext": "\nHello! \n\nI\u2019m looking for a partner who wants to collaborate with me to make an enchanting story about the mafia/yakuza/bratva whatever syndicate we choose, I won\u2019t take the syndicates with too much detail or realism as I would like to have a sort of \u201cJohn Wick\u201d like universe where it\u2019s not totally accurate. \n\nAs a word of warning, the underworld is nasty, not nice and unpleasant, so there will be blood and stuff that you would expect\n\nAnyways, exciting thing about the rp is the powers! We don\u2019t have to limit ourselves to \u201cinvisibility\u201d or \u201cflight\u201d, we can do pretty much anything! Jojo-styled, bungo stray dogs style, jujutsu kaisen style, bnha style is all cool with me! Let\u2019s get creative!\n\nThe end goal of the rp is decided by us so, we can choose from an array of options. But depending on the branch or business of the syndicate you join (did I mention I\u2019m gming for you?) we can figure out what we are doing. We can even do the other side of government operated strike force to crack down on syndicates, or even an undercover agent?\n\nAnyways, if you\u2019re interested, please send me a short description of yourself with pronouns, if you\u2019re not cool with that it\u2019s no fret! After that please send me a sample writing to let me gauge how much you write on average and do we vibe. If you can\u2019t write that, please at least send me an oc with their roles and trivia and powers and such\n\nSee you soon!",

Please PM if you\u2019re interested! \n\nSo as for the story idea I\u2019m looking for someone to play the deity and/or demon. So a rather young girl. Around 16-19 is trying to live her life the best she can in New York City. Alone. She goes through daily struggles and one night when she seems to be at her lowest a rather chaotic deity (your OC) finds its way to her and gives her an offer. He can give her everything she wants in exchange for a platonic companion. Someone to make the silence a little less loud. And what happens after that is up to us! I hope you enjoy my idea!

I will be detailed no matter the part in the roleplay. I don't do one-liners just because I know I don't like it when people send me one-liners to my paragraphs. I will let one-liners slide if it's dialog back and forth but otherwise. I also play male and female characters. I don't mind doing multiple role-plays at once. Meaning if we have severe discord then that works. \n\nSo I do ask that you match some of this mostly no one-liners. Semi Detailed and that if you have a problem please tell me.\n\n I don't like when people ghost me so id rather you tell me your leaving than have me messaging thinking something happens to you. As I do tend to begin to care about the person I'm roleplay with especially if we talk outside the role plays. \n\nI have a roleplay idea but I do want to hear your ideas. And we can always do more than one too!\n\nDM me if your interested or have any questions.",

My replies usually average a few paragraphs, I will often go over the discord character limit. I don't care too much about replies being shorter or longer though, we can figure that out. I like to talk a lot and get to know someone while I write with them. Currently, I only write on Discord.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe fandoms I am writing and characters that I write are:\n\n* Marvel - Peter Parker.\n* DC Comics - Richard Grayson.\n* Star Wars - Luke Skywalker (Only Padawan Luke from pre-ESB).\n* Final Fantasy - Cloud Strife\n\nI AM NOT LOOKING FOR ANY SPECIFIC PAIRINGS, I AM OPEN TO VIRTUALLY ANY, INCLUDING ORIGINAL CHARACTERS.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI write a few custom settings too. I am open to:\n\n* Space/Sci-Fi.\n* OC Superheroes vs Villains.  \n\n\nIf you got this far, shoot me a message and we can try to figure something out! Hope you have an amazing day :)",

I\u2019m currently in a fandom brainrot so im indulging in for some fandom rps! Off the bat im only looking for two or three partners as Ill likely get overwhelmed with more then that, I like to find people I connect well with so if I don\u2019t end up role playing with you I\u2019m sorry :( I\u2019m usually pretty open with whatever character you want me to play within the series/ fandom and will tell you if I cannot play a certain character. Of course I\u2019ll link the fandoms I want to rp in below:\n\n- MHA:  CANON X OC, CANON X CANON\n(really been looking for someone to play hawks for me..)\n\n- STARDEW: CANON X OC\n\nFAIRYTAIL: CANON X CANON\n\nHAIKYUU: CANON X CANON, CANON X OC\n\nDANGANRONPA: CANON X CANON\n\n\nTHE ARCANA: OC X CANON\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAnd that is basically it! Of course we can work out characters and plot  in the dms and things like that, I have a few requirements other then that but they are fairly simple, just that I like an active partner who can write two paragraphs per post, I also only roleplay on Discord as it\u2019s my most used platform and the easiet format for me to use.If you\u2019re Intrested feel free to shoot me a message and we can go from there:)",

I don\u2019t have too many specifications, but I do enjoy detailed replies and discussing ideas! \n\nHere\u2019s a bit about me. I\u2019m a full time college student (however on break right now) and I also have two part time jobs. So needless to say I\u2019m a bit busy, but I\u2019m also very willing to reply at least a few times a day! I\u2019m just looking for someone who also has that dedication or at least gives me a heads up when they\u2019re not going to be able to respond. \n\nSome of the historical eras I\u2019d love to start a roleplay in are the Civil War, WW2, 60s-70s, Ancient Greece/Rome, Wild West, Oregon Trail, etc. I\u2019m also a sucker for slice of life, so if you aren\u2019t into historical- no problem! If you have any ideas let me know, I\u2019m really open to anything!\n\nI love slice of life, romance, action, drama, etc. Honestly, anything goes! \n\nIf this sounds like anything you\u2019d be interested in, feel free to reach out to me! :)",

            "selftext": "Hey everyone! Usually, I'd be doing something cool during summer break, but with everything still somewhat closed, I'm pretty bored. So, I was hoping to indulge in a little roleplay with a new partner! Currently, I'm looking for a dramatic, heated, slice of life roleplay. Before I talk about my prompts, I'd like to specify what I look for in a partner.\n\n* Please be 18+. This is kind of a given, but I don't intend on roleplaying with minors.\n* I prefer quality over quantity, so I usually match however much my partner gives me. Generally, I go for 1-5 paragraphs, but as long as you give me something to work with, I'll be happy.\n* Someone who doesn't ghost. Yeah, this has been said a million times, but please, if you're not happy with something, or need to take a break or anything like that, voice your concern with me. It just leaves me with some closure. \n* Someone who uses Discord, since that's my preferred platform.\n* I'm fine with both points of view, with a preference for third. If you like first more, that's totally fine by me.\n* This isn't necessary, but if you're also a student or someone on break, that would be fantastic. It would just make lining up our schedules a lot better.  \n\n\nNow, I'm looking for a Slice of Life prompt. Nothing against other genres, but I've done a little too much fantasy for now, and I'm just looking for a change of pace. I have a few starters, but I honestly think of a bunch of new ones at random, so if you didn't like any of these, message me and ask me if I have any more, \"Bonus\" ones, or if you'd like to suggest one of your own. With that out of the way, here's the ones I have in mind: \n\n**Abandonment**\n\n**1a.** In high school, our characters were a fantastic couple. Your character's grades were fantastic, and my character was likely going to go to college on a sports scholarship. On one lifechanging night in their junior year, they hooked up, and had a lot of fun. A month later, your character was cut off from mine, and ended up moving across the country a few weeks later. After asking a friend, it turned out your character had ended up having a little, \"Accident\", which was unacceptable to her very conservative parents. Five years later, when my character was back at his parents' for summer, it turned out that your character had moved back to their suburb. Along with her was a young, five year old kid. My character's child.\n\n**1b.** During my character's senior year of college, he had come back to his small southeastern town for Christmas break. On one lucky night, he met his high school crush at the supermarket, whom he talked to and hooked up with later on during his break. He flew back to his college, thinking nothing more of it, until he got a call in July, telling him that your character was having his child.\n\n**Poor college students move to a city**\n\nOur characters had dated their senior year of college, and graduated together. They decided that the two of them were close enough that they could live together, and so they did. Over the summer, they moved to a new city, bustling with activity. Broke, but full to the brim with hope, they started working together towards a life together. However, unprepared for life, both of our characters were irresponsible with the money that they should have been saving, and started fighting. Will they end up settling their arguments and being more forward thinking?\n\n**Very Generic Romance Story**\n\nThis prompt is very vague at the moment, because I'd like a lot of your input! I'd like this story to be a very realistic one. Maybe our characters meet through a friend, or by accident. I would like to see them go through a typical adult relationship, with fights and angst over money, relationships, and any other topics they may disagree on.",
