Warrior cats was the first ever roleplay I had done so it holds a special place in my heart. \n\nInfo about me: I\u2019m a 24 year old female in the US. I have been roleplaying for over a decade so I\u2019m fairly literate and prefer a partner who is as well. I realize roleplaying as cats would probably mean shorter responses but I would like someone who can still get out a few quality paragraphs per post. \n\nI see us each needing to play multiple characters to make up a Clan, though we can have anywhere from 1-3 main plots and characters if that\u2019s too overwhelming for you. \n\nI have a few quick ideas though nothing too fleshed out. I am up for playing either gender here as well. \n\nI usually use discord. If you\u2019re interested, shoot me a message! I don\u2019t usually respond to short ones so give me some info about yourself and your roleplay likes and styles. Thanks!",

            "selftext": "Hello!\n\nI am here after a super long time since I have more time on my hands now. I have always loved roleplaying and I am full of ideas and plots. (As you can see from all the prompts and plot ideas I have listed below). I have been roleplaying for a year now and had met a lot of lovely people throughout my time as a roleplayer.\n\nSo, I am back with all these ideas- looking for a partner! If you are interested, send me a message. I would love to hear your ideas and thoughts too!! \n\nI play only Female Characters by the way!! \ud83c\udf38\n\n\nPLOT IDEAS:\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Royal Arranged marriage or an arranged marriage set in a historical time period. This can be a bit dark too. A lot of things that can be incorporated into this roleplay. Maybe with a little unrequited love.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Nerd falling for Best Friend's brother at high school. This probably goes along the lines of the whole opposites attract thing. Bad boy meets good girl. High school drama. Blah blah.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Unrequited love wherein my character is in love with your character but he doesn't know it or acknowledge it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. A messy break up leads to my character not revealing to your character that she was pregnant and your character meets my character and their child years later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Steve Rogers x OC PLOT IDEA wherein Steve goes back to Peggy after dumping OC but later realizes that it was all a mistake for him to come back to her. But is it too late?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. My character and your character had dated long ago. Your character breaks up with me and gets married to someone else and has a child. Your character then loses his wife and is now a single father. My character on the other hand is married as well but is an unhappy marriage. Our characters cross paths years later and the plots builds on from there.\n\n\n\n\n\nFANDOMS:\n\n\u2022 Marvel (Steve Rogers)\n\n\u2022 Game of Thrones(Jon Snow, Ramsay Bolton)\n\n\u2022 Harry Styles too I guess haha (not technically a fandom but you get my point)\n\n\u2022 Also any Chris Evans movie character works for me (again not technically a fandom but you get my point)\n\n\u2022 Harry Potter (Draco Malloy, Tom Riddle Marvello)\n________________________________________________________\n\nI won't waste any more time of yours here. Like I said earlier if you like it, you can drop a message and we can come up with something that works for both of us! \ud83c\udf38\n\n\nTalk to you soon xx",

I've been writing my whole life, spent most of my college time as a creative writing major before pivoting into a more stable career path. I used to have a few long term partners that I'd been writing with for years but they burnt out during quarantine so now I'm struggling to find another fit. \n\nAs far as what rp I'm looking for, it's very up in the air. I'm less concerned about the \"what I'm writing bit\" than I am about WHO I'm writing with. Over the years I've found that if two partners click, you can make literary magic out of just about any prompt so. I do prefer to communicative out of character because of this and tend to like to discuss plots and prompts with my partners a bit before actually starting the roleplay. I do not have a tense or pov preferencea and while I'd prefer longer posts, as long as your response fits the moment I don't care too much about length (there is something to be said for a good ebb and flow between short and long responses!) My only must is that I only write on discord. \n\nAnyway, if you're interested just drop me a message! If not, I do hope you find what you're looking for and have a lovely day!",

You\u2019ve had your fair share of fights, being an old kingsguard. We cross paths on a job that you\u2019re also going for, and after seeing your skill I ask to shadow you and be mentored, but you\u2019re not a fan of the idea. You think I\u2019m just another naive girl who\u2019ll slow you down, until you see that I have access to healing magic, something that hasn\u2019t existed since the previous royal family was usurped. Although you despise magic, maybe the usefulness and implications of who I am exactly make you curious enough to keep my around \n\nAgain, I\u2019m leaving it very open ended so we can figure out the details if you\u2019re interested, I\u2019m totally open to having monsters like goblins or elves exist in this world, but I do want a strong basis in reality as well.

I try to match length, but I can\u2019t do that if you send me 5 paragraphs describing a room.

I can do human, but mostly do serious fantasy (like for vampires, think Interview With The Vampire. Immortal/Fantasy races experience hardships and I like to focus on that). I do work with a lot of darker themes and those elements are kind of all I do (especially with relationships), just to add some conflict. So I'm not really looking for a happy/fluff rp. I\u2019ll have a list of prompts ready!\n\nAlso, PLEASE let your characters have a personality besides \u2018toxic prick\u2019. Give them motive! You\u2019re totally welcome to edit a pre-existing OC! Note that MY characters will be on the receiving end of the toxicity.\n\nThis would include things like toxic relationships, which I plan to have as a MAIN THEME. We\u2019re going to be traumatizing some poor OC here, be up for that. Note I am perfectly ok with having multiple roleplays with one person. Please have photos of all your characters, you don't need a bio. Edited/found photos and personally drawn photos are perfectly ok.\n\nI use discord exclusively to roleplay.

If you are below 18 I will not do any romance/violence/dark themed prompts with you. I will gladly do a family friendly rp so still feel free to message me!*\n\n**About Me-** I\u2019m 18, female, and I\u2019m a student. I prefer multi para. to novella length style. Good grammar and punctuation is always good too. I don\u2019t mind talking outside of the rp but it\u2019s not a must. I like to create the background and story with my partner however. \n\n**What I Like-** I love, love, love romance so if that was included that would be great! Super natural is always fun! Mythical is just as good! I also adore a good ole slice of life. Oh, and who doesn\u2019t love a comedy? I like horror too, spooky spooky. \n\n**Prompts**\nYou can send me your prompts if you want or I have some of my own! \n\n\nThis was her first day at her new job, at the aquarium. She had always dreamed of working with marine animals and now she finally could! As her boss was giving her tour of the place they passed a room that a single tank. It was absolutely massive and filled with dark murky water. The only thing her boss said about it was to ignore it and that the room was off limits. The first week of the job was amazing, but even though she loved  it there she could drop the feeling of being watched by something or someone...\nMerman x human \n\nYour finally saved up enough money to buy a IBot. All the rich people have them and now you were gonna have one to. It would be perfect. The IBots clean, cater to your every need, and would even have dinner ready before you even got home. Perfect... but why is it asking so many questions? It seems like it\u2019s developing feelings... you knew you shouldn\u2019t have bought it off that weird site but it was just so much cheaper. \nRobot x Human \n\nCovid has made it increasingly hard to keep up with rent, so you had to do the thing you never thought you have to. Get a roommate. You had a spare bedroom so it wouldn\u2019t be too bad. You just needed to find someone that seemed like a good fit. Deciding to advertise online you were surprised when someone got back to you almost as soon as you\u2019d posted. Chatting with them back in forth you\u2019d decided they were worth meeting, so you invited them to check out the place. Excited that it seemed this easy to find a roommate you eagerly awaited their arrival. Maybe you could even make a new friend? So what happens when the new \u201cbro\u201d turns out to be a girl practically begging you to give them a chance?\n\nI have other romance prompts that you can ask about as well!

            "selftext": "Hello friends of Reddit! \n\nI\u2019ll be honest, I have a short attention span and an imaginative mind. This typically leads me to get really motivated to do a certain roleplay, but have a hard time carrying it out for an extended amount of time. \n\nSo I thought, why not find someone I really enjoy talking to and roleplaying with, and do multiple ideas together? We can start a roleplay that lasts a few days, a few weeks, even a few months. But if we have a new idea or just aren\u2019t feeling it any more, then we just move on. Simple as that. \n\nFor some info, I\u2019m a 24 year old female in the PST zone of the US. I have been roleplaying for 10+ years and would like an experienced partner who can write multiple paragraphs per response. For this one, it\u2019s also important that we get along and can be friends since we\u2019ll be throwing out plenty of ideas. \n\nI like to play female but since this is short term I\u2019m also happy to play male for some of these roleplays. I really enjoy fantasy, adventure, even slice of life at times. I\u2019m a big fan of complicated characters who develop over the roleplay and have even more complicated relationships with each other. \n\nThere are also a few fandoms I enjoy, which I\u2019m happy to tell you or you can also look at my post history. I\u2019m up for pretty much any time era here. \n\nAnyway I\u2019ll stop rambling. If you\u2019re interested, send a message and tell me a little bit about yourself! I don\u2019t reply to short messages, sorry. Also, I mainly use discord. Thanks for reading!",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone! After losing contact with my primary roleplaying partner a couple months ago, I figured I could try getting myself out there again. The first bit is about me specifically, but if you'd like to skip to the roleplay details, scroll down past the first paragraph.  \n\n\nI usually go by K, and I'm an 18 year old, female grocery store attendant! I've been roleplaying since 3rd grade; now I'm out of highschool, so it's been quite a journey up until this point. I'm looking to go into college after a gap year, since figuring out what you'd like to do first is pretty important, and I'm pretty indecisive &gt;&lt; I also adore fiction in all forms, and I do plenty of development and art for my projects! Just a quick note: OOC, I talk in all lowercase, and word things a bit more casually! That's sort of just how I write to friends and partners :D  \n\n\nNow to the fun stuff! In terms of what I'm looking for, I'd be fantastic to have a partner that's flexible and active. I don't expect constant back and forth conversation, but it'd be nice to keep in touch, and potentially become friends with you guys. Genre wise, I prefer SOL, fantasy, western, historical, anime-cliche stuff, and fandom content. That being said, I'm always open to new things!! In a bit of an extension from the first paragraph, I would also love to do art of our characters, as well as develop them OOC. That's probably my favorite part, not gonna lie!  \n\n\nIf you all have any questions, or want to get things rolling, please send me a message with a bit about you! I probably won't respond to comments )): but I will try my best. Please feel free to write as much or as little as you'd like; just as long as I know who you are, I'm sure we'll get along.  \n\n\nHope to see you soon &lt;3",

I thought it was nice to give some sort of teaser to a 'backstory.' your character and mine would eventually meet along the way and fight this broken world together. and sooner or later, they maybe even find hope and comfort through one another. \n\nI am 19, prefer writing in third person and usually adjust my length to my partners. as long as there's something I can work with, I'm not too picky on the length but I do enjoy some details and effort. My options to rp are here on reddit or on discord. I am searching for someone who is willing to dive into this, maybe develop an even more thought out plot and eventually play it out with me. I just miss getting lost into a story and using some ideas. the only thing I ask for is honesty. If you\u2019re not enjoying it, we don\u2019t click or whatever else is going on please just let me know. getting excited and planning over what could be and then never getting to do execute it gets exhausting sometimes. \n\nI know I didn\u2019t say much about the story itself just yet but that\u2019s because I would love to build it and work on it with you! If there\u2019s any chance that this caught your interest feel free to send me a message and ask me questions if you have some! oh and one more note, I would appreciate it if you could introduce yourself at least a little. for now have a great day/night though and thank you for your time :)",

Also im kinda sad because of roleplay of this kind i really enjoyed just ended...anyway! The plot is simple, a Vampire meets another person (prefferably non-vampire) and they fall in love. Of course not instantly, i prefer it more slow burn. About a specific plot can be talked later, i got some ideas. I can do mutiple paras or one-line, whatever the roleplay requires. Also im not a huge fan of drama but some is okay, makes it a bit more exciting. For any questions please just open a chat, theres a good chance im going to see comments or DMs way, way later than chats. I mainly roleplay on discord but if you only have reddit thats cool too.",

            "selftext": "Hey, everyone. These days I'm usually looking for fandoms, and I do have several strong cravings in previous posts that you can check out if you're so inclined - but I also periodically decide to resurrect all my old original concepts on the off chance I might find another really great partnership (or two). Hopefully I'll catch someone's eye. (:\n\nI do have a few things I'm specifically seeking in a partnership, though, so let me lay those out for you before I get ahead of myself:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. I'm looking for \"advanced/literate\" partners with as much love of the language as I have (know your possessives, \"your\" vs. \"you're,\" proper comma usage, flowing sentence structure, etc.).\n2. I only do hetero pairings, and my characters in these ideas are all female.\n3. I'm a SFW writer. Think PG-13. I love romance and conflict, but don't get gross. That said, only 18+ partners will be accepted, with 21+ preferred; I'm in my late 20s, so I don't feel comfortable writing with minors.\n4. Email is preferred, but I can do others. Just ask.\n5. I don't do one-liners. Multi-para, please. Give me something to work with (preferably without giving me eight-page novellas every post).\n6. Sometimes I disappear. It happens. I have major depressive disorder and can sometimes lack the motivation to reply. If that happens, poke me. I might say I'm not into it, or I might just be having a bad day. If it doesn't work out between us, please know that it's me - not you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll righty, so, ideas next? I think so.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**A. Moon Dancers (Medieval Fantasy):**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost of life as humanity knows it is lived during the day. The world awakens at dawn and retires at dusk, unfailingly. There are nocturnal beasts, of course, but those are just animals. And what traveler or criminal hasn\u2019t stayed up to walk by the moonlight many a time himself? Even still, night is meant for sleep and silence, and daytime for work and play. But that\u2019s not true of every sentient race in the world. There is a race of people, called the Aventine (AH-ven-teen), who not only live their lives at night, but are physically incapable of retaining consciousness in the daytime. Think of them as the \u201celves\u201d of the world \u2013 magical, fairly mysterious, largely peaceful, in tune with nature. Not a lot has been known about them over the centuries. They keep to themselves most of the time. In old days, they would even play harmless, good-natured tricks on their human counterparts, or leave playful messages, or sit and soothe a child who had awakened in the night while his parents slept on. There was goodwill between the two peoples. They were seen as anything from myth and folklore, to guardian angels, to fairies, to spirits of good fortune and blessing. But just as with anything people don\u2019t understand, mystery eventually turned to wariness. A wedge was driven between them as mutual suspicion and fear began to take root, and the \u201cMoon Dancers\u201d (humanity\u2019s nickname for them) withdrew into themselves. They have to be the more proactive in protecting themselves, after all, because of their very nature. Like I said, the Aventine are only active at night. When the morning comes, they immediately fall into a deep slumber, like flowers that only bloom in the evening. Nothing can break that sleep, and it\u2019s not possible to \u201cstay up late.\u201d They\u2019re completely vulnerable if this happens out in the world \u2013 not something you really want when the other race finds you unnerving at best and downright malicious at worst. What usually happens, and is supposed to happen, is that they retreat into the Vale, a magical place kind of existing outside the normal realm. There, they\u2019re free to sleep and dream away the whole day. Now, I have in mind to play a young Aventine woman with your typical failings of curiosity, rebelliousness, wanderlust, and inquisitiveness. She\u2019s restless with this careful life of secrecy, always watching the sleepy human towns and villages, wondering if they\u2019re really so bad. I\u2019d like the other role to be left up to you: do you want to play a human? Someone who encounters her, with ensuing potential for adventure as they learn about each other and have to protect each other from their respective peoples? Or do you want to play another Aventine who is either tasked with keeping her out of trouble or is trying to convince her because he actually cares for her, with that potential for adventure as they\u2019re discovered and cut off from the Vale and have to navigate this terrifying world ruled by humans? There are lots of possibilities here, and I\u2019d really like to brainstorm with you more about the world, the story, etc. The only thing I ask is to play against a male character, because\u2026hopeless romantic.\\~\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**B. The Wyv (Medieval Fantasy):**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are beings called Wyverns in the world. They have a form that looks like normal humans on the surface, and they were once a thriving, powerful race. They have formidable magic, live extraordinarily long lives, are even purported to have prophetic capabilities, and their other forms are similar to dragons - hence the name. Derp. They lived largely in peace with the other races of the world, even somewhat deified by mortals. A long time ago, the other races of the world started hunting them like animals, sometimes for the hide of their beast forms, sometimes to harness their magic. They were largely wiped out over the years and are now very rare and \\*very\\* hidden. A lot of people actually think they're extinct, and some don't believe they were ever anything more than legends and fairy tales. The discovery of one would be a big deal, and among nations that are in conflict, having something like that in their arsenal would give the holder quite an edge. I would like to play a young Wyv either in captivity by one such nation, or on the run from it, and I'm looking for someone to build his/her own \\*non-Wyv\\* character and collaborate on the world and story with me. I want you to have creative freedom with your character. The only thing I ask is that there be no human-animal hybrids, and no other Wyv. That would defeat the purpose.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**C. Demon Seed (Medieval Fantasy):**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, the idea is that there's this one kind of magic that is seen as unholy and evil. It's also an exceedingly rare gift; someone is born with it only once every (insert large amount of time here). There is a legend and superstition surrounding them that says they're the descendants of a demon who in ancient times came and bred with mortal races to corrupt them and steal them away from their benevolent gods. These people are referred to as demon seeds and are both hated and feared. They're seen as bringers of death and misfortune. And over the eons, this view has been supported by the seeds - because being hated and mistreated will ruin people, and many of them became the villains everyone said they were.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girl will be the current seed, shrouded in superstition, trying to make sense of what she actually is and how the world sees her. I'd like to discuss more world- and story-building with my partner and leave the other character up to you entirely.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**D. Inseparable (Medieval Fantasy):**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis one is actually the only one in which I'm not looking for romance. Rather, I'm looking for a deep platonic bond between my character, a sentient creature type, and yours, some sort of humanoid creation (the only races I'd like to avoid are the ones considered half creature/half human).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, bear with me, here. My character is a half-demon (apparently I'm in a demonic mood?) tigress. There are two \"clans,\" for lack of a better word, of feline creatures that are more than just wild animals. They're bigger, they're sentient, they can \"speak\"; think of them as more spirit creatures than animals. I gave them ridiculously corny names eight years ago when I came up with this, so I'm not going to embarrass myself by putting them here - but essentially, the panthers are bad, and the tigers are...considerably more benevolent. You do not want to run into a panther at the best of times; you only have to worry about a tiger if you've wronged them or the lands they protect. Panthers are demon-cats, like one of my tabbies would be if she had supernatural abilities. If it helps, I'll call the tigers the angels. Guardian spirits, more like.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo. My character is the product of mixed parentage. Her mother was a tiger; her father was a panther. Don't ask how that happened. The world is not black and white. She lost her mother as a cub, however, when poachers raided the glen her kind called home and pretty much wiped them out (my guess is they had some help, if you know what I mean). I would like to find someone to play a character who finds this little mystical fuzzball, \"raises her,\" probably without either of them really knowing what she is, and thus creates such a sweet, timeless bond of friendship.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe could either start with their meeting and then time-skip to adulthood a few years later, or start with adulthood. Beyond that, the challenges they face, the rest of the story, any baggage of your character's own to bring into play - that's all open and up for discussion. It's just the relationship and my own character I have.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**E. Wishes &amp; Whims (Flexible):**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I had a dream last night, and it's led me to doing some plotting and musing today. I'd like to do something involving a genie, of sorts - only not exactly the typical \"three wishes\" deal. I envision young female spirit sort of being, trapped by some great power and freed by a young man, who then becomes her \"master.\" Now, I'm not talking about \\*that\\* kind of master, so kindly get your mind out of the gutter. She would attach to him; want to do things for him and make him happy; protect him at all cost. It may be that once, these beings were in partnership with humanity (and/or other mortal races); a soul link would be created between two individuals who were compatible, and they would fight together, with the human(oid) channeling the spirit's energy. I'm thinking that there are certain people who are \\*born\\* with the innate ability to link with them. Perhaps humanity began taking advantage of this partnership/pact system, however, and began using the links to conquer instead of just protect. So, most of them abandoned humanity and refuse to pact now - but she didn't. She still believes, and is waiting for her soulmate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOr maybe she's just extremely grateful to be freed. I kind of like pact systems, and a bond growing out of that, but I'm totally open to discussion and brainstorming, too! It's just a rough idea I pulled out of the air, anyway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**F. Fish Out of Water (Realistic/Fantasy):**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(Note: This is probably the lowest on my preference list. I've had a few attempts to start it, but it always sort of falls flat. So I'd love to get a really good version going, but I'm a little discouraged about it. Keep that in mind.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is kind of a mix of modern realistic and medieval fantasy settings. It involves a young man from the \"real\" world (our world), and a girl from another world entirely; a world with magic and knights and medieval kingdoms. However, unlike your typical, patriarchal systems, her homeland recognizes equal female authority, as well as female knights and warriors. The world from which she hails is currently under threat of cataclysm, and the girl in question is one of those warriors. Though young, she was tracking down some magical doo-dad to help her country turn the tide of impending doom, but she was intercepted by a powerful sorcerer on the other side. There was a fight, and in the commotion, the artifact was destabilized, and there was an accident. She (along with the object) got dumped into another realm. Boom. Earth. She has no idea where she is, or how to navigate this odd place and its even odder customs. Enter your character. Whether he's some plain 9-to-5-er, or something more interesting - that's up to you. It may even turn out he's some special, prophesied hero in her world and doesn't know it. The point is the comedy, frustration, and emotion of the fish out of water situation. If you've seen the movie, Enchanted, you can see an example of that - though I'm not intending to play a giddy, stereotypical Disney princess. She's fiery and determined. I do want a bond to form between them, though. And eventually, I think it would even be cool to take the RP back into \\*her\\* world, where \\*he's\\* the one floundering,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**G. Reverse Phantom of the Opera (Paranormal or Fantasy):**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I've finally seen the show, and I love it, but I'm not looking for a direct copy. It simply serves as the inspiration for an idea I had; I'd like to change up the genders (i.e. female phantom) and potentially make her \\*actually\\* a ghost of sorts, or some other kind of being, \"haunting\" the theater. It's really just a rough, vague concept, but it's open to all kinds of discussion and interpretation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**H. Post-Apocalyptic:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't really too many specifics on this; it's more a general genre. However, I do not want zombies. I want something more sci-fi and dystopian than horror or fantasy. Ruined civilizations, humanity struggling to survive... That kind of thing. I have some little inklings of ideas and plot bunnies that could be taken and run with. (Rating rules still apply here, though, y'all. Don't be dumping me into a post-apocalyptic rendition of Saw IV.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I. Paranormal Collaboration:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTalking actual ghosts, here, not just things flying off shelves a la corny ghost hunting \"documentaries.\" I'd love to play a ghost against a human. I actually have a little plot bunny for this involving a ghost who doesn't know she's dead and a freelance/hobby photographer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**J. Science Fiction:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also love sci-fi and am happy to come up with an idea together. Except for my Star Trek love (Voyager), though, I'm not interested in space travel. I like artificial intelligence subjects and futuristic things, but not really keen on aliens and interstellar ambling. I do have a couple of ideas for this, including one VRMMO plot, so ask me about those.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**K. Frozen (Medieval Fantasy):**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBased on a song, not the Disney movie. This one is also not romantic, but I'm still looking for a male character. It involves twins, a young man and woman, and a massive secret kept by the sister from her brother at all cost. Historically, she had always been a happy, friendly, open girl. Suddenly, after the invasion of sorcerers and their demon familiars leads to the death of their parents, she becomes hard and closed off, but extremely protective of her brother. The exact reason remains unknown (though I'll happily tell you if you want spoilers), but the two are nearly inseparable as she tries to protect him and he tries to find his old sister once more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's based on the song, \"Frozen,\" by Within Temptation. If you listen to it, it will give you a good idea of what's going on. This is an old idea I had while playing WoW, so it's totally up for world-building and fleshing out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**L. Hand of Sorrow (Medieval Fantasy):**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you might be able to tell, this story uses Within Temptation's \"Hand of Sorrow\" as its sort of theme song. Basically, there's a guy who's more or less a champion of his people. He's a knight or something, and he has to travel to some holy site to receive his calling. He has a lover, more of a clerical type; sweet and quiet and fully supportive. She accompanies him on the trek. However, once there, they both receive a calling of different sorts. They learn that a great evil will rise and that either the man will die or the evil will. The kicker? She's supposedly the one who will bring this evil to pass and be the greatest enemy. This freaks her out, and she hides herself away in fear for the man she loves and the world. He doesn't believe it and thinks there's another way, and they set out on some adventure in search of a different answer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's room for building and fleshing out on this one, too. Fun fact: I was also inspired by Nickelback's \"Lullaby\" when I came up with this one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**M. Angels (Modern/Realistic):**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis involves a cult of of people who believe in \"mercy killings.\" The primary doctrine, or mission, surrounds providing \u201cmerciful deaths to the irredeemably suffering.\u201d Fittingly, they call themselves \u201cHeaven\u2019s Host,\u201d and the individuals responsible the actual murders are specially-trained assassins called \u201cAngels.\u201d Terminology such as \u201cmercy,\u201d \u201crelease,\u201d and \u201cfreedom\u201d are used liberally while there is not a single mention of words like \u201cmurder,\u201d showing it to be a psychological state of delusion rather than a self-acknowledged band of hit men. The members of the Host truly believe that they are doing the work of angels and profess to value peace and compassion above all else, yet outside the walls of their weekly meeting place, every person appears absolutely normal, with normal lives and responsibilities. We can play this several ways: a \"suffering\" victim and their would-be \"savior,\" two members of the cult, or a member and a former member now marked as a target because they've fled and are deemed to be suffering. I d'know. We can talk.\n\n\\~\n\nIf you're still with me, please feel free to PM me. I don't respond to comments, so please use the PM function. Thanks!",

Unfortunately, things slowed to a complete and utter stop in my previous relationship and not only were hearts frozen over, but they were tapped with a hammer and they shattered. We said goodbye. And again, I was alone. This, though, was an opportunity waiting to happen, and one that awoke the two strongest and most primal feelings I have ever felt in my lifetime.\n\nYou and I have known each other forever. Since we were really young kids. We became best friends after we sat next to each other in kindergarten and held onto that bond stronger than anything else until high school. Unfortunately, due to a growing number of others with similar interests to our own, we stopped talking as much. And stopped hanging out entirely. This distance though, became very very important. As I saw you in the halls time and time again before graduation, I realized that I missed you. I missed that friendship and I missed your laugh. Maybe I missed the idea that something more than a friendship could come to pass? No...that\u2019s silly. Or, at least it was before now. It\u2019s a few years after graduation and we\u2019ve reconnected somewhat over text, but still haven\u2019t seen a trace of one another in person for close to 3 years. I\u2019m newly single and while you\u2019re no stranger to the idea of romance or the world of lust, you\u2019ve not had anyone on your arm for a good while.

I\u2019ve been incredibly busy, unable to do rp for a little while and that has meant I\u2019ve had plenty of fleeting moments to imagine what I could do if I had time. What little spare time I\u2019ve had has been spent rewatching Samurai Champloo. Throughout doing this I\u2019ve been having many ideas, inspirations and such and finally have managed to craft an original setting with many original characters populating it. There\u2019s many storylines that could be explored, many characters to meet, many things to do...all my world is missing is a protagonist to venture through it! And that\u2019s where you come in!\n\n\nThe setting is very similar to the show\u2019s setting, no futuristic laser beams or ridiculous stuff! Good old sword on sword combat...unless you don\u2019t use a sword. Normally I\u2019d ask you to make your oc before you message me but for this setting I\u2019ve planned out a lot of the world, so preferably I\u2019d send that information to you then you could use it to adapt an existing oc into it or create an oc based off the setting description! Simply message me and provide a summary of what drew you to my prompt, your age, your time zone and your best knock knock joke! I\u2019m hoping we don\u2019t just have a strictly rp relationship, a little chatting could be fun too! Once I have all that I\u2019ll send you the world info and you can build a character based off that! Plenty of information on regions, cultures and such for you to take into account!\n\n\nI tend to write in 1-2 decently long paragraphs! Some part of the rp will be full of action, Some full of comedy, some full of drama! Even romance if you want! Theres plenty to take care of! I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be able to ! I hope to hear from ya\u2019ll! Please no super boring edgy ocs please!  No sons of demons or people with blades made of shadows. If we have rped before I\u2019ll happily still talk! Things have been a little hard for me but I\u2019m much more available now I pinky promise! Things can really get rolling! I tend to rp on other platforms, so if you have any do let me know as it\u2019s easier to organise things if they aren\u2019t simply in reddit dms. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll find one, I have most major ones!\nHope to hear from you all soon!",

I am up late due to work and I\u2019m an early riser. I roleplay mostly male but I\u2019ll do just about any side character we add into the roleplay. I love to do a range of role plays from Slice of Life, to mysteries, westerns, or fantasy Fandoms (star wars, just about any anime, Harry Potter, etc.) with any OC or characters from the books or movies or shows. I love to add a ton of drama and twists to them. If you want to roleplay message me! I am free most of the time and look forward to creating something wonderful! Can\u2019t wait to meet you! I have a couple ideas in mind they\u2019re mostly slice of life\u2019s but I\u2019m open to anything. These aren\u2019t set in stone they are open for change. And if you have any idea you want to try please let me know!!\n\nSports Star x wife/girlfriend \n\nMarvel/DC crossover- this is a weird random idea I\u2019ve been wanting to do for a while. \n\nSpace Adventure/odyssey- something to do. With long travels a whole universe we can create together. \n\nVampire x human- kinda cliche and overdone but I kinda want to play the human since I\u2019m always the vampire lol\n\nSuperhero X Ordinary human- a random idea I\u2019ve had for about a literal minute lol. It\u2019s a romance showing the struggles of dating a hero when you\u2019re a regular human. I\u2019d be okay with playing either role. Kinda interested in being the human but hero is fine too. From marvel or DC or any universe is fine even OCs if you have em!\n\nMilitary husband/wifeXSoldier- I don\u2019t mind being either character. This is more of a slice of life or a war love story if you\u2019d prefer that too lol it\u2019s just an idea I had at 3 am lol \n\nFairytail- or any anime other anime I\u2019m down to do intend to do OC\u2019s though I find it a little more comfortable and flexible.\n\nThese are just suggestions if you like one I don\u2019t mind doing one of your ideas! \nI look forward to hearing from you!",

I enjoy romance to my roleplays, but I highly prefer F/F, although I am not against F/M if I come to like the character. Naturally, romance would need to be built up towards. Action, angst and adventure are a big go for me. I am not against NSFW roleplay, but 1. my partner would need to be above the age of 18 and 2. I'd need to be comfortable with my partner to do this.\n\nHope this piques y'alls interest!",

            "selftext": "World War 2 MxM prompt!\n\nHey, I\u2019ve been meaning to do this plot for ages now. Before getting into the prompt, here\u2019s a few details I\u2019d need in a partner\n\n*Please be Semi-lit at least. I know semi lit has a few definitions nowadays, but I usually write anywhere between a paragraph and up to 3 long paragraphs.\n\n*Be 18+ there isn\u2019t really an argument there, but I feel like it still must be said.\n\n*I only role play on discord, so please keep that in mind.\n\n*My plot details are not set in stone, I\u2019m always ready to listen to different ideas and brainstorming. If there\u2019s something you dislike about the plot, feel free to talk about what you\u2019d like to change. I\u2019ll always be responsive to your ideas.\n\n\nSo here goes:\n\n\nI\u2019m looking for someone who\u2019d be down to do a Role play set in world war 2! I would like to do a pretty simple plot, I would play a German Luftwaffe solider that\u2019s basically brainwashed out of his mind. He believes everything the his cause stands for since it was the only thing he knows. He fails a mission and finds his way stranded and injured in the plains of the south of France. He would be lost and injured before seeing your character (an Allied soldier or medic, he could also be a French villager if that\u2019s what you\u2019d prefer.) My character would basically be rescued by yours. It would start as pure hatred before it slowly forms into true affection after multiple confrontations where both characters would protect one another. My character\u2019s point of view would change the more he would get closer to yours.\n\n\nThank you for reading, if you find the idea interesting, feel free to DM or comment. I hope you have a fine day or night wherever you are :)",

Or maybe you're willing to do what it takes to obtain that top spot in the weekend Dueling Club rankings, even if it means sabotaging your closest competition?\n\nIf this sounds like fun to you, I'd love to have a go with this long term RolePlay scenario.\u00a0\nThis would involve us creating new main characters outside of the Harry Potter story line and putting them through the paces of their own entirely new adventure and challenges.\u00a0\n\nObviously there is more planning to discuss moving forwards, but finding a willing participant(s) would be a start. I'm intending on using Discord as the story platform.\n\n\u00a0Please feel free to message me, or respond to this owl post if you are interested.\nThanks!\u00a0",

            "selftext": "Hello! I have been roleplaying for a couple of years now, i'm a twenty-one years old person from Europe. I'm not a native English speaker so sometimes i make some mistakes, i'm trying to keep them at the minium. I'm looking for a partner in crime to create a romantic story, i don't mind males, females or anything in between.\n\nMy writing style: I usually use the third person and past tense, my replies are usually 100-300 words but they can be longer. I always try to keep my writing as detailed as possible.\n\nAbout the roleplay: It can be medieval, steampunk, modern, historical, futuristic. I won't play fandoms, i'm not a huge fan of them. I prefer to create with my partner our world and characters.\n\n---\n\nThese are a couple of my ideas with an introduction. \n\n**[Medieval] Stolen heart**\n\nThis scenario is about a thief and a princess, they meet in her chamber when he was trying to stole her jewelry. This story could be everywhere, it is up to us. We can even make the princess a prince and the thief a woman.\n\nIntroduction:\n\nThe cold wind of winter was blowing inside one of the castle's chamber pushing some papers on the floor, the sound of someone walking on the marble floor was slightly audible. The thief was searching in every drawer, the bag was full of jewels but he wanted more, he wanted to stole everything he could. The dinner usually lasted for one entire hours so he had time... at least it was what he thought. The ebony door suddenly was opened, his emerald eyes searched for a way out but he was too far away from the window. He had to quickly make a decision. When the door was closed he rushed towards the person who just entered in the room and he pinned their body on the wall, his hand was over their mouth. His eyes widened, she was the princess/prince.\n\n**[Modern] The newcomer**\n\nThis scenario is set in a highschool or college, the story begin in the second semester when my character goes for the first time in his new school. Your character could be a student or a teacher or whatever you want. \n\n\n**[Anything] Bring your own idea!**\n\n---\n\nPlease send me a PM if you are interested in roleplaying with me. Send me a little description of you and in what types of scenarios are you interested. Have a nice day.",

            "selftext": "Hi there! This is my first roleplay partner seeking post so, go easy on me. \ud83d\ude2c Also, those new to roleplaying are welcome as well. I won't mind introducing someone to rp or helping someone grow into roleplay. I'm also open to roleplay on Discord or Snapchat. I do have to mention that I'm looking for a long term partner.\n\nFirst off, a bit about me. I am female, 21 y/o, a native English speaker and I've been doing rp for 5 years, going on 6.  I'm located in the GMT/UTC +2 timezone however, I'm very flexible. So, whether you're 8 hours behind me or 8 ahead, it'll make little difference in my reply time.\n\nAs for my preferences. I prefer first person narrative and an example of the style that I like and prefer:\n\n\"I just don't understand how you can say that\", I say with a quiver in my voice. I am in disbelief and I just don't understand because this is what you wanted. \n\nTo continue, it's an absolute must to me that the person either be a native English speaker, like myself or fluent in English. I'm not too strict to the length of the paragraph rule but 3+ lines are preferred. Somethings I don't like are the use of text slang, emojis and abbreviations (unless it's for companies and such). I need someone whom also keeps well track of setting, timeline and details. Speaking of details, I also want someone that's detail oriented and descriptive. Something that I prefer not to do but would be okay if the other person prefers it is using real places as settings. I feel it's more fun to create your own places (cities/towns, counties etc).\n\n\nNow, the plots. I have 3 in mind but the first two are ones I've never role-played before and the third I have. I prefer open plots so one can build around it as we go.\n\nPlot one - apocalypse rp. The government has ceased to exist much to their dismay. A virus outbreak has caused a collapse of a life we once lived. Surprisingly, the cause of the apocalypse isn't due to a lack of control of the virus spreading but instead, the delirium that broke down the sanity of those infected. The government planned it in order to terrify the nation but it quickly took a turn for the worst. The virus spread like a wildfire and seemed like it was out of control, yet it actually was exactly what the government wanted however, when they went to the next part of their plan, it failed and instead backfired. It took all but 6 months for the government to crumble and now, with no law, no rules and no control, it's up to us to survive.\n\nPlot two - undercover agents. An email pops up in our inboxes, one that is rather strange. Upon opening the email, even though one should know better, it reveals an invitation to an exclusive recruitment seminar. Most that were invited, show up, including us. We are all random people selected by the goverment to participate in a program (meaning that we don't know each other). A program that'll mold us to be undercover agents to spy on their own peers. We're stripped from the identity we've had been building on our whole lives and essentially become shape shifters, shifting between identities and change of appearances that were nothing but false and temporary. The secrets we uncover during the training program and the undercover program shows us a side of those who sit at the chairs of our country that we could never imagine existed. Will we ever be free of the program or we locked in something that poses to be a death sentence?\n\nPlot three - internet friends with a twist. We met on the internet just a few months before the day I flew to your city on the other side of the country. We spent a lot of time talking online however we have secrets that we've been keeping from one another. What seems to be an otherwise, normal meet up and visit takes a big turn once we discover that we're part of rival underground organisations. \n\nIf you've made it this far, thank you and if you're interested, pop me a message. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nHave a good one!",

            "selftext": " Today, I'd like to advertise something that has been five years in the works- a fantasy universe I have spent countless hours building and developing; taking inspiration from medieval fantasy linchpins such as Lord of the Rings, The Elder Scrolls, and the Witcher- whilst also building lore which is amazingly unique and like no other. There is a lot to learn, but I'm looking for more than a writing partner, but someone who will also adopt this intricate, carefully crafted world as their own, as we develop new lore together. I find it difficult to put into words how excited I am to finally put this out there after years making it- anyway, enough of my babbling, and down to the details. I am advanced literate to novella. I would personally say the length of my replies and the detail I put into it easily hits novella the vast majority of the time, and I'm looking for my partner to share this same writing style. Also, you should be able to play multiple characters, as the story will slowly and steadily gain more and more permanent characters who we shall both play and discover. Your character is up to you, though it may be wise to enquire to me about the existing races in my lore so you can see what is up for grabs. You will of course be able to design her as you please. Any characters you would like to introduce later will be entirely up to you. Directly below will be a rather lengthy plot which will introduce you to the world/universe and how the story will start off; I anticipate you having many questions, and I can answer every single one, so don't be afraid- how many does not matter.\n\nPlot:\n\nTime is measured in Ages- an Age ends with a world-changing event: war, a great catastrophe, a deity's ire... Time itself hangs in the balance of devastation, and no one knows when it will come, and a new Age will start anew. The date is 275 years into the Sixth Age, and the world is completely unaware the final hours of the Sixth Age is coming to an end... as well as many lives.\n\nThe gargantuan continent of Empirilis is ruled by the robust 'Empire'- which consists of every race upon Empirilis coming together in a democratic alliance that rules equally. Nearly encompassing the west of Empirilis is the gigantic country of Skorpain, renowned for its cunning Pharaohs, scorching deserts and awe-inspiring pyramids. 275 years in the past, the Kingdom of Skorpian was enveloped in a long and difficult civil war, as the North and South of this province quarreled about who was to be their next Pharaoh, as their last ruler had just perished without an heir. The Empire tried to intervene with their massive standing army- the Imperial Legion, but which side to back eluded them. the South won, and charged to hunt anybody who would call themselves 'Northeners'. The Empire prevented this by banishing the Skorpanian Northeners from Empirilis, and to an uncharted archipelago which would become known as the Isles of Hias. As the denizens of the Empire forgot about the ostracized Northerners, the same could not be said for the banished. They named themselves the 'Hiasians', and would build their strength for over two hundred years; using their hatred as a tool to train armies washed over with anti-Imperial propoganda. They were ready... no longer wanting to take back Skorpain, but annex the entire continent of Empirilis. The Emperor, Gallus Ionik had recently been married with a grand and exquisite wedding, to the beautiful new Empress, Eva Ionik. The Hiasians had hired an assassin to grow close to the Emperor over a couple years, to where she would assassinate him on their wedding night. With Empirilis now without an Emperor, and the assassin Eva planting disarray and panic into the Empire, the Hiasians launched an invasion a few billion men strong. Every monarch of every province and kingdom was removed to ensure utter weakness... communication upon Empirilis is a mess, with countries unaware who still stands against the Hiasian invasion. The vast Kingdom of Alraith consists of a talented and gentle people- possessing cat ears, eyes, and tails, with an appearance mirroring a human except for their feline additions. With Alraith being one of the most loyal Imperial provinces, the Hiasians begin there; descending upon the Alraithian Royal Palace and instigating an assault, and burning the beautiful building down to ensure no survivors.. leaving a smouldering palace, slain monarchs and glassy-eyed hand-maidens laying in the dirt. Alraith is without a leader, and the kingdoms and provinces of the Empire are soon to follow. A wounded Imperial soldier sights the smoke from a mile away, and rushes to help, only to find no one left but YOU- were you at this palace, did you see the smoke as well? Either way, paths collide... Together, the two plot to reclaim all they have lost, under a new regime that strengthens by the day- Hiasians rule with an iron fist, howls echo from lands beyond Empirilis, and primordial evil awakes to the smell of iron-smelling air.\n\nThe journey begins now, in the Day of Daggers.\n\nI do hope you liked my extremely length prompt!

And want someone who will send a couple sentences to a paragraph or so each time. A partner who puts in a little effort with ideas and things is a big bonus as well, I don\u2019t want to feel like I\u2019m doing all the work\nI write on discord which can be discussed once we have chatted and figured something out! \n\nI have two SOL plots written out and then two plots involving a more olden time royal theme.

I'd like this to be long-term with drama, action, romance, and of course the non pg stuff. I don't have any requirements other then please use proper grammar.

The United Kingdom has been invaded and trying to defend themselves, calling out for help. The United States hears their cry and goes to help.

            "selftext": "Hello there, I'm Aya, looking for a roleplay partner or two. :)\n\nI've been roleplaying quite a few years, terms have changed since I started, so I'm not sure I'd be able to even use them accurately, haha. I'll try to give a general picture:\n\n\\-I am definitely 18+, and would heavily prefer my partner be as well, please.\n\n\\-I like to play multiple main characters (2-3, maybe more if a roleplay goes on a long time) and many side characters, and hope my partner likes to at least play two main characters, themselves.\n\n\\-While I may miss a day now and then (usually with an apology), I'm usually able to reply several times a day once a roleplay starts going. I'd prefer someone who also tends to reply relatively often.\n\n\\-Though my intros can be very long (establishing the world, describing the character, etc.), my usually posts are 1-2 paragraphs, and I'd love someone who matches that.\n\n\\-Third person, past tense. I'm afraid anything else throws me off quite a bit. Also -- proper grammar, please. Typos of course happen, especially if you're typing back and forth quickly -- but please use commas, capitals, quotes, and apostrophes when writing a post?\n\n\\-I don't mind -- and even enjoy -- romance, but I like it as something that develops rather than the main point of the roleplay. I prefer an overarching, more action-based plot.\n\n\\-Most of my characters are straight (I play male and female, but also have some who are not in those categories), but I have several that are not. If you'd like to request I use one of those characters for the chance of a romance you'd be more interested in, please ask. But I do ask it not turn into a roleplay where straight people don't exist? (Mostly because I've noticed roleplays where that is the theme tend to be problematic in...other, surprisingly-consistent ways, to the point where it's become a red flag for me.)\n\n\\-Love fantasy and action/adventure. Not a fan of simple Slice of life/modern, I'm sorry.\n\n\\-If the roleplay is based on a fandom, I usually do not roleplay canons and prefer my partner doesn't, either. (My only exceptions to this are Marauder's Era and Future Era Harry Potter.)\n\n\\-Discord or e-mail would be my preferences, with Discord being my favorite by a decent margin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf all that sounds decent to you, the genres I'm most interested in the moment are:\n\n\\-Modern/Fantasy: Anything from a superhero universe to a modern-time D&amp;D-like universe to a \"monsters hide among humans and only some human know\" universe to a \"modern demigods stuck in a world-ending plot a la Rick Riordon\" universe setting. I have basic plots for basically all of these, and could probably come up with ideas if you have something you're looking for, or would love to hear your ideas. :)\n\n\\-Medieval/Fantasy: Something more along the times of a classic D&amp;D-like/Tolkien-like universe. Or even something more Avatar: The Last Airbender inspired, instead.\n\n\\-But feel free to ask, as well. I may not be able to do a fandom I'm completely unaware of, but since I don't really play canons in general, if you're alright with OCs and you have a fun plot, I may be able to adapt?\n\nIf any of that sounds interesting, please drop me a message here on Reddit and we can talk through it. :) Hope to hear from you.  \n\n\nEdit: If you have issues messaging me, let me know here, please! I have it set to anyone able message me, but it seems to maybe not work?",

            "selftext": "Anyone up for some Dead by Daylight with OCs? I'd like to play a female survivor against a male character, either survivor or killer.\n\nI'd prefer something plotty, though please be aware that I've only started playing the game this week so there's a lot of lore that I don't know. That being said, I'm open to hearing any plot ideas you might have and I can pull up the wiki to fill myself in if it's relevant. \n\nA few vague ideas I have are new survivor/seasoned survivor, two survivors who knew each other before and are slowly remembering their relationship (could have been enemies, lovers, friends etc, the juicier the better!), a killer taking a particular interest in a survivor (could also go down the route that they knew each other before, too), soulmate bonds between two survivors or a survivor and killer. Open to combining some of the ideas here too, and would love to hear any ideas you have.\n\nLooking for multi-paragraph replies ideally, please no one-liners. As long as you give me something to move the plot along and to reply to, I'll be happy.\n\nAll parters must be over 18, please. Character-wise, I'd prefer them to be 25+. \n\nPlease don't come expecting pure NSFW. \n\nWhen you message me, please include a little bit about what you're looking for and how old you are. If plotting with you is like pulling teeth, I'll lose interest very quickly and most likely block you. \n\nAlso please be aware that I'm going to be starting a new job next week so I may not be around very much while I adjust. \n\nThanks!",

            "selftext": "Hi - I'd like to play around in a world in which magic is outlawed. All magic. Medium-fantasy kind of terrain; people who use magic, if they are found, are arrested, imprisoned, and sometimes killed, sometimes exiled. \n\nMy character was born with magic and born to rich parents, who disowned her when she started displaying signs of magic. She's now a rogue trying to make her living, but sometimes has to use magic to survive, or can't control it; she's always on the run. The king's guards have the ability to sense out magic, but it's not always perfect; they themselves use mages they've conscripted for this service. Sometimes the mages lie to protect other magic-users, but it's at great risk to themselves, so you can't count on it.\n\nYour character can play anyone in this world. You could be:\n\n - a fellow magic user on the run, and we take up together\n - one of the mages forced to serve the king by hunting others. Maybe you find me and like me - or maybe we were childhood friends - and in finding me you're forced to make a terrible choice. Maybe you start to hide me so the others don't find me.\n - the king himself, maybe I'm brought before you and you can conscript me to your service, or force me into some other magic service; my other choice is death. \n - another member of the royal family/royal guard\n\nThose are my ideas. Would love to chat and build this world together. Message me! &lt;3 \n(please send a regular PM and not a chat, reddit chat drives me a little nuts, lol. I RP on here and on Discord.)",

            "selftext": "Hello! I have been roleplaying for a couple of years now, i'm a twenty-one years old person from Europe. I'm not a native English speaker so sometimes i make some mistakes, i'm trying to keep them at the minium. I'm looking for a partner in crime to create a romantic story, i don't mind males, females or anything in between.\n\nMy writing style: I usually use the third person and past tense, my replies are usually 100-300 words but they can be longer. I always try to keep my writing as detailed as possible.\n\nAbout the roleplay: It can be medieval, steampunk, modern, historical, futuristic. I won't play fandoms, i'm not a huge fan of them. I prefer to create with my partner our world and characters.\n\n---\n\nThese are a couple of my ideas with an introduction. \n\n**[Medieval] Stolen heart**\n\nThis scenario is about a thief and a princess, they meet in her chamber when he was trying to stole her jewelry. This story could be everywhere, it is up to us. We can even make the princess a prince and the thief a woman.\n\nIntroduction:\n\nThe cold wind of winter was blowing inside one of the castle's chamber pushing some papers on the floor, the sound of someone walking on the marble floor was slightly audible. The thief was searching in every drawer, the bag was full of jewels but he wanted more, he wanted to stole everything he could. The dinner usually lasted for one entire hours so he had time... at least it was what he thought. The ebony door suddenly was opened, his emerald eyes searched for a way out but he was too far away from the window. He had to quickly make a decision. When the door was closed he rushed towards the person who just entered in the room and he pinned their body on the wall, his hand was over their mouth. His eyes widened, she was the princess/prince.\n\n**[Modern] The newcomer**\n\nThis scenario is set in a highschool or college, the story begin in the second semester when my character goes for the first time in his new school. Your character could be a student or a teacher or whatever you want. \n\n\n**[Anything] Bring your own idea!**\n\n---\n\nPlease send me a PM if you are interested in roleplaying with me. Send me a little description of you and in what types of scenarios are you interested. Have a nice day.",

I am looking for male partners, my age or older, and if you're descriptive, literate and fun, we can build something amazing together. It would be nice to find someone in my time zone or close, it being CEST, but I can play with anyone really. Oh, and I don't like roleplaying with younger guys. Sorry.\n\n I've been roleplaying since I was 16, and I really like to write. My fave genres are fantasy, romance, drama, mystery and slice of life. I roleplay on Discord ONLY. I have a few ideas for this roleplay, but I also like making something new and fun with my partners. My fave characters to play are a modern day witch, vampire's prey, detective and a princess. I like lots of stuff, so we will probably have something we both like. Also, I don't really like fandom roleplays, and I WILL NOT send you any pictures of myself. \n\nIf you think we'd be a good match, please send me a message! I might get a lot of messages, and I will probably reply only to those I liked, so sorry if I don't reply to you, and please do not spam me. Thanks for understanding, and have a nice day.",

Just as long as I can understand what your writing. I want some who will be active. I'm not saying reply several times daily, but a least every couple of days.\n\nI want to do a pre-established world roleplay. For example: skyrim, fallout, cyberpunk, witcher, dragon age or mass effect. We can discuss which of these you might want to possibly do. I'm not looking to roleplay any game characters. It'll be our orginal characters in a pre-established world. \n\nI also have an original idea that I really want to try. Elven princess being arranged married to an orc queen. If your interested I'll give some details. \n\nI downloaded discord to use to roleplay. I'm still a little new to it so I may not know how to use certain features. I'm not looking to roleplay any other way. Discord is just easier for me. I'm looking for serious inquiries. Don't be up for it and then just ghost me please.",

Kings and Queen\u2019s rule vast lands. The people were separated by class, each having their struggles. It was the beginning of humanity. Rules were still being established, people were finding new things every day. The sky wasn\u2019t filled with fog or skyscrapers. Plants thrived and animals were plentiful. It was a time where things were peaceful...\n\n\ud835\ude74\ud835\udea1\ud835\ude8c\ud835\ude8e\ud835\ude99\ud835\ude9d \ud835\ude86\ud835\ude91\ud835\ude8a\ud835\ude9d \ud835\ude7b\ud835\ude9e\ud835\ude9b\ud835\ude94\ud835\ude8e\ud835\ude8d \ud835\ude78\ud835\ude97 \ud835\ude83\ud835\ude91\ud835\ude8e \ud835\ude73\ud835\ude8a\ud835\ude9b\ud835\ude94. \n\nThe man had been cursed from a young age, taught to do evil from the start. He, of course, wasn\u2019t human, the farthest thing from it. He was feared by many because of his thirst for human blood. His cravings made him go crazy, causing his outbursts, murders, and much more. It had gotten so bad he had killed the current king of [Insert Your Kingdom] and his young Queen. From there he took over as their new King. Causing many wars for land, in the end, he had won. This man had made an empire, one that may never be defeated. \n\n\ud835\ude71\ud835\ude9e\ud835\ude9d, \ud835\ude86\ud835\ude91\ud835\ude8a\ud835\ude9d \ud835\ude83\ud835\ude91\ud835\ude8e \ud835\ude7c\ud835\ude8a\ud835\ude97 \ud835\ude86\ud835\ude8a\ud835\ude9c\ud835\ude97'\ud835\ude9d \ud835\ude74\ud835\udea1\ud835\ude99\ud835\ude8e\ud835\ude8c\ud835\ude9d\ud835\ude92\ud835\ude97\ud835\ude90...\ud835\ude86\ud835\ude8a\ud835\ude9c \ud835\ude83\ud835\ude98 \ud835\ude77\ud835\ude8a\ud835\ude9f\ud835\ude8e \ud835\ude77\ud835\ude92\ud835\ude9c \ud835\ude77\ud835\ude8e\ud835\ude8a\ud835\ude9b\ud835\ude9d \ud835\ude82\ud835\ude9d\ud835\ude98\ud835\ude95\ud835\ude8e\ud835\ude97 \ud835\ude71\ud835\udea2 \ud835\ude70 \ud835\ude86\ud835\ude98\ud835\ude96\ud835\ude8a\ud835\ude97.\n\nHe was going his usual day, causing fear in the hearts of his people. When someone bumped into him. The sound of glass shattering filled the air causing those around to turn their attention to the two. He didn\u2019t bother turning, just glanced over his shoulder. The woman had long, sandy hair with a pair of ocean blue eyes. She had been carrying bottles of wine. The woman apologized numerous times. Before she could again he grabbed her chin and pulled her face up so it was inches from his own. He studied her face, his expression unreadable. His eyes were mixed with curiosity and a slight bit of excitement. \n\n\ud835\ude83\ud835\ude91\ud835\ude92\ud835\ude9c \ud835\ude86\ud835\ude8a\ud835\ude9c \ud835\ude76\ud835\ude98\ud835\ude92\ud835\ude97\ud835\ude90 \ud835\ude83\ud835\ude98 \ud835\ude77\ud835\ude9e\ud835\ude9b\ud835\ude9d.\n\nThe two seemed to be drawn to one another. The Vampire King would start making more trips into town. Not to threaten the people, but to see her. He wasn't able to understand the feeling he got when he was around her. It was driving him up a wall. \nThe more time he spent with her the stronger this feeling became. Finally, he had invited the woman to his castle. Following her as she explored every room. The way her eyes lit up at the luxurious items around every corner. As he watched her he became aware of the feeling that had taken over. As they arrived at his chambers he closed the door. He gazed at the woman as she looked out the large window. Moving behind her he placed one hand on her hip, the other went to her chin. Turning her head so their lips were mere centimeters apart. He muttered one word that would change both their lives. \n\n\u201c\ud835\ude7c\ud835\ude92\ud835\ude97\ud835\ude8e...\"\n\nThe lovers grew close over the next year. Spending almost every second of every day together. And when the Vampire King had to leave his love for other [War business/Kingdom matters/ whatever else you think of] he promised he would only be gone for the day wanting to return to her before she went to sleep. And so the trip came and went, the sun slipped under the horizon and he returned to his kingdom. Walking through the torchlit halls, he stopped before walking into their room. The door was open...and the air smelled of blood. Rushing inside he stopped at the sight in front of him. \nThe woman laid on the bed, a pool of blood surrounded her body. Staining her gown, hair, and skin. The Vampire King rushed over to his Queen, holding her lifeless body in his arms. \n\n\ud835\ude83\ud835\ude91\ud835\ude8a\ud835\ude9d \ud835\ude7d\ud835\ude92\ud835\ude90\ud835\ude91\ud835\ude9d \ud835\ude83\ud835\ude91\ud835\ude8e \ud835\ude86\ud835\ude91\ud835\ude98\ud835\ude95\ud835\ude8e \ud835\ude7a\ud835\ude92\ud835\ude97\ud835\ude90\ud835\ude8d\ud835\ude98\ud835\ude96 \ud835\ude72\ud835\ude98\ud835\ude9e\ud835\ude95\ud835\ude8d \ud835\ude77\ud835\ude8e\ud835\ude8a\ud835\ude9b \ud835\ude77\ud835\ude92\ud835\ude9c \ud835\ude82\ud835\ude8c\ud835\ude9b\ud835\ude8e\ud835\ude8a\ud835\ude96.\n\nThat Woman had changed the King in many ways. She helped him tame his thirst, stopped many of his murder sprees, and made him better overall...at least when she was around him. \nNow that she was gone his emotions went overboard. He wanted to find who did this to his love, but never did he find them. From there rules became tight, his army increased in size, and he stopped himself from loving again. The thing he hated the most having taken over his being since her death. \n\n\ud835\ude7f\ud835\ude8a\ud835\ude92\ud835\ude97\n\nA hundred years passed since the death of his queen. It was the annual Winter Ball. Guests came from all over to attend this event. It lasted from early in the morning till midnight. Food and wine was served. Both humans and vampires attended. \n\n\ud835\ude78\ud835\ude9d \ud835\ude86\ud835\ude8a\ud835\ude9c \ud835\ude7b\ud835\ude92\ud835\ude94\ud835\ude8e \ud835\ude70\ud835\ude97\ud835\udea2 \ud835\ude7e\ud835\ude9d\ud835\ude91\ud835\ude8e\ud835\ude9b \ud835\ude71\ud835\ude8a\ud835\ude95\ud835\ude95 \ud835\ude77\ud835\ude8e \ud835\ude77\ud835\ude8a\ud835\ude8d \ud835\ude83\ud835\ude91\ud835\ude9b\ud835\ude98\ud835\udea0\ud835\ude97. \n\nThe Vampire King sat on his throne spectating. He remembered a time when he used to go out there and join in the dancing, but now he only left his throne to greet his companions. \nIt was later in the evening, the sun was slowly starting to disappear. Yet the party was still as lively as ever. The King stood by two other vampires. They were talking away about things that have happened. He glanced around the room growing bored of the ball. Just as he was about to return to his conversation a sweet smell filled his nose. This grabbed his interest so he looked around trying to pinpoint where the smell was coming from. His eyes moved to the grand entrance and noticed a woman walking in. She had long, brown hair and bright emerald green eyes. She was lower class, anyone could tell that from the way she was dressed. A mask covered her eyes shielding her identity like every other person at the ball. And before the king could even think, one word he never knew he would say again escaped his lips. \n\n\"\ud835\ude7c\ud835\ude92\ud835\ude97\ud835\ude8e.\"\n\nRULES:\n-Be DETAILED, I want PARAGRAPHS please!

            "selftext": "Howdy! I'm Mast \u2013 21, any pronouns. I've been roleplaying for a decade now, although a decent chunk of that time was spent writing dimensionless, overpowered characters on the Neopets boards, so take that as you will. The important thing is that I am no longer a 12 year old with a penchant for needlessly dramatic roleplays. I am now a 21 year old with a penchant for needlessly dramatic roleplays, and also my grammar is much gooder.\n\nIn the interest of not wasting any more of your time, let's get to the important stuff!\n\nI'm looking to write *Discovery*'s favorite medical officer, Hugh Culber, against any canon Star Trek character of your choosing. When I say any, I do mean any. I'd adore Stamets and either of the Tal kids most of all, but I have a special place in my heart for those rare interactions Culber has with the rest of the crew. Or, if you want to mix and match series/timelines, I am more on board than you could ever know.\n\nWhen it comes to plots and genres, I'm open! We can throw our characters into canon-typical nonstop dire stakes, take a break with some casual exploration and world building, do a one-off away mission or counseling session, anything. If you have an AU you've been craving \u2013 whether it's a parallel universe that exists one step to the left of canon or it has nothing to do with DISCO except for the characters involved \u2013 I'm in.\n\nIf you're willing to indulge me, I would sacrifice both my pinky toes for a chance to do something with the mirror universe. Mirror Culber is a fascinating-horrible dude and I'd love to examine him under a microscope. Prime Culber interacting with a mirror character/the mirror verse is a beautiful concept as well. Any configuration of prime/mirror characters in the prime/mirror verse is a-okay by me (and if you want, I could play both prime and mirror versions of Culber if you're willing to play two characters/versions of someone else). I am very passionate about over-the-top war criminals in dramatic eyeliner and shiny armor. I just think they're neat.\n\nWith regards to romance, Culber/Stamets is popular for good and obvious reasons. Love them. Bring it on in. If you have a rarepair in mind involving Culber, tell me all about it! We can find a way to work it in. Just be warned, I'll only ship Culber with adult male/masc-aligned/nb people. Big points for Saru, Rhys, or Lorca (if we're doing a full-on mirror verse). Romance is 100% optional no matter what, though. Let me know what you're feeling.\n\nA few OOC details \u2013 please skim these to make sure we're compatible:\n\n* Please be 18+\n* Response time is anything from a couple times per week to a couple times per month (Doesn't matter if you take one day to a year to reply, I love you.)\n* 2-5 paragraphs per reply is my sweet spot (No one-liners, period.)\n* Replies will be in 3rd person\n* Mainly looking to do Discord or Docs\n* If you are somewhat interested in this but not sure I can string a comprehensible sentence together (fair), PM me and I can shoot you a writing sample",

            "selftext": "\n\nI\u2019ve had this idea for a roleplay for a while now, and I\u2019m hoping to find a willing partner or two to join me. The basic idea is a world where all war is fought by those who can shift into animals. They are called \u2018Spritures\u2019 and they are the only soldiers a king or leader can have. There\u2019s a hierarchy as too how strong they are. \nWolves are the most common and weakest. Yet they also have a power ranking system.\nFrom weakest to strongest it is \nGrey wolf,\nRed wolf,\nBronze wolf,\nCopper wolf,\nBlack wolf,\nWhite wolf.\nThen is the big cats\nFrom weakest to strongest \nLynx\nCheetah,\nLeopard (snow or regular),\nPanther,\nLion.\nAs the animals get stronger they also get rarer. The ultimate hope is for a king to get the one that can change into a shimmering sapphire dragon. That only comes around once every 1000 years. And the dragon has already happened in this roleplay, so that animal is off the table. Feel free to add your own animals if you want! All i ask is you keep it to mammals and predators only. Though if given a good enough reason i can allow prey animals as well. If this is confusing, I can explain it easier 1x1. If this sounds interesting please send me a message through reddit. Have the subject be what animal you\u2019re character would want to change into. That\u2019s just so I can tell who read this far! Hope this sparks someone\u2019s interest!",

            "selftext": "Happy Summer! My names Elliot, I\u2019m an /almost/ 20 year old, and have far too much free time on my hands at the moment so I\u2019m hoping to start a few more role plays. \n\nUsually I\u2019m in the Seattle so I\u2019m on PST time though I don\u2019t really mind what time zone your in. I try to get out at least one reply every day but that doesn\u2019t always happen. My moods can change really quickly so sometimes it might take a long time, but I try to make sure it goes no longer than a week or so. But because of that I have no real expectations for you and how long you take too reply, though if it\u2019s a few weeks or something then obviously I\u2019ll give you a poke and vice versa  obviously.\n\nAt the very least I try to reply with a paragraph but I can easily write more depending on what there is to work with. I don\u2019t expect you too always or even on a semi-regular basis write novels or anything but one liners suck so at least a paragraph from you would be cool. And along with that, I tend to write in third person past tense but I can also write present tense if needed. Just let me know which you prefer.\n\nI only do clean roleplays cause not doing them makes me *extremely* uncomfortable, though I\u2019m totally fine with alluding to it or fading to black or whatever else. I\u2019ll happily dive darker topics though, and prefer too actually. Angst is my jam and I like putting my characters through stuff. So as long as it\u2019s discussed beforehand, I\u2019m all for it.\n\nFace claims are cool if you use them and it\u2019s totally fine if you don\u2019t, along with pretty much artsy stuff (collages, playlist, other stuff). Basically it\u2019s fun and sometimes I do it but also if it\u2019s not your thing that is totally fine.\n\nWith that being said, here\u2019s some of the ideas I have:\n\n\u2014&gt;  Something to do with fame and/or Hollywood hopefully. Whether it\u2019s musicians, actors, reality tv stars, high profile billionaires or whatever else, I just think it would be really fun to explore that world and possible dynamics. I have some general ideas of plots and a character that could fit but nothing is set in stone yet\n\n\u2014&gt; I\u2019ve been craving something to do set in high school. I\u2019m leaning towards somewhat stereotypical roles (nerd x jock, bad boy or girl x popular kid, other stuff like that). Just basically nothing super crazy out of place in a school. I\u2019m hoping to just focus on our characters and their relationship more than anything. And by extension make sure that we aren\u2019t just making base level Mary or Gary Sue\u2019s. But that\u2019s as much as I\u2019ve figured out so it\u2019s still super open.\n\n\u2014&gt; This one is super up in the air, but a while ago I watched Demon Slayer and kind of fell in love with the show and immediately made an oc who I\u2019m curious to play as. I\u2019m hoping to stick to original characters just because I don\u2019t think I could role play as the canon characters for too long. I still wanna follow the timeline of the show but with our characters going through different events. It\u2019ll be new for me cause I haven\u2019t done much action focused roleplays, but if you have patience it could be fun. Also, the oc is a minor so just keep that in mind.\n\n\u2014&gt; Last one, and the most vague is barely an idea. But I love cities so I\u2019d love to do something set in one. Two characters in a massive space with millions of people that meet despite all odds and just kinda go from there. It\u2019s very open so we could do pretty much anything, preferably more in the slice of life side of things or at least primarily, but beyond that I\u2019m super open.\n\n\nThis got kinda long but I appreciate you for reading this if you did! I can roleplay on Kik or Discord but have a preference for Discord. Also I dig a good slow-burn romance so please keep that in mind.

Also im kinda sad because of  roleplay of this kind i really enjoyed just ended...anyway! The plot is  simple, a Vampire meets another person (prefferably non-vampire) and  they fall in love. Of course not instantly, i prefer it more slow burn.  About a specific plot can be talked later, i got some ideas. I can do  mutiple paras or one-line, whatever the roleplay requires. Also im not a  huge fan of drama but some is okay, makes it a bit more exciting. For  any questions please just open a chat, theres a good chance im going to  see comments or DMs way, way later than chats. I mainly roleplay on  discord but if you only have reddit thats cool too.  \n\n\nAlso if your getting bored or don\u00b4t feel like doing the roleplay anymore please, please just tell me. It makes me feel really bad if people either gosht or block me....",

I'm glad you could have stumbled across my post here on r/Roleplay, I have a very specific request in mind that I hope someone would enjoy to fill, but, if you have something similar to this request that you'd like to do, or some other compelling idea, you may also propose it.  \n\nA little about me, I'm twenty years of age, I'd say that I'm very detailed when it comes to RPing, I prefer first person, but I can do third person if need be.  I enjoy to add meaningful detail to the roleplay, adding as much as required, or as little, depending on the circumstances.  It can be as little as a few sentences, or as long as many paragraphs, it all depends.  \n\nI had the idea of roleplaying out a, say, relationship, a family relationship, that is, between a brother, and a sister.  This is not a NSFW relationship, this is a wholesome, real, and developing relationship.  A potiental plot line could be started by the marriage of a man and a woman, which then causes my character and yours to become brother and sister, stepbrother and stepsister.  Would could also do a more organic brother and sister RP, from that perspective.  It depends on what we both wanna do.\n\nIf this idea appeals to do, or you have something similar in mind, or another compelling idea, drop me a PM, or a reply, I will get back to you.  Hope to see you soon!  :)",

I\u2019ve been incredibly busy, unable to do rp for a little while and that has meant I\u2019ve had plenty of fleeting moments to imagine what I could do if I had time. What little spare time I\u2019ve had has been spent rewatching Samurai Champloo. Throughout doing this I\u2019ve been having many ideas, inspirations and such and finally have managed to craft an original setting with many original characters populating it. There\u2019s many storylines that could be explored, many characters to meet, many things to do...all my world is missing is a protagonist to venture through it! And that\u2019s where you come in!\n\n\nThe setting is very similar to the show\u2019s setting, no futuristic laser beams or ridiculous stuff! Good old sword on sword combat...unless you don\u2019t use a sword. Normally I\u2019d ask you to make your oc before you message me but for this setting I\u2019ve planned out a lot of the world, so preferably I\u2019d send that information to you then you could use it to adapt an existing oc into it or create an oc based off the setting description! Simply message me and provide a summary of what drew you to my prompt, your age, your time zone, discord tag and your best knock knock joke! I\u2019m hoping we don\u2019t just have a strictly rp relationship, a little chatting could be fun too! Once I have all that I\u2019ll send you the world info and you can build a character based off that! Plenty of information on regions, cultures and such for you to take into account!\n\n\nI tend to write in 1-2 decently long paragraphs! Some part of the rp will be full of action, Some full of comedy, some full of drama! Even romance if you want! Theres plenty to take care of! I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be able to ! I hope to hear from ya\u2019ll! Please no super boring edgy ocs please!  No sons of demons or people with blades made of shadows. If we have rped before I\u2019ll happily still talk! Things have been a little hard for me but I\u2019m much more available now I pinky promise! Things can really get rolling! I tend to rp on other platforms, so if you have any do let me know as it\u2019s easier to organise things if they aren\u2019t simply in reddit dms. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll find one, I have most major ones!\nHope to hear from you all soon!",

            "selftext": " \n\nHi there! Thanks for taking a look at my advertisement!\n\nMy name's Kyle, I'm 21, English and I'm currently looking for some RP partners to write some cool and original stories! Before I say about what I like to roleplay, allow me to introduce myself and my likes.\n\n\u2022 I'm currently 21, so I'm looking for someone 18+. Simple enough reasoning.\n\n\u2022 I'm currently only looking for female RP Partners playing a female OC. I do apologize if this doesn't include you. It's just my personal preference.\n\n\u2022 I, please, ask that anyone who RPs with me is somewhat frequent. A post a day is just something that just isn't entertaining to me and my interest will quickly drop. If you're going to be too busy or otherwise occupied on some days, please tell me.\n\n\u2022 I like a partner who's detailed and experienced. Fine, quickfire posts can be shorter, but I like quality in my posts. Also, I RP in THIRD person only. Again, just my preference. I also play OC Characters only as well. I don't find it entertaining to play a Canon Character. My secret word is Delta. Please use this in your message at some point so I know you're reading all of my posts.\n\n\u2022 Finally, I like people who are interested in the same things as myself. Please understand what my RP is being based on.\n\nRight! Now I have my expectations out of the way, here are the things I'm looking for to RP!\n\nThemes marked with **BOLD** are my preferred genres. This does not mean that you can't message me if you don't want to do a specific theme, you can message me about all of the genres below!\n\nNOTE: All my RPs include some essence of Romance subplot\n\n**\u2022 Real-Life Romance**\n\n**\u2022 Sci-Fi**\n\n**\u2022 Mecha**\n\n**\u2022 Halo**\n\n**\u2022 Destiny &lt;-- My Main Genre**\n\n**\u2022 Superhero \\[DC/Marvel/Invincible/OC-Verse\\] &lt;-- Currently looking for!**\n\n\u2022 Apocalypse \\[Zombie/Infected/Alien\\]\n\nI can safely say I will try my utmost hardest to respond to all chat requests and messages as soon as I possibly can, even if it's to say that we're not fit to be RP partners, although this depends on how many I do get. c:\n\nI hope you all enjoyed what I've produced and I hope that I get some responses fairly soon! Thanks again for taking the time to read my post! See you soon!",

A girl has grown up and been raised as a solider (my OC) for the government. But as time goes on she starts to have frequent breakdowns and starts becoming defiant. So a psychiatrist (your OC) is hired to talk to her and keep her in line and at the end of every session he is to give her medication of which he isn\u2019t Informed about. Slowly it is obvious she becomes more cooperative and loyal but at the cost of her memories. Your OC would try to get her out after starting to realize the horror she\u2019s been through despite her now being fully loyal and try to show her the world and get her memories back. That\u2019s all I have planned and I\u2019m not looking for NSFW!! Thanks and PM me if interested.",

            "selftext": "Heyo, lit nerds. I've been craving some rp lately and wandered if anyone was interested.\n\nA little about me, I'm 22, I've some decent RP experience, tho I wouldn't call myself aaster RPer. And that's what I'm looking for in a partner, too. A little experience and a willingness to improvise with response length.\n\nIm not looking for paragraphs or novelas, I'm looking for someone who'll be consistent in replying relatively quickly in a set time slot we agree on, real life takes priority obviously.\n\nPlease if you decide that this isn't for you mid RP do tell me, I won't mind, just don't ghost me.\n\nAnyways onto what I had in mind. I'll leave the setting open so we can work to build it up trough discussion and RP.\n\nIn the year 2015 the world was involved in its first bio-war. Weapons of mass destruction meant to turn the population of a country against itself, or just kill massive amounts of people in horrifying ways. Now six years later the horrors of the bio-war are coming back to remind us they never left. Abominations ransack City blocks, small communities go dark only to be found turned to mush or murderous cannibalistic cults lead by insane mutants with supernatural powers. We are the unfortunates of one such incident. (read modern Resident Evil-ish)\n\nWe can discuss how the story unfolds from there and what we want our characters to achieve. \n\nAs you can see this is a more horror setting so if you are not interested in that stuf it's OK to pass on this. While it is horror I'm very interested how the relationship between our characters develops under such stressful circumstances, so romance is appreciated but not expected.\n\nIf you do have a better twist on the setting I'm willing to listen and adapt. \n\nAnyways if you are interested PM me or start a chat or comment, so we can discuss platforms. I don't like Reddit chat or PMs but I can work around it if it's a complete no go.\n\nThanks for reading. Hope to hear from you.",

Of course I do have a few quick rules to go over before I get into the different plots I have been dying to try out so fair warning.\n\n  -Now that that\u2019s all said, let\u2019s pull over those first no one liners. I just find them hard to work with I adore having more room to write. Now I normally tend to do three to four paragraphs but that differs on my partner. I like to math their length as best I can. The second is no ghosting please do not message me if you plan to just dip after a week. Couple of days or even not even respond after the first message. It is very frustrating now. The third and final rule if one could even call it that lol. Is open communication I love to get to know my partners and hopefully even develop some kinda kinship!-\n\n  ~That\u2019s all I have to say for that, finally onto the kinds of plots I tend to do. I am a sucker for fantasy I don\u2019t know what it is about the setting it\u2019s just super fun to get lost in another world. Sometimes I do a mixture of the two, like romance plots. I can do adventure and horror but those are the ones I have normally done. I have been rpying for around three years now. And I stay on discord it\u2019s just far easier that way to work things out.~\n\n       Onto the plots! These are originals I only rp with ocs keep that in mind please and thank you:)\n\n\nThe first one surrounds bay, he happens to be a forest spirt. He is deeply connected with the woods and all of the creatures in them. Given that he has lived their for his entire life. And had to give his word he would protect the inhabitants with his very soul and being. He is a very cheerful person. Though he gets frightened easily by fire, and other hot things. This plot is surrounding him of course. Some humans greedy as they are found their way into the forest and burnt down the life tree killing nearly all the inhabitants. Somehow he managed to escape with one sapling left. He had been wandering the globe ever since trying to find the perfect place to find home.(There is more to this if you have an interest In this plot I\u2019ll be happy to tell more so you can get a better view of the story!)\n\n   \u2014onto the next\u2014\n\nLilith, she had spent her days down underneath the overworked serving their king. Going on missions and retrieving things for him. Taking down other empires she had been a spy for so many years. She has a very difficult time trusting others. Even leaving the palace walls had been an issue for her in the past given it was the only place she had ever felt any sense of safety.. the only being she keeps close is her lion. Who in fact can shift his size growing to giant heights normally he carries a house on his back. She spends her time traveling in it with her friend. Over the years she had been very skilled in the art of the blades she keeps two twin daggers on her sides at all times.\n\n\u2014Last\u2014\n\n  Lavender, he had been a guardian spirt for years thought even with his immense powers it wasn\u2019t like he could do much. Given he would have to have a human, or some other mortal have owner ship over his key. He had fought by the sides of mankind for centuries but here of late the only thing he had really been doing was resting in a cave. His last owner unfortunately perished there he couldn\u2019t leave not until someone picked up his locket. And brought him back to this plane of existence.\n\n-I have plenty more to choose from or we could even create one of our own but that\u2019s really up to whomever reads this I wish you all well! Have a great day now!^^",

            "selftext": "**Hi, hello, howdy, and greetings!**\n\nFirst things first \u2014 allow me to offer a bit of an introduction! The name is Reyes ( they / them or she / her ). I'm a twenty-something year old university student stuck in the CST timezone. I've been roleplaying for seven some odd years but, due to the chaotic unease that came with navigating college courses in the midst of a pandemic, withdrew from roleplaying over the past year. But, I've found more time on my hands as of late and a strong desire to get writing again, so . . . here I am!\n\nBefore I go any further, I'm going to detail a bit of what I'm looking for in a partner. That way you can figure out if we would be at all compatible, and if it seems we wouldn't you don't have to subject yourself to any more of my rambling!\n\n**I .** As I am in my twenties, I am exclusively seeking partners 18 years or older. Purely a comfort thing. Beyond that, I am willing and eager to write with just about anyone.\n\n**II .** I exclusively write in the third person, and prefer writing responses anywhere in length from multi-para to novella length. The latter I am more flexible on. If the scene calls for shorter responses, I'm totally flexible and willing to do rapid fire, single paragraphs. However I must insist on straying from one word / one sentence replies. It just isn't my style as I tend to be on the wordier, more descriptive side. That being said \u2014 *I can tend to be on the wordier, more descriptive side.* I'm seeking a partner with a similar writing style, but I *can* tend to go a bit overboard, so in instances in which I do, I do not expect length matching! Quality over quantity, you know? . . . Also \u2014 love using face claims for our characters! May even put a bit of my ( ongoing ) degree to use and draw them up at one point or another! \n\n**III .** I guess this is more of a ***IIb .*** than it's own point but, oh well. Going off of my last point, I am completely willing to play multiple characters ( npcs, secondary characters, etc. ) within our scenarios! It would be great if that was reciprocated, but I understand that isn't for everyone. However, if it becomes a situation of *I'm playing everyone in the universe that isn't your character* then I *might* say something. \n\n**IV .** I prefer my partner's be people who are comfortable talking ooc that way we can world build, plot plan, ~~gush about~~ discuss our ocs, and otherwise just chat! It's just more fun that way, in my opinion,\n\n**V .** I role-play on discord, as I prefer the interface. I *could* be open to other platforms, but we would have to discuss it. Otherwise, discord is my go to.\n\n**VI .** Communication and flexibility is so important to me! As a college student ( yes, it is summer break, but I am currently taking summer courses ) and a part time worker, sometimes life can get hectic and I don't have it in me to write a response. I try my best to get out at least one response a day, but in the event I don't, please understand it isn't you! I will always communicate anything that could keep me from responding, and would expect the same from you!\n\n***Phew!*** If you made it past that text wall, yay! I'm delighted to have you here. And if you didn't . . . *well, you probably aren't reading anymore* . . .\n\nMoving on :)\n\nAt this time I'm seeking partners to write and develop OC x OC content with. Under the right circumstances I could maybe, possibly be swayed to do OC x Canon and / or Canon x Canon content but that's something I'm more willing to explore with someone I've written with for a while. So, for now, just OC x OC please!\n\nI am comfortable completely comfortable portraying male, female, or gnc characters and will pair them with whatever character you'd like to portray. That is to say, I'm cool with FxF, MxM, FxM, MxF and any other pairings your heart may desire!\n\nContent wise, I'm open to discuss just about anything \u2014 if there's a particular scene or universe you've been dying to play in, hit me with it! Particularly, I'm fond of really *slooooow,* slow-burn romances, fantasy-adventure type stories, futuristic cyberpunk settings, and historical-esque kinda stories. If none of that suits your fancy, totally fine, we can always discuss something different! I will say, I'm not too fond of slice of life stuff unless it's like . . . not very slice of life-y. I'm more than willing to do things rooted in real life, just not a huge fan of the typical. I like things to be unique and dramatic!\n\nI don't have any particular scenes or starters in mind as I prefer discussing and molding scenarios to my partner's &amp; my own preferences. However, if you have anything in mind ( as I said ) I'm always willing to hear it out!\n\nWe can create our own universe to write in, or I'm comfortable sourcing existing media! There are quite a few fandoms I'm knowledgeable in and comfortable navigating. I'll list them below for your convenience!\n\n**I .** The Elder scrolls\n\n**II .** Dragon Age\n\n**III .** Mass Effect\n\n**IV .** Game of Thrones\n\n**V .** Fallout\n\n**VI .** The Last of US\n\n**VII .** The Forgotten Realms\n\n**VIII .** The MCU\n\nDefinitely forgetting some, so if there's a universe you'd like to write in, don't be afraid to throw it my way! If I know nothing about it, I may even be willing to read up on some lore so we can possibly explore it anyways!\n\nI've been rambling, so I'll wrap this up before it gets any longer than it already is. If any of this interests you, feel free to shoot me a message and tell me a bit about yourself &amp; why you think we'd make good partners! Then, we can move from there. Thank you so much for dealing with my blathering and I look forward to hearing from y'all!",

            "selftext": "Hi everyone! I currently have almost no RP's going on so I'm looking for a few more. Underneath are some of my ideas, but please do reach out if you have anything you want to try out that's not on the list.\n\nI'm a 16yo female writer with 5 years of experience in role-playing. I write literate and mostly write around 200-400 words, yet I seem to match the word count my partner uses. I live in the CET timezone but it doesn't matter to me if you're timezone is completely different. I only write 3rd person, past tense and I rather play female characters.\n\nUnderneath some storylines,\n\n**Criminal**   \n*Open for: Daughter of crimelord x crimelord's right hand, two spies on a mission, spy x target, etc.*   \n\\- This RP is really broad as I have not yet thought of a specific storyline. Yet I would love to have some RP where your character would be the bad boy, and my character the good girl (but maybe with a dark side?)\n\n**Harry Potter 1 (Tom Riddle)**  \n\\- This RP Takes place in the years that Tom Riddle attended Hogwarts. You'll be playing him and I'll play an OC who is sorted in Slytherin as well. Eager for knowledge, yet naive. Tom Riddle convinces my character he is in love with her, but the relationship is really toxic and he basically gets her to do anything for her. Turning her into a murderer, who craves his approval.\n\n**Harry Potter 2 (Seventh-year redo)**  \n*I'll play Hermione, Ginny or an OC. You can be anyone you want. I'm open for: OCxOC, HermionexDraco, etc.*  \n\\- It's the year 1999. The year after the battle of Hogwarts. Some students return to redo their seventh year, others don't. How will the new year affect them?\n\n**Princess x Peasant**\\-  \n*Also open to doing this the other way around (Prince x Peasant) !!*  \n\\- One a royal. One a peasant. They aren't allowed to date, so they do it in secret. Then the royal gets the news that there is a prince they must marry. Will they run away together? \n\n**Arranged marriage**  \n\\- A basic RP where both our characters will be royals. To unite their kingdoms they must marry. Will they fall in love? Or can they not stand each other? Or does the one think that he is so much better than the other? \n\n**Also looking for Atla, Tlok, and Percy Jackon RP's but I have not yet thought of any plots.  If you are interested in any of those, please state a plot in the dm you send me, I hate people agreeing to do something with me but then can't think of a plot, which causes the RP to never start.**  \n\n\n**Please DM me if you are interested in doing any of these with me !! (Or if you have ideas yourself).**",

I usually write in 1st person, present tense and anything between 1 to 2 paragraphs.\n\nI am looking for someone who will do a romantic RP with me. I would like for it to start in college but we would eventually develop our characters and have them go through life (marriege, kids, etc.). However, I have a specific type of male character I'm looking for. I want a romance that has a lot of drama and realistic settings. I want a male that is arrogant and cocky (preferably an athlete or even bad boy), possibly player that can be sweet but also very possessive. I want the relationship to have drama. They love each other very much, but there's always drama. I don't mind cheating, fighting, screaming, etc. at all.\n\nPlease let me know if you're interested!",

FANDOMS I am honestly looking for someone to do fandom roleplays. Supernatural, Riverdale, The chilling adventures of Sabrina The Teenage Witch, Greys Anatomy, Station 19, 911, YOU, Peaky Blinders, The Good Place, Umbrella Academy, criminal minds, Mighty Duck. Marvel, DC (no joker and Harley Quinn) Julie and the Phantoms. \n\nWriting Style/Length:\n\nI\u2019ll be honest, I  have a comprehending problem. My posts can range from 2 well size paragraphs to 1 . I will NOT do one sentence reply\u2019s. I would expect you to do the same.\n\n\nWriting Platform:\n\nI\u2019m open to reddit dm\u2019s, but we could do something else. Discord preferably it\u2019s easier to personalize and make it ours.\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n\n\u2022Be an adult. The roleplay will be sfw, I do NOT do NSFW I am happily taken and find it strange to engage in that. We would do a blackout.Age range of 19-32 would be best. \n\n\n\u2022Be willing to write multiple characters, I will do the same. \n\n\nFrequency:\n\nI understand being busy, I\u2019m busy a lot as well but let\u2019s communicate if you are going to be busy vise versa. \n\nThanks guys!",

Let me lay down some rules so I don't waste your time!\n\n\u00b0Rules - No anime face claims (personal preference), use Discord, be able to write at least more than two or three (I personally write at least a paragraph or two), and that is about all!\n\n\u00b0Personal Info - I am 18+ and wish for my partner to be as well but it is not a requirement (just know some things will be off limits), my literacy levels are literate to advanced literate depending on what my partner gives me, and my timezone is EST.\n\nNow I'll discuss some aspects of the world and roleplay itself! As the title states, the roleplay will be loosely based on Darkest Dungeon so expect a heavy rely on combat, stress, madness, gore, and other topics that usually don't sit right with most people so if you're not prepared for heavy subjects then...this may not be for you.\n\nBut!!! There is always light in darkness and some scenes will allow us to develop our characters and form a bond between the two. Such as sitting around a campfire and letting them talk to one another before facing extraterrestrial horrors that lie in the dark, waiting to strike.\n\nSpeaking of characters, I would advise bringing a second character into the mix because you never know what could happen. And I cannot stress this enough, characters will but that will be of your own decision, I will not choose for you!\n\nOther than that, I can't wait to see you in my dms!!!",

I consider myself advanced literate, but I\u2019ll match what my partner puts out into the roleplay. I find that when I\u2019m really interested in a roleplay, I can sometimes go double over the discord character limit, but I\u2019ll try not to overwhelm you! \n\n\n\n[\ud835\ude19\ud835\ude1c\ud835\ude13\ud835\ude0c\ud835\ude1a]\n\n-Please be over 18. Preferably 21+, but 18+ is okay. I just don\u2019t feel comfortable roleplaying with minors in any manner. \n-I would greatly appreciate if my partner could be at a literate level. Please, no one liners. Quality over quantity, but I would prefer at least 3 paragraphs with good grammar!\n-I only roleplay in 3rd person past tense! \n-My preferred platform for roleplaying is discord!! \n\n\n\n[\ud835\ude17\ud835\ude13\ud835\ude16\ud835\ude1b\ud835\ude1a \ud835\ude08\ud835\ude15\ud835\ude0b \ud835\ude0a\ud835\ude0f\ud835\ude08\ud835\ude19\ud835\ude08\ud835\ude0a\ud835\ude1b\ud835\ude0c\ud835\ude19\ud835\ude1a]\n\nI\u2019m looking for someone to play as Lord Karl Heisenberg against my OC. I\u2019m 100% okay with doubling, as I can also play Lady Alcina Dimitrescu against your OC as well! \nI would love to roleplay a romance-cantered plot, possible with some action mixed in!\nI prefer to discuss plotting with my partner so please message me if you have any ideas for plots! I do have a plot in mind that we can always work around as well! AUs are also acceptable if I\u2019m into it!

            "selftext": "Hi there! I'm Luffy and for a while now I've been posting ads that haven't seemed to be getting a lot of traction. So unlike my usual posts I'll try something different that I feel like I'd be interested in starting up.  \n\n\nI'd like to create a fantasy world with someone, something entirely new. One with a whole new set of world building, cast, and much much more. I'm into really any idea this world could be started off with, but I can give some general prompts of things I would be willing to try out. I'm up for ideas as well, but if one of these catches your eye we could work with it as well.  \n\n\n***Prison World:***  \n\n\n&gt;*\"In a world built on the foundation of magic there are those who are given too much. Those who have the most powerful of powers get sent off to \\[to be named\\] prison. One where they live out the rest of their lives hidden from the rest of the world.\"*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Alien Plant:***  \n\n\n&gt;*\"A group of astronauts from the year 2171 are sent into the far far reaches of space looking for new alien life they have yet to discover. An comet hit the rocket they were in and sent them crash landing into a world they had no idea was there. No contact with the human world of earth leaves them to wonder this planet on their own.\"*\n\n  \n***Wild Wild West:***  \n\n\n&gt;*\"Two time travelers are taken back to an incorrect year and are left stuck within the wild wild west. These two time travelers have no way of getting home or so they think. With the limited technology of this time the two travelers believe if they work hard enough to fit in and collect what they need they can get out. But what trouble might be in their way could cause their plan to back fire.\"*\n\n  \nThese are just general teasers/basic ideas of what we could do. I'm really feeling interested in the last two, but we really don't have to do them we can just work with whatever honestly.   \nI'd really like to incorporate some romance within this story, I'm mainly looking to play female characters as my mains, but I wouldn't be opposed to playing male characters as side character or if we are having more than one romantic relationship going on I could defiantly play a male for that.  \n\n\nThis all isn't per say set in stone, I'd really be happy with anything at this point. This roleplay will be happening over discord and I'd like my partner to be lit and above. If this interests you feel free to comment your discord so I can add you or you can dm me and I'll add you like that. I hope who ever reading this is having a wonderful day!",

            "selftext": "I am 22F living in Europe (CET) with about 9 years of rp experience and looking for a longterm rp partner. I roleplay both female and male characters so I am pretty open to whatever you like to play. Before I get into my ideas here is what I am looking for:\n\n\\- Please be 21+\n\n\\- I rp in 3rd person. No using asterisks. Write in full sentences please. I also write multiple paragraphs. Depending on the scene around 1,000 - 3,000 words. So please be descriptive.\n\n\\- Please actually be literate! Making typos is no problem. It happens to all of us. But please provide me with a writing sample if you would like to rp with me. I've had people claim they are literate before and then find out they really were not.\n\n\\- Depending on the rp NSFW should be alright with you but I never want it to be the main focus.\n\n\\- No anime pictures as character references.\n\n\\- Don't ghost me!  If you feel like the rp isn't working out for you, you don't have enough time or you need to take a break: Communicate. Just let me know and we're cool. I've been ghosted by too many role players I've met on reddit, even sometimes after writing for a really long time, sometimes after just a few replies.\n\n\\- I rp only on Discord.\n\n\\- I usually rp MxF, but sometimes also FxF and MxM, so let me know what you are looking to rp.\n\n\\- This is not a rule but it's nice to have: I like making friends with my rp partners, so feel free to just chit-chat in ooc.\n\nThank you for reading my rules. I don't want to come off too harsh but I'm so tired with people either not reading the \"rules\" or ignoring them.\n\nThese are my ideas for possible role plays:\n\n\\- Vampire-Romance: The classic. Vampire falls in love with a human (or other supernatural being). Setting is preferably historic. I am a big fan of Dracula so I like the idea of a vampire lord (or lady) falling for a human.\n\n\\- Supernatural: \"Saving people, hunting things. The family business.\" I love the show Supernatural but I only do OC role plays. So we would be playing two hunters on the road, solving cases and hunting monsters. This rp can include romance, but doesn't have to.\n\n\\- Supernatrual-Romance: NOT the show Supernatural.  Just a romance including supernatural beings. Werewolves, Witches, Sirens, Faeries, etc. I'm very open here. Could be in a fantasy world or a modern setting.\n\n\\- Medieval fantasy: Two characters on a quest. Would include lots of world building. Can include romance, but again, doesn't need to.\n\n\\- Slasher-Romance: Horror meets Murder-Mystery. This is an idea I've had for a longer time. Character A and Character B start dating. After some time A starts suspecting that B might be hiding something and begin to investigate. But never in their wildest dreams would they have guessed that B's secret was quite so bloody. Is A going to be one of B's victims? Will A turn B in to the police and help catch a serial killer? Or is love really blind and A can't bear the thought of loosing B - and ultimately becomes an accessory to murder?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll these ideas are obviously only rough drafts and I am looking forward to incorporating your ideas into a role play. I look forward to hearing from you!",

            "selftext": "Hey folks! Me again, I\u2019m looking for some roleplay partners that might be interested in doing a Star Wars inspired prompt with me, although I do have some OC\u2019s if you aren\u2019t a fan of Sci-fi and would rather a more down to Earth story! (Pun totally not intended) I\u2019ll try to keep this as brief as I can :))\n\nIn no way am I an expert on Star Wars, I only watched the films in 2019 and have been desperately trying to read as much as I can since then. Who knew there was so much Star Wars stuff out there?\n\nI\u2019m looking to set this roleplay in the Old Republic era, but I\u2019m happy to also do other time periods, if you\u2019d rather! I have a smuggler OC, they\u2019re a Twi\u2019lek and they go by Cyd\u2019Azuul, or Cyd for short! \n\nThey\u2019re your classic \u201ccriminal-who-needs-money\u201d sort of character, I try to keep them as close to chaotic good as I can. We can discuss more details in DM\u2019s and whatnot! I\u2019m also open to romance, but only if you stick around to get to know my angsty Twi &gt;:33\n\nI\u2019m also totally open to doing other ideas too, for example I have a human OC named Frank Katz who works as a journalist, and Aeres who is a tiefling mage!! I don\u2019t have prompts for either of these characters, but I\u2019d love to come up with something if anyone is interested! They\u2019re both relatively new so I\u2019d love to get some mileage on them! \n\nIf anyone is interested, feel free to give me a DM and we can go from there! I\u2019m looking forward to hearing from you! &gt;:33",

Then go through this dangerous world together. \n\nI imagine it being something like this. \n\nIll play a young boy. Recently abandoned by his parents and now living on the streets. Desperately trying to stay alive off of what scraps he can steal. Each night trying not to freeze to death. \n\nAs for the specifics of your character its up to you! Will she he Filled with rage as humans have recently killed/captured her young. On the warpath and just butchering any humans she finds to satisfy her need for revenge. Until she finds me. Filling with pitty and taking in the child. Finding comfort in raising something after losing her young. Or perhaps, deciding she could steal a human child to trade for her stolen young. \n\nFrom there im thinking we progress through my character getting older. Yours figuring out how to care for something thats not covered in armored scales and able to fly. While as i get older trying to learn how to fight. All while we avoid capture by enemies that would love to use me as leverage to make you fight for them. Maybe with your character eventually finding a mate. And there could be conflict with him not wanting your adopted son?\n\nIm open to play this on reddit or discord but discord is by far and away the favorite. I write in first person but dont care what you write in! :)",

I'm Nevarges and I've been roleplaying for more than half of my life at this point!\n\nI tend to write around 4 -5 sentences in a single response, though I can write multiple paragraphs if I'm feeling it. All depends on what's happening and what the flow of the story allows.\n\nI'd prefer that you were semi - literate, but literacy doesn't play a huge role in this. I just enjoy a roleplay a lot more when the words I'm reading make sense.\n\nI've been pondering the idea of a post - apocalyptic roleplay based on either a show or a video game I can't quite remember the name of, I've never seen something like this posted, so my apologies if it isn't unique.\n\nThe Long Dark takes place in a brutal  winter after a very intense geomagnetic storm - there is no more power, no electronics work and most people are dead. Humanity has essentially been put back a couple hundred years with most people having no idea how to survive.\n\nI'd like to take this and turn it into a romantic story with bad things happening left and right.\n\nSend me a message if you're interested!",

            "selftext": "Good day to those who's interests i've caught. I'll start off by saying that i'd preffer to RP with someone around my age, so below 18 years old preferably. I tend to do OC/OC RP's, but i'm alright if you want to use a CC. Ill use CC's in addition to an OC if everything goes well, and if we've discussed it. Final few things: Please do not vanish. If i dont reply for a while, DM/@ me, ill reply asap. I live in the CEST/UTC +2 Timezone, so keep it in mind.\n\nOnto what i'd be interested in doing, and about how far im caught up:\n\nOne Piece - Ive recently been rather obsessed with the world of One Piece, so i'd absolutely LOVE to do a One Piece RP with someone. Although im not caught up all the way, only to the end of the habaody archipelago. So please, No spoilers! Ive already made an OC, so we can begin pretty quickly, probably.\n\nDemon Slayer - A series Im rather familiar with. Watched the anime, the movie and read the entire manga, so dont worry about spoilers here. I dont have an OC for this yet, but I'd love to discuss what kind of Dynamic our characters should have.\n\nMy Hero Academia - Also rather familiar with this. Watched the anime, the movies and caught up the entire way to the manga. No worries either. Just tell me where you want to begin, and how you want to do it, and ill be fine!\n\nDragon Ball - Everything but the Movies and GT (Although i have watched the Broly Movie, and im caught up to the manga) Im not that interested in this, but if you have a great idea, then im all in for it! I've already got at least one OC ready.\n\nJujutsu - Just the Anime. Not the most familiar with it, and no spoilers for the Manga. Ill do my best though and such.\n\nAnd i've probably forgotten about something, so if there's something you want to try that i havent listed here, then please tell me! I hope to hear from you soon! Ill be looking forward to it. So yeah, DM me here if you're interested, we'll talk it over, and ill probably give you my Discord Username and Tag right afterwards.

I also exclusively write as original characters: I think it's awesome when fans shape the pre-existing characters and worlds they love into stories of their own design, but I feel like trying to write alongside an established canon character stresses me out (trying to get the tone and feel right), so OCs only, please! With that out of the way, here's the prompt that's been rattling around in my imagination:\n\nMatthew Starling has always lived a pleasantly normal (if occasionally mundane) life. A native of the mid-Atlantic, Matthew fit the mold of the quiet boy next door: Goalie of his high school soccer team, graduating near the top of his high school class with a reasonable scholarship to a university in the Southern states, blonde hair that roguishly remained in a near-perpetual state of bedhead, blue eyes beneath a pair of trusty glasses, boyish freckles speckling his cheeks, and a slightly sheepish grin. In his first semester of college, outside of a close circle of friends in his pre-med program, Matthew goes largely unnoticed, which, well, is nothing new.

Until the day he became famous.\n\nOf course, the how/why of Matthew's newfound brush with fame is something I want to establish together! Does Matthew's private hobby of playing the piano become public, with him ending up being courted by record labels for a deal? Does a clip of an embarrassing prank played on him go rampantly viral? Does his just-for-kicks YouTube channel develop an enormous following almost overnight? I just think it would be super fun to explore how a college student who enjoys his plain life adapts and grapples with his life feeling like a grand spectacle, a three-ring circus that's quickly growing out of his control.\n\nAnd that's where your character comes in! Who she is and how she fits into the picture is something I want to leave entirely up to your imagination, although my hope for this plot is for it to have romantic-comedy-kind-of-vibes.

Or another idea that you think would be fun to write as! Seriously, I'm all ears. \n\nIf you're interested in telling this story together, please send me a message (not a chat request) with an idea for the character you'd like to write opposite Matthew, a potential cause for Matt's sudden fame, and what their dynamic might be!

I\u2019m T, (that\u2019s what I go by at least until I know you a little better) I\u2019m a female playing a male character and have been roleplaying for roughly seven years now. \nI am a literate writer and can write anywhere from 300-500+ words per response. I only use discord for role play, and I usually go over the word limit with my responses. \n\nI would love for somebody playing a female role to come and get involved in a long term slice of life role play with me. I write in the third person 100% of the time in a novella style. (No ** except for emphasis of words in speech) \n\nI have several ideas for plots but am open to ideas!\nSome of my ideas:\n\n-Age gap relationship\nThis is a relationship where John (my oc) would be 15-25 years older than your female oc. They would face hardships such as the female characters parents not accepting him, people in public mistaking him for her father and the female character being called a gold digger etc\u2026 they are together for love only and, even though they have their fights and arguments like any couple do, they always sort it out. Open to ideas on this though with ages, characters, whether they have children or not\u2026\n\nI have several more ideas but am interested in what you might say! Please pm me if you are interested or want to know more about John, he is an extremely developed character of mine so I\u2019ll be prepared for any questions you may have.\n\nThanks for reading!\n-T",

I\u2019m recently 30 so I\u2019m looking for partners who are at least 20 (it\u2019s just a comfort thing on my part). I also only rp in 3rd person, and I prefer mxf or fxf for pairings. I primarily play female characters but will happily play some male side characters when the situation calls for it. As far as length goes I\u2019m not super picky, I just prefer to post match. I currently have a ton of free time since I just had surgery and I\u2019m home from work.\n\nOkay, so now that that\u2019s out of the way! I rp a lot of romance, but I also love platonic family plots. I don\u2019t have any one idea but quite a few bouncing around in my head but I would love to hear others as well! As far as genres I rp I\u2019m mostly into some fandom ( Harry Potter, Star Wars Disney/Fairy Tales, Sherlock, Marvel and DC, and most recently Shadow and Bone)historical plots(especially Regency era), fantasy and sci-fi, and slice of life, I also like some supernatural plots, as well as a few other things too! I\u2019m up for just about anything right now! I will say I have been having a craving for something with Sherlock, Mythological, Harry Potter, or a good family plot.\n\nTo talk and plot more just message me on here and we can trade discord handles. I\u2019m currently central time but I\u2019m typically up pretty late!",

            "selftext": " I'm looking for an RP set in a post-apocalyptic world where magic has returned. the metaphysical equivalent of smacking reality with a D&amp;D book has happened and the world has been irrevocably changed forever. The old world has collapsed, but a new one has begun to grow from the ruins, one that has as much in common with Mad Max as it does Lord of the Rings. One of the major things that happened was that great waves of magic washed over the globe, and in their wake, people, plants, animals and the very landscape find themselves transformed into something more fitting this new fantasy environment.\n\nSomeone caught in the wave might be transformed into an elf or a dragon or some sort of dryad, their suburban neighborhood might suddenly find a faerie grove in the middle of what was once the cul-de-sac, their dog might be transformed into a warg. Or nothing might not change at all, it's all seemingly random.\n\nI would be playing a character who has thus far been able to bunker down and avoid the strife outside and also avoid being changed. But as their food runs out and they need to leave their safe hiding spot, they find that perhaps magic has an idea of what they should become. Specifically they discover that they're slowly transforming into a centauress. The story would focus on them exploring this changing world as they themselves are changed.\n\nI do hope you find this idea interesting and if you do, please feel free to shoot me a message! I can't wait to hear back.",

            "selftext": "Hi there! I'm Zero, I am Non binary and 32 years old. I'm looking for an RP buddy, be it a one shot or maybe long term. I'm looking for a literate RP buddy, someone who writes 2-5 paragraphs per post. Not super fussy about tense but would prefer 3rd person.\u00a0\n\n\nAnyway, on to what I am interested in role playing right now. I am interested in a modern fantasy (super flexible about what that world entails, would love to work out details collaboratively with my buddy.) However, the situation I'd like to explore is two supernatural creatures trying to both pretend to be human around each other, trying to keep their true identities concealed. I'd be open to supernatural being x human as well, but really want to RP some tension and secrets. I wouldn't mind trying an antagonistic start to the relationship, maybe something along the lines of reluctant roommates in a college dorm that don't get along immediately, but also down for strangers meeting and building their relationship from there. I prefer M4M for characters but am open to other genders, but I generally rp males or NB characters myself.\u00a0\n\n\nAnother is a Dragon Age rp, only OCs. This one would be set in a Circle of Magi. I would like this one to follow a templar and a mage and their rocky relationship that hopefully leads to feelings for each other. I'm looking for a really slow burn and the two of them greatly disliking each other to start. I'm looking for someone to play a templar for this one. I have a few plot ideas for this which I'm happy to go over in chat or pm.\u00a0\n\n\nSeeing as I am 32, I'm looking for buddies that are at least over the age of at least 21. I would prefer to RP with other LGBTQ folks, but don't feel like you can't message if you aren't! I'm hoping to make friends as well as rp buddies. I work full-time so I won't be replying a lot, but I will try to respond at least once a day. I don't expect daily replies, so if you're slow to respond that's totally okay with me. I'm only interested in writing characters that are 18+ and would prefer the same from you. I prefer to RP over PM or chat here on Reddit but am willing to move to email down the road.\n\n\nIf this sounds like it would float your boat RP wise, please feel free to reach out via pm/chat. :) Looking forward to hearing from you!",

At least, be able to post multiple paragraphs if need be, though I'm certainly not strict on wordcount. Sometimes, a snappy response is more effective.\n* Your character should be male.\n* You should probably have an image of them, or at least a rough appropriation, though this isn't set in stone.\n* You should be somewhat proactive, as I'm willing to expand the world according to what makes the story better!",

Now if that isn't your style no worries, I have plenty of other ideas as well!\n\nMy writing style is generally in the first person although sometimes the narrator in my slips through the cracks in my armor. In terms of how much I write... well it honestly depends, I don't tend to be overally descriptive, ie. describing how pretty the butterfly that just got eaten by a bird that was then swooped up by a bigger bird, etc. I would say that overall a paragraph or two ranging from 5-15 sentence each is my geberal go too lengths. What's in these is dependent on the character I'm playing though. Ie. If she is a lone wolf or a quiet ranger perhaps then I might focus on being more descriptive then normal, however if the character is a queen or witch perhaps dialogue might be the main focus. \n\nAnyways, feel free to message me in anyway you're comfy with!

But I do understand that sometimes the reply doesn\u2019t have to be long. As long as it\u2019s not just one liners all the time. I usually play in 1st person. Hope you don\u2019t mind. \n\nI enjoy getting to know my partner as well. So we can add to the tension and chemistry in the roleplay. If you can connect off of it then you can connect during it. \n\nI am in the uk, so the time difference will be there. But I post everyday and I usually stay up late as well. So you\u2019ll always hear from me. If I can\u2019t roleplay or won\u2019t be on I will give you notice in advance of that happening.\n\nIf you want to discuss anything or ask me anything I\u2019ll happily go into more detail in private chat. I look forward to creating and building a world with you.\n\nI have an idea I have been looking to try or expand on :)\n\nAlso if your not interested or happy how the roleplay is going. Just say and happy discuss how to make it better for us both.\n\nHope to chat soon :)",

I\u2019m hoping I can find someone to make this a fun plot! I use Discord. \n\nWe had always been best friends since we were younger, throughout school. Our parents knew that we liked each other and looked forward to the day that we confessed to one another. When I find out that you\u2019re leaving for the military I find out that I\u2019m pregnant (We went to a party where I slept with a guy.) We promised to meet up before you left and say our goodbyes. While saying goodbye you told me that you had feelings for me but before I could even respond I ran away, afraid since I knew I felt the same but you had no idea that I was pregnant. While you were gone you never wrote to me because you were so torn up that I ran away from you, seeming like I wanted nothing to do with you. It\u2019s a few years later and you come home because of an injury. \n\nThis all takes place after graduation. We have always been pretty close, causing people to think that we\u2019d be a think. The both of us had feelings towards each other but both had reasons why we never really acted on anything or confessed. Although I only live with my dad, I found myself growing close with your parents as well which helped after you left and I had my child. (The parents can be changed if you\u2019d like, It can be adapted to your own character.)",

            "selftext": "Hey everyone! With summer in full swing, I'm stuck at home with nothing to do. So, I was hoping to find a roleplay partner!  Currently, I'm looking for a dramatic, heated, slice of life roleplay. Before I talk about my prompts, I'd like to specify what I look for in a partner.  \n\n\n* Please be 18+. This is generally a given, but I'm neither interested nor comfortable with writing with minors. \n* I prefer quality over quantity, so I usually match however much my partner gives me. Generally, I go for 1-5 paragraphs, but as long as you give me something to work with, I'll be happy.\n* Someone who doesn't ghost. Yeah, this has been said a million times, but please, if you're not happy with something, or need to take a break or anything like that, voice your concern with me. It just leaves me with some closure.\n* Someone who uses Discord, since that's my preferred platform.\n* I'm fine with both points of view, with a preference for third. If you like first more, that's totally fine by me.\n* This isn't necessary, but if you're also a student or someone on break, that would be fantastic. It would just make lining up our schedules a lot better.\n\nNow, I'm looking for a Slice of Life prompt. Nothing against other genres, but I've done a little too much fantasy for now, and I'm just looking for a change of pace. I have a few starters, but I honestly think of a bunch of new ones at random, so if you didn't like any of these, message me and ask me if I have any more, \"Bonus\" ones, or if you'd like to suggest one of your own. With that out of the way, here's the ones I have in mind: \n\n**Hard Worker**\n\nMy character works at a very well known financial company. Although he makes a small fortune every time he gets payed, he's shy with girls, and struggles to find the time for a relationship in the first place. That, and his chaste workplace professionalism means that the girls that do flirt with him at work are usually turned down. Until, that is, your character gets hired for an internship position.\n\n**Cabin Fever**\n\nThe summer after their University graduation, my character, your character, and two of their friends decide to take one final trip to a little cabin in the woods of North Carolina. Our two characters leave the day before their friends, and right as they get there, a large storm that was supposed to head south changes direction, and stops their friends from making it down to their vacation spot. The next stormy week unfolds, with our two characters slowly falling for each other in the absence of their other friends.\n\n**New Roommate**\n\nMy character, after recently graduating from University, decides to move to a new city. After just one month of living there however, he decides that he needs a roommate to pay his rent reliably. He gets a few applications, most from guys, but a few girls here and there; so, he decides to take a bit of a risk. Even though he's not the hottest guy out there, he decides to go for it and accept your character as his new roommate, hoping to someday end up with her. \n\n**Newlyweds**\n\nAfter having dated your character for all four years in college, my character proposes to yours on their graduation day. A few weeks pass, and as they pack up their old life and move to a new city, a few problems arise. Since they're just barely adults, they still have to deal with irresponsible spending, fights over money, and a healthy work/life balance.",
