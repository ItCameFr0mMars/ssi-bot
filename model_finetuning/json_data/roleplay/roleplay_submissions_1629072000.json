I would love to have a partner more dedicated and committed that if either of us get busy, I won\u2019t just be abandoned for someone else! \n\nCurrently out of work, so I have a good bit of free time while I hunt for a new one! I don\u2019t have any particular ideas, right now. If you do, I\u2019d love to hear them! I love a good fantasy setting, historical setting, sci-fi, but I\u2019m open to collaborating. Having a craving for something dark, maybe with vampires, or werewolves, demons, dragons, merpeople, or magic. You get the gist, I like mythical beings. I like you playing mythical beings. If that\u2019s not your cup of tea, please still message me!     \n\nI\u2019m just usually NOT into Slice of Life, modern settings, or Fandoms.    \n\nA little about me. I am 28. So please be around my age. I can\u2019t be doing this with an 18 year old, sorry, be at least 24/25? You can be older, just don\u2019t be too much younger. I\u2019ve been role-playing on and off since I was about 14, so this isn\u2019t anything new. I\u2019m on the east coast of the US. Reply length doesn\u2019t really matter to me, the longer the better, of course, but it\u2019s quality over quantity. I tend to match my partner. I don\u2019t really have any limits when it comes to quantity. I typically play female character, but I am willing to play side characters as needed.    \n\nAs I said, I don\u2019t have any specific ideas in mind, I\u2019d love to hear anything! I can also work with you to come up with an idea, if you have none and I like our vibe. Oh! Also, I don\u2019t want this to be just business. I\u2019d like to also make a new friend, and occasionally have conversations outside the story. If that\u2019s cool with you?    \n\nWell, I think that\u2019s everything! I appreciate you taking the time to read it all! If you\u2019re still here, and are still interested, please shoot me a message, maybe start off with a joke! Give me a bit about you? Maybe a writing sample? If you just say hi and not much else, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll respond. I look forward to meeting you!",

I have a lot of free time but I won't be writing 5 paragraphs each turn so don't get mad if you write more than me. I try to put effort and thought into my writing but I'm not gonna go overboard. If Im in the mood I'll often do a lot of world building and take the lead in the rp but after a while it might get tiresome for me. A good way to spot this is if I start reusing concepts or not really doing anything eventful. \n\nI prefer to do eventful fantasy or sci fi rp with a touch of romance and so forth most of the time but I also do calm romance rp and others. I do have limits when it comes to rp though so keep that in mind.\n\nI don't have dedicated ocs but I make fairly decent ocs off the top of my head following a structure i have. I do things this way so I can use one oc and change it to synergise with the rp.\n\nLastly. Please don't take me for a fool. If your gonna rp with me please put effort into it aswell and make sure I actually understand what's going on. You wouldn't believe the things I've seen people try to get away with. It's just rude and disrespectful.\n\nIf your interested DM me on reddit and ill respond when I can.",

So hopefully you're cool with that :)\n\nI have a few plot ideas but nothing that's set in stone. I'm open to any ideas you might have as well as doing something other than fantasy! I'll also mention I prefer to play with original characters rather than fandom based stuff.\n\nI'll also mention here that I'm 20, he/they, and use discord to rp. I'll write at the least paragraph per response or more. And I write in the third person.

            "selftext": "Hello! I am looking for anyone who would be interested in doing a role play with me as one of the three characters from RE, those being Donna, Sheva, or Zoe. Now I won\u2019t try and force you to play inside a small box so if canon needs to go you\u2019re more then able to break it if need be for whatever ideas you might have if mind don\u2019t interest you. I am also looking for a partner who is literate. I\u2019m not one for one or two like, I like details, I like to read a lot of text with details some might consider excessive. From the clothing ones is wearing to the wall paper on the wall type of detail. \n\nNSFW is also completely fine by me if that\u2019s the role play you\u2019re wanting to do, just let me know ahead of time so I know about it. I don\u2019t mind violence either but again let me know what you would like to do. So onto the ideas.\n\nSheva\n\n1. Infect/Taken/Turned. For this idea, it\u2019s quite broad, but the reality of it is Sheva is infected, taken by Wesker and much like Jill is controlled, or if you would like an alternate universe, joins Wesker.(Come on, mad man taking the world and leaving a few that are deemed fit for the continued human race is hot.) Either she can join him during the game, willingly, before the game, or is defeated and given a choice to live or die.\n\n2. Tribal Sheva. A silly/comedic idea I know, but lets be real, if Sheva was really in the tribal outfit, you think things would turn out the same in cutscenes if the villains or hero\u2019s saw her like that? Especially in such clothing while wielding either a gun or the bow. So don\u2019t pull any stops of what you want with this idea, I\u2019m all ears for it.\n\nZoe Baker\n\n1. End of Zoe/Aftermath. From everything that\u2019s happening after the events of RE7, Zoe being found is one of them. Things however can go a bit differently I feel like then how they went, that\u2019s something we can decide, from other people to how able Zoe is all the way to what she\u2019s wearing. If you would rather deal with the aftermath however of everything, that\u2019s more then fine with me as waking up I think with white hair and your uncle being the only person you have left can be quite the ride of it\u2019s own. How would life be after that?\n\n2. Through the house. So it\u2019s known Zoe had been living on her own by the property and moved in and out of the house throughout the infection. This idea would be based during that time, she had her little trailer, and was looking for the serum Mia talked about. What possible things could happen during this time? Up to your imagination.\n\nDonna Beneviento\n\n1. Alternative Ending: A rather simple idea, but instead of dying to Ethan trying to stop him from leaving, Donna instead just lets him go with the flask. He having played her games and beating them. What would happen afterwards? Would Chris and his team find her, would someone else? Would she be put into therapy due to her development, or thrown in a deep pit? So many possibilities.\n\n2. A Fantasy: With Donna\u2019s powers, she can make quite the illusion for just about anyone. Who\u2019s to say the gardener and Ethan were the only people to have a taste of it, who else could there have been? A simple idea.\n\nThat\u2019s all I have, and remember, I\u2019m always up for your ideas as well, don\u2019t have to do mine if they\u2019re not interesting to you o you have one you think is better.

I have a few plots already in mind, but I'd also love to hear anything my partner might want to do. I'm also very eager to brainstorm and hash out in more depth--as well as share headcanons, do some world-building, and create aesthetics. I also prefer to match my partner when it comes to reply length, so we can discuss that too. No one-liners please (: \n\nPlease don't interact unless you're an adult.

            "selftext": "Hellohello. Still searchin' for a pal to RP with. :)\n\nNames Ethan, he/him, 28 years old, lit to adv lit, prefer discord.\n\nWhat I am looking for in a partner; someone able to write lit to adv lit - which I would define as reaching at least three paragraphs for a standard reply. Honestly, I'm not picky about it, I just need details and characterization to work off of, both of which I offer in return in my replies as well.\n\nI'm interested in building up a world based on FNAF - explore how souls mix with machines, or how sentient machines interpret the world while they witness murders at night and cheerful friendliness at day. Truthfully, I'm more vibing FNAF since that setting has an environment that is especially tough on it's characters, but I'm down for Detroit BH stuff as well.\n\nCanons are fine with me; OC's are fine with me. Lemme know what you prefer. I'm fairly flexible on all of the canons, but I will need practice with the Detroit BH characters.\n\nMy fav characters to play:\n\nThaddy Foster (OC)\n\nBonnie (Fnaf 1)\n\nFoxy \n\nPuppet (FNAF 2)\n\nToy Freddy \n\nToy Bonnie \n\nMangle\n\nFuntime Freddy (Fnaf 3)\n\nIt'd be nice to brainstorm and plot a little together. Part of what I am searching for is also a friend to goof off with and be nerdy with - while of course writing some awesome content. This is why I do offer plot idea's - but they are only idea's. Little glimpses into what I have to offer, mere templates for you to add your own idea's and wants and desires on to...\n\n\\- The animatronic gang have always been sentient and alive since they were created - born as clueless machines at first that observed the world and learned. 40+ years pass in which they must endure being treated as unloved objects; even being taken apart and left for dead, only to be brought back unexpectedly. They take solace in whatever they can, from each other's company, to music, games, stories, or even taking out their frustrations on the Night Guards... But finally, the gang has had enough. They are determined to somehow free themselves from Faz Ent's shackles; but they might need to use a human's help in order to get anywhere....\n\n\\- One day, yet another child dies at a Freddy's location. But rather than moving on to whatever afterlife may exist, they find their soul is trapped within a machine - a discontinued, child-sized knock-off brand of robots that had been thrown away and abandoned. They must navigate this new, terrible reality - what makes things worse is that the other, much larger machines are alive, too. But it doesn't seem like they were ever human...  \n(Human becomes an animatronic, meets the animatronic gang. How will they respond to each other? Suspicion or acceptance? Misunderstandings or communication?)\n\n\\- A \"helper bot\" belonging to a young man are the best of friends. They are practically inseparable; for good reason, as the helper bot is meant to assist with special needs at any given moment. But while they barely manage to meander through their own lives, their \"mother\" (the robot's creator, and child's guardian) has opened yet another one of her new businesses. A cutthroat business woman, she's somehow managed to out-greed and out-corrupt Faz Ent, and bought a line of animatronics to use in her own store. The boy and bot are wary; their mother is ALWAYS up to something bad... And not only that; if the helper bot is able to become \"alive\" and more than just the sum of their coding, could these new animatronics do the same?  \nAnd are they already alive?",

Just a fluffy SoL romance, to feel a bit better. Its one of those things where Im pretty much going to play as myself, but better in every aspect possible \ud83d\ude02 What that means, is that  very much like in my real life, I want your character to be feminine. Whether that is a man, woman, trans, whatever, doesnt matter to me. Im looking to write a bit, so maybe like 300 words per post? Except for dialogue heavy moments, of course. Thats pretty much it. Thank you for reading this far! :) I like the idea of a college setting, but Im always open to suggestions. The idea is to make this as long term as possible. Im totally fine with going until the characters are 80 years old and with kids \ud83d\ude02",

Currently, I am looking to use one character in particular of mine, his name is Vincent MacN\u00e8il! He is a World War One based character and was a soldier during the Great War. The plot I would most like to use is this:\\*\n\nY/C is a German medic (or just a medic) my character, Vincent, has been injured and is left bleeding out in the middle of a mostly abandoned no man\u2019s land. (Injury varies although i\u2019d prefer something a little dramatic etc) will your character save the others life, although Vincent is British? And.. if so- do they become friends? Or lovers, even.\n\nEven though this is the plot I would most like to use I have a few others and I am happy to send them in a PM or come up with plots together! I prefer the plot to be set at the end of the war (or near it) or completely after the war.\n\nI prefer MXM (bxb) relationships- I find them easier!\n\nHere is Vincent\u2019s character info: Vincent grew up in Scotland on a tiny, very quiet and isolated island called Iona. ( as he calls it, \u00cc Chaluim Chille)  \nHe grew up speaking Gaelic (he can\u2019t read or write in English, fun fact lmao) he left home, and ended up renting a farm at about the age of 16 which he worked at, and loved until the age 19 where he immediately enlisted into the British army, into the highland light infantry and off to France he went. He enjoys art, it\u2019s a pastime of his and he always has some sort of small book shoved haphazardly into his uniform and a pencil, which is usually actually stolen from someone else.\n\nHe is very cheery and light-hearted, it\u2019s a little put on because he is trying to keep spirits up as well as cheer up those around him. He is cheeky and not very smart.\n\nHe is about 5\u20194, he is slim, Perhaps more on the underweight side of the scale, although he still is fairly strong from working at a farm for his whole life. He is very, very pale with bright blue eyes and freckles splattered across his nose and cheeks ( which usually are flushed somehow) mostly- although he has some more dotted elsewhere where. He had chin-length curly dark brown hair, which is usually tied up haphazardly at the back of his head.",

            "selftext": "Hello, I'm looking for someone for an original sci-fi plot or a fandom rp. For posting size I usually do multi-paragraphs. I also usually play more then one character. For the original idea below it helps flesh out the crew. Also can play npcs as needed. This is open to whatever sort of character you want to bring in. \n\nFor the original the idea is a crew aboard a cargo ship scavenging the remains of a ruined galaxy. In this setting there was a federation-like government spanning most of the known galaxy. It was founded with noble intent, but as it grew in size the cracks began to show. With dozens of literally alien cultures coming together there was bound to be some friction. Petty grievances and misunderstandings snowballed out of control leading lines being drawn. Eventually sides were chosen leading to a war that lasted far longer then anyone intended. Precious few places escaped the conflict unscathed. Billions are dead, entire planets have been ravaged, and the remains of countless vessels drift throughout space. Even after the end though one must make a living. So come aboard and start picking at the corpses of the old worlds.\n\nThen here's a list in no specific order of assorted fandoms I'm interested in.\n\nElder Scrolls- Any era is fine. Huge variety of adventures are possible. Rise up in the ranks of House Telvanni, party with Sanguine, etc\n\nLegend of Zelda Botw- Fantasy adventure across the vast fields of Hyrule and beyond.\n\nMass Effect- Turians are pretty cool.\n\nXCOM- Shooty adventure.\n\nHelluva Boss- \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af\n\nFeel free to DM if interested.",

As the title states, it's been a little while since I actively participated in a roleplay, so I'd love to partner up with someone who is patient enough to deal with any errors that might occur on my end (though I'll obviously try and keep it to a minimum). \n\nFor your convenience, I've put together some bulletpoints so you can decide if we're compatible:\n\n* Post frequency once a day, possible twice or thrice, depending on day and circumstance. Let's agree on atleast one post every day. You can expect atleast three paragraphs on my end, though this is more of a guideline than anything else. Sometimes more is required, sometimes less. Willing to provide writing sample if asked;\n* Third person only, hard rule, sorry;\n* While I'm open to any sort of relationship dynamic, the only type of romance I'm willing to write is one of queer nature, including FxF, MxM, FxNB, etc. etc. Also open to platonic pairings! Think childhood friends, for example.\n* Some genres I'd love to explore are **post-apocalypse, modern, fantasy** and **slice of life**. I could possibly be persuaded to do something **sci-fi** as well, though I'm not that familiar with the genre.\n* While I'm not active on discord, I'd prefer to use the platform as our main source of correspondence. Email, reddit and google docs are also options.\n* I'd love to try multi-cast! I've never done it before but it seems like a fun challenge.\n\nThanks for getting this far. If I managed to peak your interest, feel free to shoot me a message. Please do include some information about yourself. Could be anything really. Anything but a simple ''hi how are you'' is a big plus. Hope to hear from you!",

Reply length or experience dosent matter i just ask you to have an open mind and the ability to make sense with your posts. Must be 18+\n\nSo my ideas are:\n1.You're a famous pop star or actress and im hired to protect you but through spending every moment together one of us develops feelings (dosent matter to me) and has to decide to tell the other or let it eat away in secrecy.\n\n2.After your break up with your boyfriend your friends drag you to a wrestling show where I bump into you (literally) but you don't know that im one of the wrestlers.\n\n3.You are out celebrating your birthday with your family when you see me sitting alone. Your parents have always controlled your relationships wanting you to be with someone upper class. You decide nows the time to take control of your love life\n\n4.Another wrestling one based on a story I read. We both are on a reality program to earn a wrestling contract. Your a world famous rock star and im going for my child hood dream. We both have different reasons for this but through it wr make a connection first as friends then as a couple. We can start at the beginning or jump in at the storys end and see what happens afterwards.\n\n5.We have been best friends since we were kids and you decide to move for a job while I stayed in our little home town. You come back home to see family after a couple years and hope to see me. When you see me outside my house memories come flooding back time spent together, me being there after your break ups, being each others first kiss. Will you be brave enough to admit the new found feelings? Will I feel the same after so long?\n\nI have some other basic slice of life roles if thats more your thing. Im fine with NSFW elements. I use kik, Reddit chat, or discord.\n\nHope to hear from you.",

            "selftext": "The red-eye flight was the cheapest option, and for Colin Fitzgerald, a college freshman working two work-study jobs (bookstore clerk and manning the library's front desk) to stay afloat amid the looming specter of student loans, it was the right call. But as he steps off his flight and shuffles sleepily into the narrow concourse of his small hometown airport, halfheartedly pressing his glasses back up his nose, he's pretty sure he'd have emptied out his savings account for a decent night's sleep. The walk over to the luggage carousel fills Colin's nostrils with the all-too familiar scents of day-old coffee and clean linoleum, and he closes his eyes in a long blink as he props his elbow up on the guardrail of the nearest escalator.\n\nThis sleepy airport in an even sleepier town was precisely the reason Colin departed his hometown to pursue his collegiate dreams at a big city university. He probably could've settled for an education degree from the town's local community college, but doing that would feel like admitting defeat, like he'd end up stuck there forever. So even though it was more expensive, Colin chose to chase his teaching aspirations at a prestigious institution states away. But, now, for fall break, he was back. Not stuck, at least, but back.\n\nHe ruffles his hand through his bedheaded blonde locks as he finds an uncomfortable-but-sturdy pole to lean up against near the now-spinning baggage carousel, cracking a slight grin as he spots his rollaway bag spinning in his direction. As he scoops it up, he quirks an eyebrow: It's lighter than it should be. Much lighter. In a slight panic, he kneels down on a plastic bench and unzips the suitcase, spotting an eclectic (and, honestly, pretty embarrassing) collection of items that were certainly not his. And then, folded neatly on a crisp sheet of stationery, is a note:\n\n\"If you want to recoup your belongings, you'll have to embark on a scavenger hunt to find them before dawn breaks. The girl with the olive-colored luggage and the bewildered expression will have your next clue. Good luck!\"\n\nColin feels his heartbeat start to race. This was going to be a crazier night than he'd anticipated.\n\n\\*\\*\n\nHi, and sorry for the long introduction! I'm looking for a writing partner to play as Colin's partner (the girl with the olive-colored luggage, to be more precise) in a lighthearted scavenger hunt for their belongings that lead our two protagonists around the city. Whether our characters have never met before, or are old childhood friends, is entirely up to you! I just figured it'd be fun to thrust the two of them into some zany antics as a playful meet-cute. As far as the items that have replaced their luggage: I thought it'd be fun if I come up with 10 things in your character's bag, and you come up with 10 in Colin's! Some might be helpful for the scavenger hunt (a car key for a rental, maybe), or lead them to certain landmarks around town (a stuffed animal for the zoo? a tutu to lead them to the ballet theater?), or just be plain silly and embarrassing.\n\nIf you're interested, please be at least 20, and up to writing at least as much as I did in my introductory post. And, if this prompt catches your eye, please send a message with a possible item that's in Colin's suitcase as the subject line. Looking forward to writing a rom-com scavenger hunt with you soon!",

            "selftext": "Greeting heroes! I come here today to offer a chance to romance, fight, and/or convert a not-so-average B-list villain who is on the rise. Backstories aren't typically found for such scum, but our intel picked up\u00a0 and pieced together their backstory from diary entries. Proceed with caution.\n\n~~~~~\n\nLife had been comfortable for me. I grew up with parents who climbed the social ladder from their own middle-class roots. I attended private schools all my life. We even could go on vacations every once in a while around the world when I was young. My parents were never desperate for cash, held multiple homes, and cars with no debt. They made it.\n\nAnd I made it too on my own in record time. Not like anyone can really know how. Do you know how someone can be rich yet cash poor? You're looking at him. When I was 8, I witnessed the Great Recession. I didn't know about how scary it was, the cause, or even how my parents would ever be affected. All I did know was that I came across some weird paper on the internet about this thing called the blockchain.\n\nIt made no sense to me, but little me, in all my genius or naivety, decided to pursue this blockchain. Bitcoin popped up. I can 'purchase' a new asset class in however quantity I had. I put my entire $20 per week allowance into it for years. When it took off in 2013, I'd become a multi-millionaire when I was in middle school. I was playing with house money so I continued to buy with that $20 (now $50 plus another $20 for picking up dog poop).\n\nI started college, early might I add, nearly a billionaire. Three comma net worth, and bitcoin continued to rise. Then 2017 happened. I was close to being the richest man on Earth. Time to take chips off the table, only a little to get a comfortable house near campus and maybe hire a maid. That was when reality set in.\n\nAbout a year later, as Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency markets crashed, I got sent a letter by the IRS. They wanted to question me about a large transaction into my bank account. How odd. When I went to speak with them, the tax world was laid before me in all its monstrous ways. I had to give up 40% of what I earned.\n\nAnd so it was at that moment, with my resources, that I decided that I didn't want to be taxed at all. I wasn't going to leave this country though... I just had to be clever. Bring down the banks, government, etc. All who stood in my way of my tens of billions of dollars all tucked away. \n\nThe newspapers thought it was more a crusade. Bring down the corrupt banks who screwed over the people for decades, the politicians who were corrupted by those same banks, fossil fuel companies in an environmentalist riot. I laugh at that in private. It makes a good cover though. All I wanted was to get my money, and villainy would be a way to 'wash' my crypto profits.\n\n~~~~~~~~~\n\nHello beautiful people of this subreddit - I'm looking to play against a heroine today. Must be over 18+, write detailed enough (6-8 lines minimum) and otherwise come to the table with some ideas. PMs only and I'll be moving this to discord.\n\nToodles",

I am over the age of 18 and expect you to be as well as I NEVER RP with minors AT ALL! No spoilers for the newest season please, I have not seen it yet :s\n\nFirst things first, I have a few rules but the most important ones are: \n\u2022Please have decent grammar; \u2022One detailed paragraph minimum!\n\nI can play as the following characters:\nMiami Morty\u2665\ufe0e; Evil Morty\u2665\ufe0e; Evil Jessica\u2665\ufe0e(Not really an OC but ya know. Not in the show or anywhere else I think. So a Jessicasona lol)); Bonnie Sinclaire/Diane; Morty; Summer \n[Current faves = \u2665\ufe0e]\n\nWhen it comes to genres I really like romance, angst, serious topics and comedy! Also I have been told that I\u2019m pretty creative with plots HOWEVER it would be very very nice if you were to bring something to the table as well. There\u2019s nothing worse than a writing partner that does not put in as much effort as yourself!\n\nI\u2019d prefer it, if you could go with a canon character as I\u2019m not a big fan of those 'typical cringy' type OCs, please respect that and no offence to anyone whatsoever! It\u2019s just not my cup of tea \u2615\ufe0f. Send the emoji above if you\u2019ve read trough the post carefully. Any other questions? Contact me! Let\u2019s discuss!

            "selftext": "Hello, everyone! I hope that title has piqued your interest.\n\nI\u2019d like to introduce myself, first and foremost. I\u2019m a female, currently in the GMT+1 timezone with about 7 years of roleplay experience. I can write anywhere between lazy lit to novella style responses averaging 3-10 paragraphs. My go to is third person, past tense. Usually only the tense is negotiable. I prefer to only write with those 18 or older, as I myself am in that age range. My only rules are for you to be fairly literate and bring your own ideas to the table. Respect and communication are a two way street, of course.\n\nNow that I got that out of the way, I\u2019d love to roleplay in the Medieval era as we explore the relationship between a young Queen (played by me) and her loyal personal guard (played by you). Their ages would be 18 and 23/24, respectively. Please note that this does NOT include any fantasy elements.\n\nThe basic premise is as follows: the two have known each other for quite the longest time; the palace had taken the knight (your character) in since he was 7 and trained him until he was knighted at the age of 15. That means the Queen would have known him for almost her entire life. She trusts him with her heart and soul. They were very good friends up until she was 13, but their friendship sort of crumbled away after her father\u2019s death, which was almost 3 years later (at 16).\n\n(They could have both been in love at that time, or it could have been a platonic relationship, we can always decide on that later.)\n\nThe knight would always try his hardest to regain whatever is left of their relationship, but she had blocked and closed him off entirely, to the point where they might as well have been strangers who see each other almost daily (remember he is her *personal* knight). Because of his high status, he usually gets a say in some affairs, but the Queen has been giving him the cold shoulder as of recently (meaning the past two years).\n\nThe plot will follow the Knight\u2019s attempts at winning her heart back; there will be tension and arguments, of course, but also many heartfelt moments. I\u2019m a sucker for romance, so eventually I\u2019d love for it to head that way. Again, this will be a slow burn, with both parties giving and taking.\n\nYou can create a character that is cool, calm, and very collected but stubborn at times, or simply a spitfire but a sweetheart deep down. It is up to you!\n\nWhen you message me, tell me more about your character and what their basic description is as well as their personality. I won\u2019t respond to just \u201chey\u201d or \u201cwanna RP?\u201d It shows that you don\u2019t care enough and I frankly won\u2019t waste both of our precious time. If you reached the end, send me your favorite dessert somewhere in your message.\n\nLooking forward to all your responses! XX",

            "selftext": "The land of Kenshi was always ripe with interesting stories, though none was ever as strange as the story of the Bone-Dog Man. First sighted in the northern deserts of the United Cities, believed to be of Greenlander blood. They say he has no face but only the head of a vicious, blood dripping Bone-Dog where one should be. A dangerous Katana of Meitou quality kept at the side of his waist at all times.\n\nMany people thought that this was merely another tall tale spun by the roving caravans, until the venerable, noble and Godly Emperor Tengo put out a bounty for the Bone-Dog man\u2019s head. One hundred thousand cats, to whichever brave soul could find and either deliver him or destroy him. Delivering his head and blade as proof of the deed being done, the pay alone was enough to have any United City Resident set for an eternity.\n\nThe story for why Emperor Tengo put the hit out goes like so, from the grapevine: one day, one of the Emperor\u2019s beloved cousins had gone out with a small party to do some innocent hunting of people to add to his collection of \"property\". Suddenly, a beast in black descended upon them, slicing apart ten conscripts, seven sergeants and even two seasoned captains. Finally eviscerating the Nobleman and leaving his corpse to bleach and dry in the hot sands. Truth be told it wasn\u2019t one of Tengo\u2019s loved cousins, in fact he actually hated the guy. However, the matter was that someone dared to lay a hand upon the nobility, that someone had the nerve to think themselves equal and kill one. This could not stand and could not serve as a beacon to the rebels already terrorizing the desert.\n\nSince then, sightings of the Bone-Dog Man have been reported all across with the stories of the legend becoming increasingly outrageous. Some claiming seeing him at the border between the Holy Nations and United Cities where he hacked several Inquisitors to ribbons. Another story of him passing through the Shek Kingdom where he wrestled down one of The Chosen. Supposedly, he spends his free times in the Cannibal Lands simply battling the many tribes just for the fun of it!\n\nWhether these stories are true are not are up to heavy speculation, though there\u2019s one thing for certain; he is still out there. The bounty is still up and with the wars raging on, it leaves plenty of opportunity for adventurous Mercenaries to find and bring him down or perhaps to see if the stories are true and find a new companion..\n\n\\[If you\u2019re interested feel free to send me a private message with your info! I'd ask you also have some knowledge of Kenshi preferably.\\]",

            "selftext": "Hello there :)\n\nI am looking for a partner to roleplay a romance, with a sort of \"opposites attract\" vibe. This trope would be used in a sense where your character would be the good Christian type of nerd, a good person who means no harm and simply stays out of trouble for the sake of being a nice fella. However, he couldn't help falling in love for their friend. Their polar opposite, a girl who repeatedly got herself (and often both of them) in trouble.\n\nThis roleplay would explore how polar opposites are easily capable of having a good and healthy relationship. Regardless, \"corrupting\" your character would not be the focus at all. After all, she fell in love for her friend from whom they are, and she has no intention of changing them whatsoever.\n\nFeel free to play characters of any gender. This bisexual queen will be happy anyway. The setting itself would ideally be the last year of highschool, where they're 18 years old and on their very last year of school. However, I would be willing to hear any suggestions you may have.\n\nIf you are interested, send me a message. I will send you my character's description and a few more details. This should be played in third person, past tense. I do not use discord, but feel free to use either PMs or chat.\n\nLet me know if you're interested :)",

I don\u2019t have many rules just a few simple ones. First no one liners, I dread when people do that it\u2019s so unbelievably hard to work with. I normally tend to put out more then 3 paragraphs although this mostly differs on my partners responses I like to write around the same length. Now for the second and last one no ghosting, I completely understand real life comes first if you get disinterested that\u2019s fine! Just shoot me a message. Now that is it onto details the types of rps that I play out the most, are fantasy and action. I\u2019m not sure what it is about it. That draws me so into these worlds, it\u2019s just so fun to get lost in them I love it. For timing I try to put out as many replies as I can I\u2019ll give you a heads up if I\u2019m busy. Since Covid I have been working from home, so that gives me a bit more free time on my hands. As for platforms I tend to only use discord though if you\u2019d like we can definitely talk about the plot and what not through here! Now I do think that\u2019s about it? Of course we\u2019ll talk through all the details and hopefully make a story together! Just shoot me a message bye bye now!",

            "selftext": "Hey there, 23F from AUS (for time zone reasons) here looking for an Rp partner.\nI have a bunch of in-depth existing characters (but always willing to make new ones) and I use 3rd person and typically 1-2 paragraphs when I write (typically more if establishing a starter or a new scene though). I don't mind if you don't write heaps as long as you still contribute to story and world building with me!\n\nI dont have anything specifically in mind at the moment but I'm always into sci-fi, fantasy, supernatural, romance, horror/gore themes. Typically perfer Rping as non humans personally like potential super heroes, vampires, mermaids, aliens, demons, deities and the like.\n\nMy mind also changes often so I might get the urge to start up another one either dropping the original one or continuing that one *as well* as the new one cause my neurodivergent brain can't help itself.\n\nI have a lot to deal with in the next few upcoming days so I might not be *super* quick with my responses but I will definately be interested in sinking into a good story!\n\nLeave a comment below or shoot me a message if you're interested in Rping at all, hope you have a good one!",

I'm a 26 year-old woman based in the UK looking for advanced literate, longterm roleplay partners to write at a hopefully steady pace with on Discord!\n\nI am a fast writer with a lot of availability right now, and would really love to hear from people that might be able to **post once a day or more** with relative consistency. I write upwards of a few paragraphs but prefer Quality over Quantity and don't expect everyone to match me necessarily if the pacing feels right.\n\nAs for plots, **I tend to play men** as my mains but am comfortable doubling and taking on several roles in a story. I am not looking for fluffy SoL, nor romance as a main focus. Heavily-Feel-good stories don't tend to keep me engaged. Instead, I am hoping for **plots with a lot of grit, darkness, adventure, deception, political intrigue, and conflict in general**. I am most comfortable in low-fantasy setting, whether historical or modern, but am open to other genres as well.\n\nMy favourite plots revolve around Enemies to Friends, political hostages and power struggles.\n\nHunted and outcast magicians, vampires and vampire hunters, haughty noblemen, conmen and rogues are all character archetypes I can easily get excited for. I have quite a few stray plots along those lines, but I'd be happy to discuss those in detail if we seem to be a good match!\n\n**Please don't message me if:**\n\n* You only want to post once every few days - I am very excited for RP and a new post often makes my day! If a scene drags on too long, I tend to lose that engagement.\n* You're looking for romance heavy plots. I play romance if it happens organically, but seldom seek it out from the start.\n* History or grittier plot details don't interest you at all. Whilst I'm no history nerd, I am really looking for a fictional world that feels realistic enough and allows for sensible political plots.\n\n18+ only, please, preferably 22+. \n\nIf the vibes I'm after sound good to you,I'd love to hear from you! And **if you do want to get in touch and speed up the introduction, please let me know:**\n\n* Your timezone and availability. I am in GMT and would want at least a couple hours of overlap within our free time to facilitate effective communication and maybe allow for more than one post a day, if you're up for that.\n* A writing sample! I'll definitely request one, so if you have one lying around, feel free to include that in your DM.\n\nI'll be happy to give out my discord in DMs and discuss further!\n\nAs a final note, I don't ghost, and I am a big fan of honest communication! RP is the kind of hobby where I feel the right match is crucial, and neither of us needs to waste their time if we're not into it. I'll be straight-forward and expect the same in turn!\n\nHope I caught some interest, and best of luck to you all with your own searches.",

            "selftext": "Hello, everyone! Just to get straight to the point, I am looking to do a roleplay premised on the concept of two extremely close best friends turning into enemies, maybe to the point they have to kill one another. It will probably be a fantasy or sci-fi setting. I am big on visuals and would want us to have references for all the characters. As it is a fantasy or sci-fi setting though, I prefer animated characters as opposed to real life models, because it is easier to imagine the characters as animated in this context. It is quite a broad concept, but I think there is so much behind that concept for me \u2014 and I especially want the two main characters to have a deep love for each other.\n\nThat said, the best friends shouldn\u2019t actually sleep with each other. There can be a lot of \u201cfan service,\u201d and I do want them to find each other very visually attractive (although both should have main female love interests). However, as you can guess, actually sleeping with each other breaks the \u201cbro code\u201d and ruins the relationship I\u2019m trying to get.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to know these anime references at all, but the best examples of this theme for me are Scarlet Nexus and Gundam SEED. If you know Scarlet Nexus, you know exactly what I\u2019m talking about, and you probably know the character I\u2019m a huge fan of already. And you probably know exactly why I\u2019m into this concept right now because of the show. Gundam SEED is another great example \u2014 basically two childhood friends who have to fight each other when they\u2019re on different sides of a war. Again the roleplay doesn\u2019t actually need to be based on these two shows \u2014 we can do an original story based on the general concept.\n\nOf course, a lot, and I mean a lot, of world building is necessary. The roleplay would be centered around the two characters who go from best friends to enemies for whatever reason, but there should be many other characters as well.\n\nFinally, in terms of writing quality, I probably have a different barometer than most. It\u2019s not about post length for me. Obviously, a lot of people use post length as a bright-line rule to weed out the bad role players, and I completely understand that. However, it\u2019s a hard search, but I\u2019m looking for quality even deeper than that. Someone who really intellectually engages with the characters and the plot \u2014 someone who will love the characters we write about especially. That\u2019s how I\u2019ll really know if it\u2019s a highly literate roleplay or not for me.\n\nThat said, I don\u2019t mind long posts at all, and it demonstrates real effort. I\u2019m just saying I also recognize the writers who understand the art of minimalism. If you can convey eight paragraph\u2019s worth of content in two paragraphs, that\u2019s a skill too and has a beauty of its own. That\u2019s also something I\u2019d recognize.\n\nWe can discuss more in the chat or PMs if you are interested!",

            "selftext": "\nHi all. I\u2019m Abbie (my online name), and I just got back into role play after years of being out of the game. I used to be a big roleplayer (was big into Harry Potter, Twilight and Glee rps) years back and then life got in the way but I\u2019ve gotten back into it. I\u2019m also a fanfic writer, and that hasn\u2019t stopped really, so I\u2019ve still got the skills in me!\n\nI\u2019m in my 30s so looking for someone 21+ for comfort level. I role play in third person paragraphs, usually a few paragraphs per response but also tend to match whatever my partner puts out. Looking for specific pairings from fandoms but I will play either character in each of them. MxF. Currently on summer holidays so lots of free time on my hands! \n\nLooking to start something right away and have a partner who is active! \n\n**Please don\u2019t start a line with me only to stop replying a few days later. If you\u2019re busy, I get it, just let me know. Being ghosted is not fun, especially when excited about getting started. \n\nI love doing daily life sorts of plots with romance that are canon-compliant. Would like to use discord as it\u2019s easily accessible to me and easy to work with. I am on EST time and am usually online in the evenings after 7pm EST until 1-2am.\n\nI\u2019m only looking for one of two scenarios CANON CHARACTERS ONLY  (no OCs) please:\n\n****JULIE AND THE PHANTOMS - Netflix show 2020 (Julie and Luke):\n- I will play either character\n- Happy to do something either continuing where the show left off at the end of season one or something AU (maybe Luke is alive, maybe they\u2019re in college, maybe he comes back to life etc etc)\n\nHARRY POTTER (Hermione and Ron):\n- I will play either Hermione or Ron, have experience with both and love playing both (I also write Romione fan fiction) and am happy to show off samples/my writing for this\n- Would love to do some AU things for 6th year onwards OR after the final battle with them getting together\n\n\nPlease give me a shout on here with a message if you\u2019re at all interested and we can chat and see if it would be a good match/trade ideas. Please read through this post and only message me if you are good with everything I\u2019ve mentioned. Would love to get back into this as I\u2019ve been missing for a while and have missed it. I love the writing element as well.\n\nHope to hear from you!",

            "selftext": "Hello, posting here again. \n\nI am semi lit, can go into Novella style writing. Just depends on my partner. I write in 3rd person past tense unless agreed upon by both parties. I do have an OC in mind for this idea, face claims can be drawn or irl, I'm not too picky. \n\nThe idea varies on what we can agree on. I have several plots from royalty, to a warn torn land. I prefer more creativity than following a rigid idea since this will be a story made by 2, not just the 1. I do mostly roleplay on Discord, but I can also here if need be. It can be romance or drama, though I am a sucket for a good romance story. \n\nIf you're looking for a pre-made plot. I do have some already cooked up.  \n\n1. Princess and her New body guard\nSounds exactly what it is. It's left to be vague as to allow for a better creative flow. \n\n2. War's Harbinger \nBasic idea, where my person would be the Villain in this. The person who strives to cause death and chaos. Could you be another warrior? A rogue drug into this? Perhaps you're the Kings Daughter who happens to catch the monsters eye. It's left open as well to allow more ideas to come in. \n\nI look forward to hearing from y'all",

            "selftext": "Hannah finished saying her goodbyes to her friends. She felt like she was Cinderella being pulled away from the ball. Her husband was her prince charming, and the pumpkin at the end of the night. Hannah hugged her best friend Ellie and waved to Tom one last time. Ellie was the only goodbye that mattered to her. It had been her event. Ellie was her best friend. Nothing came in between the two of them.\n\nHannah brushed her hair out of her face then clasped Lou's hand. \"Thank you, honey.\u00a0 It's 9:56. Four minutes early. That's better than last time.\" She added as she got into the car. Last time. She had made him promise to never talk about that. He had gone out of town for twelve hours. Overnight. Something they had never done. Every night they laid beside each other. How did she cope? She called him 56 times in an hour. Ellie had to give her a cold shower in the condo. Last time was one of the reasons they had moved out of the city.\n\nHannah fixed her husband's hair as they sat in the backseat. She undid the ties around her ankles and got out her phone to give him space. It was only a forty five minute drive home. Hannah glanced at her husband then looked out the window from the backseat. She idly played with her \"love\" ring. It was different from her engagement ring or wedding band. It was something that the two of them agreed to which honored their unique relationship so others could see. She wore it everywhere and during anything. It never came off unlike her other rings.\u00a0\n\n\u00b1+++++++++++++\n\nThanks for reading this! I'm looking for someone to play Hannah's husband. Who is he? Maybe a politician? CEO? I'd love to discuss their dynamic with you and get something going.\u00a0",

I do have a few requirements for any partners. I only use Discord, so please have one! I ask that you be 18+, and I ask that any roleplay we do includes romance, as I believe it greatly enhances the plot. Otherwise, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get along! \n\nFor the plots I had in mind, I\u2019ll start with the fantasy! I have a few characters in mind, but the specific plots I have in mind are rather general, so we can build upon them together! You can be whoever you\u2019d like in these roleplays, I\u2019d love for your character to be fully yours!\n\nA princess and her knight, a man who views the princess as weak and having never done work in her life.\n\nA young prince, on the run and in need of a guard.\n\nA man on a journey for revenge, joined by your character.\n\n\nNext, the fandoms! The fandom I\u2019m most interested in at the moment is DC, and I have a few canon characters I could play. I will say, I\u2019ve been dying for a story with Nightwing, so if that interests you, you\u2019ll immediately shoot to the top of the list! Some other fandoms I\u2019m interested in are:\n\nMarvel\n\nStar Wars\n\nLegend of Zelda\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2\n\nStardew Valley\n\nAnd that\u2019s about it! If you\u2019re interested in anything I\u2019ve mentioned, feel free to reach out to me! Even if not, I hope you have an amazing day!",

            "selftext": "Hello there!\n\nThanks for clicking on this; as you can tell from the title, this will be a post centered around Fandoms and writing within and about these fandoms. First, I\u2019ll go over a few little things and notes to have in mind, when thinking about possibly writing with me.\n\n* First, I am mainly looking to use *Canon characters* within anything we write. We\u2019re writing with Fandoms for a reason.\n   * This doesn\u2019t mean any OC you have is bad or anything. Personally, I like using characters already within a world. *Aka, I prefer in most cases, we use Canon characters.*\n   * That said, that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2018t include them time to time. Just, most of the time I will ask we use canon characters.\n   * Some ideas will need more OCs.\n   * And some will require only OC's\n   * Head canons and altering canon characters to degrees is welcome too.\n* Next, for possible partners I ask that you are open to: **Writing in 3rd person.** Writing multiple genders\n   * Or, even open to writing multiple characters. I\u2019m not opposed to working as a Pseudo-GM of sorts If needed. Or even sharing GM duties with another.\n   * I enjoy writing multiple characters, sharing characters, and even writing as a GM/Pseudo GM\n* Types of genres I enjoy Include:\n   * Canon Divergent, Canon Re-writing, AU\u2019s, Mystery. Action/Adventure. Dark-future/time-lines. Time-loops. Slight Romance.\n   * If romance is included, my favorite pairing is typically FxF. Just so you know.\n   * I prefer we work on a plot/loose story before deciding on characters and such. **So, please do not** come into a discussion just asking what characters I will write.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nNext, some of the Fandoms I enjoy, And small ideas/concepts I might have for some of the following. Of course, we can build something from the ground up together. Or, alter any idea listed below. If you have any personally, please mention them too!\n\nIf anything here catches your interests, let's get in touch and discuss! **PM\u2019s** please, and not reddit chat.\n\nThese are not in any particular order.\n\n# Persona 5-verse.\n\n* So, one of the first thoughts I have here deals with a mixture of the games. Something I like to dub, \u201cRoyal Strikers in Starlight!\u201d But, for this, it is more of an Canon-divergent/AU. Basically, I want to start at the beginning of Strikers. Though, with a few different concepts; perhaps it is only the ladies coming together for the summer. (Joker can be gender bent) And Sumire is also here. And for the most part, it is a similar start to Strikers, until they encounter Alice. I loved her character-despite how little she had. For this, I want the girls to end up trapped in some warped reality of Alice\u2019s. A \u2018Wonder-land\u201d if you will. And the starting goal would be for them to discover and find a way out of this new strange reality.\n* We can go in another sorta of AU style; I had seen art of it before. Didn\u2019t see too much. But the main idea, was switching the main perspective of P5 from Joker/Rem to another of the Thief. Perhaps Makoto is our point of view. Or anyone! We can alter story beats and all sorts of stuff like this!\n* Perhaps a cross over with another game?\n\n# Kingdom Hearts\n\n* One of my favorites series here!\n* Though, that said- one option we have on the table- Re-work/re-write Kingdom Hearts III. I feel the pacing for that game is all over the place, and I had seen a video where one person tried making it feel a little more smooth. Perhaps even incorporate some of the humor/light-hearted nature the KH-Manga has. **Give Kairi more to do. Ya know.**\n* Maybe Give KHIII a little darker of a end/view. Not everyone gets a happy ending.\n* KHUX just ended. And while I have not played it all, I did watch a few catch up videos, and watched the ending. Perhaps we create some characters for this time; have them participate in the Keyblade war and maybe what happens after! (This one is more OC friendly)\n* Or, in a AU of sorts, kinda in the light of FFX-2, we can have an adventure with Kairi, Aqua, Namine and Xion!\n\n# Final Fantasy Series\n\n* Mainly FF7/FF7 Remake, FFX-2.\n\n# Jojo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure\n\n* I know, well enough parts 1-6. \n* I know a little of 8, and a little more than that for 7.\n* That said, very open for OC related things in this fandom. Though, probably more OCs than trying to mix them with canon. \n\n# Naruto Shippuden\n\n* Let\u2019s dive back into the Third Great Shinobi War! Seemed like a lot was going on in that time, and little actually. Perhaps, alter events, too!\n* I've also thought on perhaps re-working the Fourth Great Shinobi war. Not that I disliked it, but I do have some issues with things.\n\n# Fire Emblem: Three Houses\n\nI mainly know the Black Eagles And Ashen Wolves.\n\n# DC\u2019s. Arrow-verse.\n\n* I\u2019m weird here, I mainly wanna focus on the \u2018Next-generation\u2018 of characters. I.e Mia Smoak, Nora West-Allen, \u2019Connor Hawke\u201d John Diggle Jr, William Clayton.\n* We could go in the \u201cPre-Crisis Future\u201d the timeline not really shown. But, the one Prime Nora came from. I believe the Legends episode \u201cStar City 2046\u201d exists within this Future.\n* A \u201cPost-Crisis Future\u201d\n* Either way, I\u2019d like them to form up in the future.\n\n# Call of Duty\n\n# Power Rangers/Super Sentai:\n\n* One idea, leans towards the love of both. I wish to re-write/re-do, or whatever we want to call it. But, I wish to make Super-Mega-Force more like their Sentai Counterpart. As a big fan of Gokiagers, SMF didn't do it justice I feel. (Though, one can argue it did PR justice to some degree.)\n   * So, first thing we would have to do, is work on the team themself. We could keep the Mega-force cast, but I feel they served their purpose for Mega-force.\n   * Like in Gokaigers, the big war needs to happen before the pirate suits come up.\n   * An AkaRed substitute I had an idea for, would be Original Red Ranger Jason. Perhaps after the war, and the powers are lost to the galaxy, Jason goes off looking for a way to return the power to Earth's rangers. (Making him the AkaRed)\n* My other idea, we create our own Sentai themed team!\n   * This one would take a lot of discussion and set up, but could be fun!\n   * We could set up the writing as in 'Episodes'\n\n# Code Lyoko\n\n* Since I discovered it is on Netflix, I\u2019ve been re-watching!\n* I suggest, we alter their ages to make them around proper high school age. And re-write the series. Since, the show is a little weird with its pacing and story telling.\n* But I love all the concepts within the show. Let's take them deeper!\n\n# Dragon Ball Universe.\n\n# Persona and Persona 2.\n\n* I\u2019ve played these both! And love them both! Maybe more than 3 and 5. (I haven\u2019t played 4 yet.)\n* We could always do a Persona Q-style cross over, with p1 and p2, if we so desire.\n* Or, we can go in a more original route- our own Persona like adventure.\n\n# Boruto: the Next Generation.\n\n* I do not wish to have anything with Kawaki included in this. I do not know enough about him, to be comfortable having him included.\n* One thought I\u2019ve had, would be re-working Sumire\u2019s small evil arc; making it A little bit more. It had such a fun set up. And I adore her character. (Often ship her with Sarada in their futures.) But her up-bringing and attack on the Village- I\u2019d like to expand it further. I\u2019d have the same set up, but the attack and the after-math much more in depth.\n* I have seen Fan art, swapping Boruto and Kawaki with Sarada and Sumire- to be the two infected with the Karma. Could always be an angle to take, as welL!\n* Maybe we can try to keep the old theme of Naruto of \u201chard work\u201d over being a blonde boy that gets power ups.\n\n# Sword Art Online/Gun Gale Online\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nIf anything here catches your eye, let\u2019s get in touch! Discuss and see if we wish to try and write anything! Thanks for reading!",

            "selftext": "Hey Everyone! Thanks for checking out my roleplay post. I have been doing this for quite some time, around six and a half years. I am looking for a literate, female roleplaying partner. Most of the time, I reply with at least a few paragraphs. Usually most roleplays surpass three paragraphs and I am more than capable with keeping up. I roleplay in the third person.\n\nHere are a list of the Roleplay Ideas I had:\n\nStar Wars:\n\nBounty Hunter x Jedi Knight/Padawan: It is the early days of the galactic empire, after barely surviving order 66, you have been relentlessly pursued by both bounty hunters and Empirials alike. I have been tasked with bringing you in to the empire.\n\nJedi x Padawan: It is the height of the clone wars, I, a young, unorthodox Jedi Knight have been assigned a padawan as a punishment (or as the Jedi Council put it, \"an educational opportunity for both Master and Padawan) for my constant rule breaking. My missions are far from the ordinary, most of which involve body guarding, assassinations and other covert missions.\n\nBounty Hunter x Bounty Hunter: We are both high profile bounty hunters who have always been in competition. We have never seen eye to eye, but unbeknownst to us, we were both hired for a top secret mission, its success depends on how well we will get along.\n\nBounty Hunter x Princess: As the clone wars rages on, your father, the king of a prosperous neutral system, hires me, one of the top bounty hunters in all of the galaxy to protect you. Little do you all know that I have my own ulterior motives.\n\nJedi x Princess: Same as Bounty Hunter x Princess except I will be roleplaying as a Jedi Knight assigned to your world by the Jedi council.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm pretty big on world/character development. I'm also open to modifying the ideas to fit any ideas you may have had/have.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI roleplay on discord and kik so let me know which you'd prefer",

I believe the beauty lies in the details and makes for a really enjoyable story, so I would like my partner to be able to give adequate replies. That being said, I understand that life happens and if you need to step away for a considerable amount of time, Just let me know. I am more than understanding and will wait. I will not \"ghost\" anybody. If it isn't working out, I will let you know and we can either part ways or work it out and get our story back on track.\n\nin terms of scenarios, I enjoy romance, a slice of life and I have dabbled in a few survival/horror roles as well. I expect my partner to be able to build the story with me rather than me just doing all the work. Don't be afraid to add twists and turns.\n\nI only like to roleplay on Discord I like to have a channel for the roleplay, character descriptions, references and out-of-character chat. I can play multiple characters and will write descriptions as they become introduced, not as big as my main characters, just something brief. I write in the first person (me, myself and I) and I prefer proper grammar and punctuation. I have been roleplaying for over 10 years now and I like to think I am pretty good at it.\n\nIf you are still with me, I hope you are and are interested drop me a message. Tell me about you and what scenarios you prefer. I do have some recycled roles we can do or we can create one together :) If we seem to be a good match we can exchange our discords :)",

I know that may seem odd, but it's to help me work on my writing skills when it comes to creating said characters. That being said, this is sort of a test for myself, and I am new to roleplaying this way.\n\nI am a detailed literate (I can write a lot, but I'm a quality over quantity person) roleplayer who favors romantic themes, alongside fantasy, thrill/horror, action, etc! I also include side characters, and as I have a bit of experience in writing multiple characters liking one, may include some side male characters as well! Just hoping to get better at this.\n\nAs far as plotting/etc goes on my end, I'm looking for preferably a Medieval or Victorian period, perhaps Modern although I don't have much in mind of plotting. I'll either be playing a human guy(s) or monster ones (Ideally, a demon or dragon-boy, cause they look epic).\n\nI want to play a character in a position of power, a ruler, General, politician of sorts even. My plotting is very rough, as this may either take place in a time of a takeover, a war, or some other major event. If this vague idea interests you, then please, do tell me!\n\nLeave a comment, or message (chats, I don't like the message feature without the message bubbles, basically, sorry!)",

            "selftext": "Hey! I\u2019m Bridgette and in California for time zone reference. I\u2019ve been roleplaying for one year and absolutely love it. It\u2019s really a side hobby to sort of meditate after long days of school/work. All that aside, I do respond at least once a day during the week and more frequently on the weekends. In the near future, I will have more writing time as my work hours will lessen until I finish school.\n\nI started on Rook but switched to Unreal back in January until the app recently shut down:( so now I only RP on Discord. Aside from that, I love to write and let my imagination run wild. With that said though, I\u2019m not a hardcore novella writer. I prefer a happy medium. 1-4 paragraphs or more at times when the story calls for it, but I\u2019ll do my best to match my partner but at the same time, I would prefer to steer clear of those who are into 1-2 liners. Gotta keep the story build up going. We can discuss our characters and details on discord if I feel we connect.  \n\nI do incorporate NSFW but will not have the story revolve around that. I prefer more of a story buildup and let the rest fall organically. BTW, I\u2019m a straight single female only looking for a male partner, not female playing male (just my preference). \n\nDrop a comment or PM on here if interested and we can come up with something together, but please don\u2019t send one line messages or comments saying you\u2019re interested. I appreciate a little effort into your message as I would like to know a bit about you before seeing if we would make a good fit.\n\nThanks for reading and hope to hear back!",

Please only contact me if you are 18+, I am 19 and feel uncomfortable RPing with minors.\nUsually I am good at thinking of plots and I would be happy to discuss possible plots with you together, don\u2019t be scared to share your ideas, it does help me out a lot! :)\n\nSo now for the fandoms and who I can play:\n\u2665\ufe0eDeath Note\u2665\ufe0e:Light, Misa, Near, Mello | Killing Stalking: Bum | Ouran Highschool Host Club: Haruhi, Tamaki | Black Butler: Ciel (both), Sieglinde, Elizabeth, Alois, Maurice, Aleister Chamber |\n\nYes, I am open for all sorts of shippings (as long as they are legal), MxM and MxF (me) are preferred at the moment. \nIt would be great, if you used Discord, since I like writing there best. In my opinion the lay-out and design is pretty practical and easy to use. However we can also figure out something else. \nIf you are interested comment down below or shoot a message, I\u2019m rather desperate at this point because most of my fandoms have died out somehow and finding decent RP partners is tough :((( Don\u2019t be shy!\u2661",

So I am quite new to this subreddit and this whole idea of roleplaying normal characters, so be gentle on me! Whilst being new to this, I am quite experienced when it comes to roleplaying in regular, mostly NSFW! Being detailed, articulate and creative, I am seeking a guy or a girl to play who would be the same and someone who has some experience in playing. I'm a girl from the US IRL.\n\nAnywho, as the title suggests, I am a big fan of the series called NARUTO and BORUTO. I've been watching it for quite a while now and today I decided to try something new. As a fan of the show, my favourite character is Hinata, hence who I would play in this scene. I would prefer if we would stick to original powers and everything, but I am more than happy to play out a roleplay or a fight with some adjustments, with some new characters and a new story. Anywho, I am looking to build up a story here, don't know how to word it out different, hahaha.\n\nIf you're interested in hearing out more, feel free to DM me! :)",

We usually look at things from the perspective of the good guys. The Republic, the Rebels, the Jedi, but today...oh, today will be much different. We\u2019ll be going at this from the perspective of the bad guys. Not just the bad guys, the REALLY bad guys. The super-duper evil guys that make ghosts hide under the covers! I\u2019m talking, of course, about the Sith. \n\nI won\u2019t be doing this from the usual \u201cRule of Two\u201d perspective, we\u2019re going waaaaaay way back to the Old Republic. When the Sith Empire revealed itself after 10,000 years and sought to claim their rightful place as rulers of the Galaxy! And, y\u2019know, collecting artifacts and stuff...apparently. \n\nI\u2019m looking for someone, male female or anywhere in between, to play a female character. She will be a potential Sith on Korriban, going through the trials with a group of other force sensitives, all for the chance to become the Sith Apprentice to my character. Then the journey will really begin! \n\nThe Starter for this will be a little bit unique, as I\u2019ll be telling it from your character\u2019s perspective. Let me just state for the record that this is the ONE AND ONLY time I will be controlling your character. I will not do it in the actual RP, I just don\u2019t plan on introducing my character until the RP progresses a little bit, so this is just a way to establish the plot a bit more. I\u2019ll leave the backstory stuff to you, though, so don\u2019t worry about that!",

            "selftext": "A slice of life with the chance of darker elements and perhaps even a bit of mystery if the stars are in position. Two individuals from different social circles are bound by an unexpected meeting at Prom, only to be separated once more. The thought, \u201cwhat if?\u201d engraved into their minds before fading into a passing memory. However, it seems that fate has given them another chance. What will come from it? What has changed? More importantly, what hasn\u2019t?\n\nBeth. She was a bit of an enigma. In highschool she was known as a golden child. And no, it had nothing to do with her blonde hair tied up in a neat ponytail. She was a cheerleader, she played tennis, and was an honor roll student. In short, not the type of person you personally spoke with on a day to day basis. Let\u2019s just say your circles never...meshed. High up on that golden pedestal of hers, it was only a matter of time before it all came crashing down. Rumors had spread here and there as it always does in highschool. A small part of you was smug, there was always something about that picture perfect image that irritated you. A darker part of you was more than happy at the idea of that pretty little picture getting ruined. With twitching hands you couldn\u2019t help, but think of how much more satisfying it would be if you were the one that marked it up. Some might have called you bitter and they might\u2019ve even been right, you were far from perfect, but at least you were never fake about it. And maybe that\u2019s what irritated you most about Beth. It was almost as if she were wearing a mask, one that would eventually crack.\u00a0\n\nYou were lucky enough to witness it. You had no idea what you were even doing at Prom, it wasn\u2019t like you were going to win Prom King. With the dance floor filled with awkwardly dancing couples that were carefully monitored by a few high strung teachers, you crumpled up your punch cup and walked out with a sneer. Approaching the hall you see a figure, curled up in the dark with the sound of sniffles amidst the faint music that could still be heard. Internally you debated on what to do, with making a quick exit looking more and more appealing. However, watery green eyes would glance up and meet your own, leaving you cursing. It was Beth, of course it was. Bad luck aside, it seemed that she had it even worse off. She was a mess. Mascara streaked her face, nose reddened, and that prim proper blonde hair was loose in a curtain of curls that she used to desperately conceal her face from you. Suddenly your heart began to pound and before you even noticed, you had found yourself walking up towards her.\n\nThat moment of vulnerability that she displayed replayed in your head a little bit too often than you cared to admit as the years went by. That night you were able to see a side to her that it seemed that no one had ever seen, it was strange, the way you were pleased by such a small moment. A night filled with conversations that few would have dared to approach her with. That moment, that was yours. Graduation was all too soon, having not spoken to Beth yet aside from Prom, you were almost eager to catch a glimpse of her. And you did, much to your disappointment she was smiling in the way that she always did. Artificial. She ended her talk with her friends, before meeting your gaze. Your heart thumped louder as that irritatingly fake smile had softened into an authentic one, despite it\u2019s hesitation. She waved and seemed like she was about to walk towards you, until she was stopped by what looked to be her family. And just like that, it was over. High school was over, but it seemed that something else had began to fester, dying before it even bloomed. \n\nYears would pass, you saw no reason to keep contact with her, despite seeing her occasionally pop up on social media. Eventually those would stop too, but every so often your thoughts would drift towards her. It seemed that now was one of those times. Having established your own tattoo and piercing parlor, you had met a wide variety of clients. Regulars you\u2019ve worked on since you were an apprentice, sorority girls who would bat their lashes in an attempt to gain your attention outside of work, college students on dares, those in their midlife crisis looking for something to make them feel young. The bell to your shop would chime amidst the music that played faintly in the background. The first thing you noticed was green eyes that widened in surprise, the second was blonde hair tied into a neat ponytail. Your brows furrowed. Beth?\n\n\u2022 3rd person replies please, with character discussion before hand\n\n\u2022 You\u2019re more than welcome to be creative when it comes to your character, people change throughout the years, especially after high school.\n\n\u2022 I am flexible when it comes to themes you want to incorporate as long as it is discussed beforehand.\u00a0\n\n\u2022 I would like my partner to be over 18 as I am in my twenties. \n\n\u2022 A patient partner above all, I work long hours and overtime or six day work weeks is not uncommon for me. Sometimes exhaustion gets the better of me, but I will do my best to let you know. With that said I am also more than patient when it comes to responses.",

            "selftext": "So. Imagine yourself in a frozen forest- wait wrong script. Right. Erm. Imagine yourself in a sweltering desert? Not sure where I was going with this. \n\nRight! Uh. Hello! I am human William Holloway! I don't remember if that's my actual name. But that's okay! Mostly. Ahem. Right. So.\n\nLife sucks for your homeboy. All these ideas, barely 4  hours to think over them. And that's while I'm exhausted by football, work, or a combination of the two. School started and I regert. But I eased into it, and especially on the weekends I'm able to put time and effort into a roleplay. \n\nBut what roleplay ideas do I have, you ask? Too many to list and very few I wouldn't be embarrassed in telling. I'm not really good at coming up with *good* ideas, just ideas. And to that line, I'd love a partner who could take these figments and run with them. \n\nI'm a romantic at heart so let's start there. I don't like Twilight type romances. I don't like drama type romances. I like grity, dirty, in-your-face reality type romances where the two don't always like each other at the start.\n\nA soldier and his pilot being the only one to survive an insertion, and have to fight their way out of the city depending on each other. Weeks going by where the two have to get over their initial dislike of each other's personality and have to depend on each other intimately otherwise their survival is on the line. Insurgents everywhere, pilots not being trained for stealth. But pilots have survival training in regards to finding food and water after crashing, but soldiers have relatively little in comparison.\n\nOr a knight, infatuated with the princess he guards, but is hated by the royal family because he was framed for murdering an archduke who was an uncle or something, even though the archduke was a royal twat (hehe) and liked murdering people. But it was the knight's mother who actually did the killing, but to protect her, he let the blame fall on him. He couldn't be tried, because the archduke *was* in her house without permission or warrent, and as a knight, he *was* protecting her. The princess hates him as much as anyone else. Until she finds out the truth, and (insert drama that's actually cool here).\n\nA captive of war refusing to break to a woman who respects strength. The woman hasn't taken any suitors because of it. She's surrounded by politics and \"milk drinking\" politicians, yet the warriors she has met are crude and cruel. William is neither. William is just a young mercenary caught up in the wrong place at the wrong time. And he's most worried about getting food on the table for his mom and his dog.\n\nThat kinda stuff. I'm excellent at world building, and character's motivations for things. \n\nI'd love a partner who is completely unafraid to speak her mind. Who speaks up if she dislikes something and we can work together to tailor it or start from scratch. Someone who has her own ideas and likes to implement them. Who doesn't mind indulging on making a roleplay fun, and not just realistic. \n\nAnyways. I don't use Discord anymore, but apparently Google Hangouts is something people use here that's a decent idea? Or Reddit DMs. I'm open to ideas or suggestions on platforms, and short of my location and Facebook I can work with anything. \n\nSend over a PM telling me about yourself! Do you like puppers or kittens? Neither and think birds are supreme? Are you terrible at spelling or have scored a 36 on your ACT? Are you in college or still dealing with high school? Do you like ripped jeans? That kinda stuff. \n\nI thank you all who have read this through for your time, and I await with baited breath for my hot pockets. Just a minute left..oh yeah and for your responses too. Cheerio!",

            "selftext": "\n\n\n \n\nGreetings!\n\nPresuming that you've read this far, however little that is, I'm guessing that you may have an interest in setting up a roleplay for a fandom you enjoy. I won't keep you waiting for the list, so I'll put it up front as the next paragraph. However, my one request for you is to not disregard the rest of the post. There are still multiple facets, no matter how menial, to be recognized before we begin discussion.\n\nThe fandoms I'm seeking partners for are as follows:  \n\\-RWBY  \n\\-Attack on Titan  \n\\-Tokyo Ghoul  \n\\-Chainsaw Man  \n\\-Monogatari Series  \n\\-Kaguya Sama- Love is War  \n\\-Death Note  \n\\-League of Legends  \n\\-Danganronpa  \n\\-My Hero Academia   \n\\-Game of Thrones/A Song of Ice and Fire\n\nNow with that out of the way and people who have no interest in any of the listed fandoms gone, proper discussion can begin.\n\nFirstly, I am happy to roleplay through the mediums of Reddit, email or Discord, though discord is my preferred platform.\n\nSecondly, I am seeking partners with either semi-literate or literate writing capability. While I don't need or expect you to draft a new version of War and Peace (get it its a long book aha) for every response, I need something to work off of.\n\nThirdly, to the topic of plot. Obviously for each different fandom, there are greatly varying plots and surrounding ideas, though there are two main paths we would be able to take. First would be the simple process of taking the story of a fandom and simply passing through it with our OCs involved, seeing how they interact with the world and change the flow of events. As a second option would be to take the characters from our selected fandom and place them into an alternate universe. What this alternate universe would be is up for open discussion, I'm happy to hear any ideas you may have so don't be shy.\n\nFourthly, NSFW will *not* be a focus of the roleplay. I understand that with romantic themes, sex may be something that occurs within a story and I'm fine with it if it does happen. But do not come to this advertisement seeking something to sate you desires.\n\nFifthly, if by some miracle you do decide that you'd like to contact me about a potential roleplay, please give me something. I understand that you may not want to blow out a fully detailed introduction for a first message, but I do need something to review. Messages along the lines of the phrases \"Hey I'd like to roleplay\"; \"I want to rp *X*\" or \"Hi\" will be ignored.\n\nWith all that out of the way please feel free to send me a message of interest at any time this post remains available. I hope to hear from you soon so that we can get something going.\n\nRegards.",

            "selftext": "In the mythical land of Acrua, your power is all that matters. When you're born with magic, the amount you have, the ability you have, your control over it, those are the only things taken into consideration when you're given your rank. Those lucky enough, are born with the average power and rank, and thus, they have an average life. However, some are unlucky, and they are given the short stick in life. \n\nIn the Kingdom of Oniret, the Prince or Princess is usually betrothed to someone on their 18th Birthday. And the way this is decided, is that a tourney is held, and the one who defeats the other competitors can take on the Prince or Princess for their hand in marriage. And this was no exception for the current Princess of Oniret. She is one of the Strongest wielders of magic to ever be born. Blessed with plenty of magic, a useful weapon, and good looks \n\nIn this world, your magic and your weapon. Are closely tied together. Your weapon is a manifestation of the soul and of your magic. It can even be out in a mode where it will not cause lethal damage to the opponent.\n\n.\n.\n. \n\nThis Role-play will hopefully be a more long term one. You will play the Princess, and we can play this in any number of ways. Skipping to the final fight, having her watch them all, and maybe some other scenarios too. This is a open RP and I would love to RP it with someone! Now, I ask that you be muli-paragraph, since that is my own length. I can RP here (either DM or Chat, although I'm not too used to DM), or I can RP on Discord as well. This RP is meant to be fun, and it is romantic.\n\nI'm not too good with slow burn, but if you want to play it that way, I can try. If you want them to quickly fall for eachother, that is fine too. We can play this any number of ways, and it'll be all up to use how we decide to do it. So, if you're interested, do not be hesitant and hit me up! Thank you and I hope you have a good morning/afternoon/evening!",

I like first or third person, one paragraph to multi paragraph responses are fine with me. Be detailed and willing to keep the story going. I am in CST time zone. Obviously be 18+ lol. NSFW themes are ok with me as well. Dm me! No chat requests please!\n\nBelow are some plots to get us started:\n\n1. You're a young and handsome noble, just knighted by your uncle, the king. Though unlike most, you weren't given this title through your services to the realm. Your talents and swordsmanship are mediocre at best. In fact, many say you were only knighted due to your familial ties to the King. You ache for glory, for greatness and to be truly respected, but how? You know of a woman, an outcast that lives in a manor by the sea, past the haunted woods. The people call her a sorceress and all though magic is a most vile and unnatural talent, it's something you're willing to do use to make a name for yourself. She agrees to help you, in exchange for something of course. Money? No. Fame? No. Your soul? No, not that either. She wants a child.\n\n2. You're a prince, the late King's only legitimate son and heir. Your father was assassinated by a group of wealthy nobles who raised a coup de etat against him. You were a helpless child and were forced  to flee the palace by boat, smuggled there by your family's loyal maids and court mage before losing their lives. Years later, at the age of 18, you're now a bandit whose found their place amongst other outsiders. You're content with this life you suppose. Easy money, freedom and women. You no longer remember life in the palace, nor do you try and think of it. That is, until someone shows up looking for you.",

I\u2019m not too picky about my characters their gender (or sexuality for all that matters)\n\nCurrently I\u2019m reading the Night Circus and even though I\u2019m not even finished, I LOVE the concept of a traveling circus that allows supernatural creatures to show their powers, without \u201couting\u201d themselves to the world. Doesn\u2019t have to be that plot, but if you like the idea we could work from there :) \n\nIf you have a really cool idea I\u2019m probably up for it anyway, doesn\u2019t even have to be fantasy. Most important thing to me is that we click as people and that you\u2019re willing to write more than one character :) \n\nDiscord has my preference and please introduce yourself a bit if you decide to message me! Would love to know who I\u2019m talking to even if it\u2019s just an online name and pronouns \ud83d\ude0a",

            "selftext": "Hello, all! I'm looking to find some new writing buddies for some of the fandoms I'm most into right now! A bit to get out of the way beforehand; I'm a semi-lit writer, and depending on how much I like the story, I can write quite a lot! I almost always mirror how much my partner writes. (I prefer at least a paragraph,- meaning five sentences,- so I have enough to work with.) I write in third person only, and I ask that you please do the same if you want to write with me. Also; for the safety of myself and my partner, I ask that you and your character are of age. (I'm 19NB, myself, and I prefer my partners in the 18-23 range. I'm flexible on this, though)\n\nFandoms and Ships (starred characters are who I would be writing):\n\n[ Jujutsu Kaisen ]\n- *Gojo/Geto \u2661\u2661\u2661\n- *Gojo/Nanami \u2661\u2661\u2661\n- *Gojo/Sukuna \u2661\u2661\u2661\n- *Gojo/Toji \u2661\u2661 \n- *Yuji/Megumi \u2661\u2661\u2661\n- *Choso/Naoya \u2661\u2661\n- *Choso/Mahito \u2661\u2661\n- *Choso/Gojo \u2661\u2661\u2661\n- *Choso/Geto \u2661\u2661\n- *Choso/Sukuna \u2661\u2661\u2661\n- *Choso/Toji \u2661\u2661\n- \nDon't see a ship you're interested in? Ask me; I might have skipped it.\n\nNote: I'm REALLY into the idea of Choso x Gojo lately (or ANY Choso pairings, tbh) so I'd love to write them, but I'm pretty sure I'm like the only one who ships them lmao\n\n\nI write on Discord, as it's the best platform I've found for roleplay. PM me for my tag :-)\n\nIf you have any plots you've been really wanting to do, let me know! I myself am especially partial to angsty and/or dark plots!\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to send them my way! I don't bite!\n\nI hope to RP with you soon!",

I would love to have a partner more dedicated and committed that if either of us get busy, I won\u2019t just be abandoned for someone else! \n\nCurrently out of work, so I have a good bit of free time while I hunt for a new one! I don\u2019t have any particular ideas, right now. If you do, I\u2019d love to hear them! I love a good fantasy setting, historical setting, sci-fi, but I\u2019m open to collaborating. Having a craving for something dark, maybe with vampires, or werewolves, demons, dragons, merpeople, or magic. You get the gist, I like mythical beings. I like you playing mythical beings. If that\u2019s not your cup of tea, please still message me!     \n\nI\u2019m just usually NOT into Slice of Life, modern settings, or Fandoms.    \n\nA little about me. I am 28. So please be around my age. I can\u2019t be doing this with an 18 year old, sorry, be at least 24/25? You can be older, just don\u2019t be too much younger. I\u2019ve been role-playing on and off since I was about 14, so this isn\u2019t anything new. I\u2019m on the east coast of the US. Reply length doesn\u2019t really matter to me, the longer the better, of course, but it\u2019s quality over quantity. I tend to match my partner. I don\u2019t really have any limits when it comes to quantity. I typically play female character, but I am willing to play side characters as needed.    \n\nAs I said, I don\u2019t have any specific ideas in mind, I\u2019d love to hear anything! I can also work with you to come up with an idea, if you have none and I like our vibe. Oh! Also, I don\u2019t want this to be just business. I\u2019d like to also make a new friend, and occasionally have conversations outside the story. If that\u2019s cool with you?    \n\nWell, I think that\u2019s everything! I appreciate you taking the time to read it all! If you\u2019re still here, and are still interested, please shoot me a message, maybe start off with a joke! Give me a bit about you? Maybe a writing sample? If you just say hi and not much else, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll respond. I look forward to meeting you!",

            "selftext": "[[ I've been in a major funk as of late. I'm in search of that 'someone', who would be willing to become my rp partner as well as a friend. Please be 18+ and have Discord. There will be NSFW elements, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't want much of it. \n\n\nMy idea:\n\nMy character is an 18 year old freshman in university. He is a recluse. Raised in a strict &amp; controlling household and was forbidden from doing anything remotely fun including having friends over or going out for long periods of time. Subsequently, this leads to him seeking out introverted ways of fulfilling the void left by a lack of social connection. He resorts to playing an unhealthy amount of video games and reading fantasy/romance novels. After a mmorpg session, he receives a friend request from someone who played with him(he presumes it's a man). They exchange information and begin chatting with each other. She asks him to voice call, at first he is very hesitant and against the idea but gives in. At the first 'hello', he is enamored by her voice. They end up chatting every day and night, learning more about one another. Though, she has some things she isn't ready to reveal to him regarding her profession, afraid it would cause him to distance himself from her and break the relationship they had built. She views him as her savior, a brilliant light in her dark, miserable life. Eventually, they want to meet each other and talk about it obsessively--about all the things they would be able to do in person. He makes plans to visit her during the summer, as a surprise. \n\n\nWhen he arrives, he is immediately distraught by what he witnesses through the window of her home. Heartbroken and betrayed, he decides to confront her. The explanation he receives from her wasn't what he was expecting and leaves him in tears, making him fall in love harder than before. He takes her hand, pulling her away from the wretched world that so persistently seemed to want every piece of her while granting her nothing in return. \n\n\n[[ If you are interested in this, please reach out to me. Also, a huge bonus if you are the talkative type.",

Please note that I only RP with people who play male characters.\n\nRomance is welcomed as an additive to the main plot, but it is not always required - it\u2019s entirely optional.\n\nHere is the list of fandoms: Apex Legends (most muse for), Resident Evil (7/8), Tom Clancy\u2019s Rainbow Six Siege, Overwatch, Mortal Kombat, Borderlands, Bioshock, Dishonored, Tomb Raider, Valorant,  there are more, too many to list, I just didn\u2019t want a giant wall of text - feel free to add anything you may be interested in if you do message me.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested, shoot me a short message about yourself in a PM with your Discord username.",

            "selftext": "Heya!\n\nI'm a 19-year old guy living in Europe, and I've been looking to scratch that RP itch a bit. Timezone is CEST, but I'm kinda busy during large parts of the day so I might not always be avaliable. I will answer more than once per day every day though, unless there is some other reason. In those cases I will warn beforehand.\n\nI really love fantasy and I would like to play something with a lot of fantasy elements. I recently finished the Lightbringer series by Brent Weeks, and I find that magic system to be rather interesting, so that would probably be my top pick. That is rather niche though, so I understand that there won't be many people who are interested in that. I also kinda like Sanderson. I've read almost all of the Cosmere, and I am familiar with the magic systems there. I've read Kingkiller and a bit of Witcher as well, though I am not as interested in those. I also play a bit of DnD and am familiar with Forgotten Realms and Eberron as settings.\n\nI want to a full OC rp, since I find canon characters to be a bit restrictive. I would like for us to create our own world using magic and taking inspiration from the worldiin the book. In the rp itself, I am looking for action, adventuring and most important of all, romance. I really like wholesome slow burn romances that aren't love at first sight, but more slowly getting to know each other and falling in love, with some nsfw scenes as the relationship progresses. My idea is that we each play a main character that fall in love with the other, but we also play other characters outside the main pairing as well. As I am straight, I would like the main pairing to be MF, but I would love to include LGBTQ+ relationships outside of that one.\n\nI write 3rd person past tense, and I rp on discord. As I like getting to know the person outside of the rp itself, someone around my own age would be preferable. Shoot me a chat or a message if you're interested and we can speak more. I look forward to hearing from you all!",

            "selftext": "Hey all! Thanks for checking out my ad! I\u2019m looking for a few new RP partners to tangle with, and I\u2019ve been having a real hankering for some romance. I\u2019ve been really in the mood to explore shapeshifters, and admit that I am not at all interested in a sweet-as-pie teenaged romance. I'm hoping for something dark and gritty, and it might venture into some triggering subjects, so please be prepared for that if you're interested!\n\nThere will be adult aspects in the RP, so please be an adult, over 18. I'm 26, so absolutely no minors. \n\nTo put it right out there, I\u2019m looking to play as a male character in these rps, either in a FxM pairing or a MxM pairing. I am not interested in playing a female main character right now. I\u2019m happy to play side characters of course, though! Many of my prompts state genders, but if you find a plot that you like the look of and would like to give it a try with a different pairing then I am more than happy to oblige, just let me know!\n\nPrompts:\n\n**The Dragon\u2019s Bride**\n\n&gt; The village of Cavaugh\u2019s Pass have been sending sacrificial virgins to the Dragon\u2019s Lair for as long as the village has existed, centuries upon centuries, but every year for the past hundred years the virgin returns from the mountain to the village, swearing that no beast ever emerged from the cavern to claim its prize. This year another girl  is sent to be the sacrifice, but this year she doesn\u2019t return. Instead, a dragon finally claims its prize.\n\n**Paradise\u2019s Own**\n\n&gt; The beautiful creature was seen hovering out of sight of the expedition for weeks before she was finally captured, a dazzling bird with feathers of pure, brilliant ivory. Her song is of the purest beauty, and good luck follows her wherever she goes, making her worth more than any price could be named. Every night she sheds her delicate form and becomes human, and she is capable of granting one wish to the one who can win her favor. The longer she is a prisoner, though, the dimmer she fades, and soon her light will be gone entirely.\n\n**A Queen\u2019s Right**\n\n&gt;Once, the coastal nation of Abarra was known as a small, but wealthy nation reliant on dyes, seafood and pearls to fill their treasury. The nation, too small for a standing army, has kept its power through politics and diplomacy, but it seems as if honeyed words and jingling purses are not always enough. As war looms on the doorstep of the nation, the Queen of Abarra has shuttered its borders, hoping to withstand the assault by way of avoiding notice. Unluckily for her, war is expensive, and the wealthy, helpless nation is far too tempting to pass up.\n\n&gt;War, brought by the Invicte Empire, has left the continent in ruins. The black-clad army has trampled over all opposition, storming cities and raising a black flag with a golden dragon-- the mark of the Empire. Now, the mysterious leader of the army has locked his eyes upon the small, sheltering nation, and he will take it in any way that he can.\n\n**Of Monsters and Men**\n\n&gt;Humanity and monsters have lived in uncomfortable co-existence for as long as anyone can remember. Inside the walled cities of the Northern Expanse, humanity is safe. Outside of the walls, stretching high into the sky, monsters roam and rule, and humans are seen as just another rung on the food chain\u2019s ladder. Some unfortunate few, such as the traders and merchants and hunters and farmers, don\u2019t experience the safety that the walls provide. Instead, the dangers of the monsters roaming are a constant threat. \n\n&gt;She, the daughter of a farmer, is on her way to the city to meet the husband her father has arranged for her. The match is a loveless one, one designed to earn her safety rather than joy, but she has long ago accepted her role to build relations and create a foothold within the city. On her way to the city, though, her caravan escort is attacked, and her life will never be the same again.\n\nAs you can see, I love the idea of taking mythological creatures and incorporating them into rp, so if this is something that interests you and you have some sort of idea you want to try then just let me know! \n\nTo give some background on myself, I\u2019ve been writing for many, many years now (started way back with neopets!) and consider myself a literate writer. I usually post anywhere from 3-10 paragraphs per response, usually once-twice a day, and thrive on detail and character development. If you\u2019re looking for one-liners then I am not a good choice, sorry! The more detail you give me, the more I\u2019ll give you. I\u2019m fairly decent at mirroring, though, so if you tend to give 2-4 paragraphs then I\u2019ll happily stick around the same length. \n\nI post in third person past tense and would like my partners to do the same. Discord is highly preferred, since it keeps all of my rps in one place. If you absolutely cannot, will not use discord then I am open to using reddit or google docs.\n\nIf you don\u2019t feel the connection then don\u2019t worry about dropping me, I understand that finding the right partner can take some time. No hard feelings on my end :) Hope to hear from you (after all this!).",

            "selftext": "Genshin Impact's world of Teyvat is, in just a few words, massive in scope, rich in history and shrouded in a mystique that's waiting to be unraveled! We all know about the Traveler Siblings and how they first came to Teyvat, but what about the other characters we call our companions and build our teams with? They all have stories to be explored out of what the game shows us, and I for one think that exploring these characters, as well as Teyvat as a whole, could be quite fun and very rewarding!\n\nWhat I'm hoping to find is a partner who loves Genshin Impact as much as I do, and is willing to play Canon x Canon interactions as we both explore Teyvat and explore the relationships between the ample and rich cast of characters. I will admit that I'm a huge sucker for romance, but I'm willing to play any gender against any character that you want to play. If you'd like a list of characters, these are my favorites, and the ones with asterisks by them are the ones I'd be comfortable playing:\n\nDiluc*, Ayaka*, Jean*, Aether/Lumine*, Bennett*, Xingqiu, Hu Tao, Eula, Mona, Lisa, Amber, Fischl*, Keqing, Beidou*, Ningguang, Xiao, Ganyu, Rosaria, Venti\n\nBy all means, play who you want! I'm very much so down yo explore ships and crack ships galore as we explore Teyvat and make this world our own! Just please be 21+, as I'd prefer to play with someone closer to my age, and I do prefer Discord as my RP medium. Other than that, I'd love to brainstorm storm up a plot between our characters!\n\nHope to hear from you all soon! Thanks for your time!\n\nAd Astra Abyssosque",

            "selftext": "Heya, everyone.\n\nSo, I'm obviously looking anew for partners, at this time specifically in a little list of nerdy fandoms. However, if you're interested in original settings, feel free to check out my other post(s), as I'm also always recruiting for those and I might have a couple new plot bunnies!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. I'm looking for \"advanced/literate\" partners with as much love of the language as I have (know your possessives, \"your\" vs. \"you're,\" proper comma usage, etc.).\n2. I only do hetero pairings and am willing and able to double. In any of my \"looking for\" notes, it's assumed that unless you want to only play that character, I'm just asking to double.\n3. I'm not going to engage with you in what's mistakenly called \"mature\" content. Think PG-13 when RPing with me; I love romance and conflict, but don't get out of hand. I'm just not comfortable writing that kind of thing in a collaborative setting.  That said, I do require partners to be over 18, with 21+ preferred. I'm in my late 20s, so I'd rather stick with other adults.\n4. Email is preferred, but I can do others. Just ask.\n5. I don't do one-liners. Multi-para, please (unless the scene requires otherwise).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFandoms (**my** character in parentheses):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Tales of Symphonia (Raine) \\[Looking for someone to double as/take Regal.\\]\n* Star Trek: Voyager (Janeway) \\[Looking for a Chakotay.\\]\n* Harry Potter, Trio Era (OC teacher) \\[Looking for a Remus.\\]\n* Harry Potter, Marauders' Era (Same OC as a student) \\[Again, Remus.\\]\n* World of Warcraft \\[Prefer Wrath era, but will go up to Cataclysm if necessary.\\]\n* Fullmetal Alchemist (Riza) \\[Looking for a Roy.\\]\n* Fullmetal Alchemist Post-Series (Roy&amp;Riza's OC daughter)\n* Final Fantasy XIV:ARR\n* Final Fantasy X (Yuna?)\n* Final Fantasy XII (Ashe)\n* Fallout-verse \\[Have played NV, 4, and 76; working on 3.\\]\n\nAs I said, I'm also recruiting for original settings, including several fantasy prompts, sci-fi, paranormal, etc. Brainstorming and world building are welcome endeavors. We can even **discuss** fully OC renditions of the fandoms listed here; though my preference will always be to mix OC and canon or stick, in some cases, to mostly canon, if we come up with a really compelling idea, I could be persuaded.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo! If you're interested, please, *please*, use the PM function. I don't respond to comments.",

            "selftext": "Hello!\nToday I am in search of a literate (multi paragraph) RP partner who is into fandom RPs with canon characters.\nMy main genres are romance, drama, dark/twisted, adult/serious topics, horror and so on and so forth. Please only contact me if you are 18+, I am 19 and feel uncomfortable RPing with minors.\nUsually I am good at thinking of plots and I would be happy to discuss possible plots with you together, don\u2019t be scared to share your ideas, it does help me out a lot! :)\n\nSo now for the fandoms and who I can play:\nDeath Note:Light, Misa, Near, Mello | Killing Stalking: Bum | Ouran Highschool Host Club: Haruhi, Tamaki | Black Butler: Ciel (both), Sieglinde, Elizabeth, Alois, Maurice, Aleister Chamber |\n\nYes, I am open for all sorts of shippings (as long as they are legal), MxM and MxF (me) are preferred at the moment. \nIt would be great, if you used Discord, since I like writing there best. In my opinion the lay-out and design is pretty practical and easy to use. However we can also figure out something else. \nIf you are interested comment down below or shoot a message, I\u2019m rather desperate at this point because most of my fandoms have died out somehow and finding decent RP partners is tough :((( Don\u2019t be shy!\u2661",
