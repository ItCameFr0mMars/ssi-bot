I have a new rp idea I've been dying to dive into.\n\nEssentially the plot of this story would be a man struggling around a year and a half after the murder of his fiance. The idea would be that weird things begin happening to him and eventually after a while the ghost of his fiance appears and attempts to help him solve the mystery of who murdered her. (She doesn't know who did it either, she only remembers bits and pieces.)\n\nThis can go any way really, will he find a way to resurrect her after the mystery is solved? Will he find someone new along the way that helps him solve the case and fall for her? I'd love to talk out all the possibilities with you before we begin. Just let me know if you have any ideas you'd  like to add!\n\nI would also like for this to be a period rp if possible, maybe have it take place in victorian times or the 20's.\n\nIf you're interested please feel free to add me and shoot me a message!!\n\nI an 18+ and only looking for an 18+ partner and characters",

            "selftext": "Good day, stranger! I'm on the hunt for a long term partner, and friend, that'd like to shimmy on in and write with me. \n\n\nI'm looking for something in the world of My Hero Academia, but am more than happy to write in worlds like Fallout, Star Wars, Witcher or Destiny. Fandoms are not a necessity, either. I'd be entirely up for something that doesn't have a franchise attached to it, and is of our own design.  \n\n\nI've got a few ideas brewing around, for a few different approaches to my preferred world, which all tackle the middle ground of heroes to villains. Naturally, there IS a place between the goody two shoes and the evil schemers. Anti-hero, Vigilante, etc., etc. What I like about this area freedom, because you've got a lot of wiggle room, both for their past and their future. You don't need to stick to particular themes, and they bounce pretty well against both sides of the spectrum. And, they can go either way; become somebody \"better\", or somebody \"worse\". \n\n\nFor MHA, I've got a character I've recently whipped up, very bare bones, who's set themselves down a path of violence. They regret it, but don't know where to go. They fear their chance to return to where they came from, in terms of morality, has left. However, they yearn for the opportunity to become something more, something better. They are the maker of their own problems, and they understand this. Their return to decency would take some time, and definitely require a determined individual. They may want to change, but they're hard headed and stubborn. It's gonna take work. On the flipside, however, they're already pretty close to being recognized as \"bad guy\", and has absolutely broken several laws. Dozens, even. They'd be fairly easy to manipulate and drag further down; to turn into an actual nightmare. \n\n\nTropes, clich\u00e9s, and the such are more than welcome. In fact, I love them! They're extremely fun, even if they're simple and linear, for the most part. Ideas can be shallow, as long as the characters are not. Characters develop, too! I prefer to focus on those, over some major plot. A plot is astounding to have, but I don't like following a linear storyline that's predetermined. A general basis that's expanded on as the characters chug along is more fun to me, because there's an air of uncertainty; a lack of knowing what's to come. \n\n\nI am extremely accommodating, patient and very lenient. I'm not going to make you jump through a billion hoops, cause that's just silly! I do, however, kindly ask that you are patient with me, as I am with you, and capable of writing with proper grammar. I'm not going to ask you to text as if this is a book report, but I do quite enjoy well constructed posts. On that note, I'm not going to lay down a \"line minimum\". You write what you're happy with. As long as I'm getting something to work with, I'm happy. \n\n\nI use Discord, as that is my primary platform for all kinds of things! I'd be happy to slide it to you.",

We don\u2019t need to be literally people from the movie, in fact, I\u2019d prefer if we weren\u2019t, roleplays like that aren\u2019t my favorite, I like to be me. but it does take place in that universe and locations around the town. I don\u2019t know exactly if or how we can or will have the musical parts but I\u2019m definitely for it if you have some plan. \n\nNow about me: I have been roleplaying for several years, probably somewhere around 8 or 9 years total, pretty seriously for 5 or so. I\u2019m not extremely picky about length as long as you are competent and add to the story. In other words, it\u2019s not about quantity, it\u2019s about quality. I\u2019d rather have two lines or good, story moving, plot that 5 paragraphs of fluff that doesn\u2019t do anything. I use first person and ask that you do the same for simplicity sake. If  you have anymore questions, please ask.\n\nMessage me and we can discuss this more and get all the details locked in.",

Let me try to remember and write down everything people tend to write down in their own posts. I\u2019ve been roleplaying for awhile now, at least 7 years or so. I\u2019d prefer you to be fairly literate, but I\u2019m not gonna fault you for spelling words wrong here or there. I don\u2019t care *that* much.\n\nI\u2019d like to roleplay something with a certain goal, preferably. Even if it\u2019s a loose one, it\u2019s still a goal. It doesn\u2019t have to be known right away either and/or could just be personal goals of our characters. Basically, I\u2019m just looking for a scenario that isn\u2019t just minute to minute, day to day, mundane stuff where not much happens. Though that doesn\u2019t mean it has to be action packed.\n\nI listed my preferred style of scenarios in the title and I figured we could talk and work from those. If you\u2019re interested, please let me know! I also can talk via discord, if you\u2019d prefer that. Thanks for reading!",

I will keep this short and sweet but you can expect much more food for thought once you contact me (plot bones included).\n\n**word bank**\n\ncheap motels, cramped spaces, shady bars, incognito, on the run, on the road, hidden safe houses, playing cat and mouse, criminals, law enforcement, corruption, treason, espionage, more than meets the eye, romance, action, hurt and comfort, meaningful conversations, intimacy, tension, repressed feelings, masculinity, sacrifice, love and heartache\n\n**roleplay specs**\n\nI'm hoping to write with people who consider themselves to be on the advanced spectrum (which has nothing to do with length, again, more on that in PMs). Who can appreciate and offer accurate details, engaging dialogues, convincing characterization and an exciting storyline that becomes a playground for character development.\n\n**characters**\n\nThis roleplay will feature characters who are mostly **30+**, well rounded, flesh and blood humans who already have their place in this world. I want this story to rip them off their comfort zone and fling them into a spiral of tough decisions.\n\n**roles**\n\nIdeally, I will rp with just one person (who feels comfortable controlling multiple characters), with the main focus on **my partner's homicide detective or CIA agent or just a patrol cop** (male in 30s-40s) who will become entangled into the plotline along with **my character (who will supposedly be a criminal**, also male of similar age). I might consider swapping roles.\n\nIn case I am unable to find anyone interested in exploring the unessential subplots with me, **I will consider covering them with additional partners** whose main role could be one of the following: childhood best friend, female escort, random citizen, your role (if you have ideas, don't be shy).\n\n**outro**\n\nIf you're interested in ***collaborative*** **writing** with me and feel like we might be **compatible partners** I'll be happy to see you in my PMs, cheers.",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone! You can call me Jess (26F). I'm looking for a partner or two to play against my Fallout OC, Dahlia (Romance is expected). She's a cinnamon roll vaultie with a devious side and strange powers. A little bit more on her [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-vGBqN7PyK27PVFZST9RvAnkAQuj3nl4f6KRYUUA994/edit).\n\nDiscord only!\n\n**About Me:**   \nI consider myself a lazy lit rper. I *could* give you 10 paragraphs, and they'd be good paragraphs, but I don't really wanna. My post length tends to range from 1-3 paragraphs, depending on what's going on. I tend to post match my partner, and I can give a lot of detail, but I also wanna give my partner ample opportunity to respond and react! I post daily, and I promise to never ghost you and tell you if I'm not feeling the rp anymore. I'm very flexible and understanding of life coming up and would like the same from my partner. Most importantly, I am here to have fun! Jokes both in and out of character are expected and encouraged, and I love OOC chatter in general. On a side note, I will almost certainly draw fanart of our rp at some point.   \n\n\n**What I'm Looking For:**   \n\n\n* Someone 21+\n* Someone who replies frequently (at least a couple times per day. Usually. Getting busy is totally fine)\n* Romance!\n* Interesting OCs that can show my sheltered vaultie gal all the weirdness the wasteland has to offer. Doesn't even have to be based in canon! As long as it fits the aesthetic. \n* Someone OOC friendly and communicative \n* That's... all I can think of!  \n\n\nIf you read this far and are still interested, DM me with a description of your character and your favorite animal. :) Hope to hear from you soon!",

I do have a few requirements for any partners. I only use Discord, so please have one! I ask that you be 18+, and I ask that any roleplay we do includes romance, as I believe it greatly enhances the plot. Otherwise, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get along! \n\nFor the plots I had in mind, I\u2019ll start with the fantasy! I have a few characters in mind, but the specific plots I have in mind are rather general, so we can build upon them together! You can be whoever you\u2019d like in these roleplays, I\u2019d love for your character to be fully yours!\n\nA princess and her knight, a man who views the princess as weak and having never done work in her life.\n\nA young prince, on the run and in need of a guard.\n\nA man on a journey for revenge, joined by your character.\n\n\nNext, the fandoms! The fandom I\u2019m most interested in at the moment is DC, and I have a few canon characters I could play. I will say, I\u2019ve been dying for a story with Nightwing, so if that interests you, you\u2019ll immediately shoot to the top of the list! Some other fandoms I\u2019m interested in are:\n\nMarvel\n\nStar Wars\n\nLegend of Zelda\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2\n\nStardew Valley\n\nAnd that\u2019s about it!

The vibe, the mood, the films, the events. Huge Fan.\n\nThat being said I would love to set something up, with a partner centred around this time of year.\n\nWhilst it would not really *have* to be focused on All Hallows Eve, I would for sure like to have that as a background at a minimum \ud83d\ude0a\n\nSo \u2013 a little about me:\n\nI am a 20 something English gal, who works from home and has far to much time on my hands. I like to think that I am semi-lit, and prefer to create on Discord only please. I have been lucky to have had a couple of super great partners before, but for one reason or another, they are no longer around or have time for me. No hard feelings though.\n\nI am looking for a male partner, over +21, with similar interests. I am a fan of OOC, and would love to build a friendship with my partner to help with the chemistry that we create with our characters too.\n\nRomance is a must, but not the sole focus, and am totally up for discussing the plot and theme from start to finish with my partner. This is not to be a *every other paragraph is sex*, kind of deal. I want a story with backbone, not quickies!\n\nI have not written with someone in a while, but have RP\u2019d for almost 10 years, so don\u2019t let my dry spell put you off! Come and say hi!\n\n***Please do not send me a reddit chat request- Messages only, with Halloween somewhere in the title.***\n\nThanks \ud83d\ude0a",

I live in the central standard timezone in the US, and I work full-time.\n\nSo, my role is as follows:\n\nI recently moved to a small mountain town surrounded by a forest to get away from the bustling city. I interviewed for a position at the bakery in town, and I was thankfully accepted so I could move here. Unbeknownst to me, this town is full of werewolves and a few humans who help the pack that lives here. You're a member of this pack (the alpha, next in line to be alpha, etc.), and you've been tasked to make sure I'm not a threat to your pack, either as a rival werewolf or a hunter. However, I have a secret. Will you find out, or will it stay secret?\n\nSo, yeah, this is the slow burn idea! I was thinking your character would date mine, the whole idea of keep your friends close and your enemies closer. It wouldn't be a real attraction but over time it would become mutual. Maybe some action, some drama, secrets and lies revealed? I have a ton of ideas for this one.\n\nThe role is subject to minor changes, and I usually roleplay here on Reddit through the chat system. So, feel free to shoot me a chat request!",

            "selftext": "It is modern day and a tomb has been discovered in a nearby desert. Within the tomb is a labyrinth. Archeologists and explorers of all kind came to the tomb for its treasure. But unexpectedly there was a body, it was perfectly preserved, no rotting or decay. With a new type of technology scientists have been able to resurrect said body. After months of studies they have found out that the body was an old king named Janus Vitallion. He was brought up in a time of war and his knowledge of fighting and tactics remained with him. Scientists would test his physical abilities, but he would occasionally lash out injuring the scientists on hand. At the time of his death he was 19. Scientist came together and suggested that he would go to school. Time passes and it\u2019s his first day at your characters high school. How will things play out?\n\nAs in the previous paragraph my characters name is Janus Vitallion, he\u2019s a tall, about 6\u20196 and very fit with a body similar to Bruce Lee\u2019s. \n\nThe way I see this going is your character and mine end up becoming friends, your character teaches him about modern living and Janus provides stories of his time. \n\n\nMy name is Giovanni! I\u2019ve had this idea for a while and I\u2019m excited to see if anyone is interested in it! I don\u2019t care about writing length as long as your response holds water. I have a job so I\u2019ll respond whenever I\u2019m able too! \n\nPlease send a chat request or message me over Reddit if you\u2019re interested!!",

I will keep this short and sweet but you can expect much more food for thought once you contact me (plot bones included).\n\n**word bank**\n\ncheap motels, cramped spaces, shady bars, incognito, on the run, on the road, hidden safe houses, playing cat and mouse, criminals, law enforcement, corruption, treason, espionage, more than meets the eye, romance, action, hurt and comfort, meaningful conversations, intimacy, tension, repressed feelings, masculinity, sacrifice, love and heartache\n\n**roleplay specs**\n\nI'm hoping to write with people who consider themselves to be on the advanced spectrum (which has nothing to do with length, again, more on that in PMs). Who can appreciate and offer accurate details, engaging dialogues, convincing characterization and an exciting storyline that becomes a playground for character development.\n\n**characters**\n\nThis roleplay will feature characters who are mostly **30+**, well rounded, flesh and blood humans who already have their place in this world. I want this story to rip them off their comfort zone and fling them into a spiral of tough decisions.\n\n**roles**\n\nIdeally, I will rp with just one person (who feels comfortable controlling multiple characters), with the main focus on **my partner's homicide detective or CIA agent or just a patrol cop** (male in 30s-40s) who will become entangled into the plotline along with **my character (who will supposedly be a criminal**, also male of similar age). I might consider swapping roles.\n\nIn case I am unable to find anyone interested in exploring the unessential subplots with me, **I will consider covering them with additional partners** whose main role could be one of the following: childhood best friend, female escort, random citizen, your role (if you have ideas, don't be shy).\n\n**outro**\n\nIf you're interested in ***collaborative*** **writing** with me and feel like we might be **compatible partners** I'll be happy to see you in my PMs, cheers.",

            "selftext": "\nHello, It is a pleasure to meet whoever happens to be reading this I have been wanting to start out some new rps. So it though I'd give this a try, currently I have an assortment of five different plots that I've been dying to try out. The vast majority of them are fantasy based plot lines, given that's the kind of plot I frequent the most. A little about me before I get into the mist of things, I'm in my early 20s and run a little clothing shop. I have plenty off time on my hands posting wise I always try and match the length that my partner puts out. Usually 5-6 paragraphs I have been rping for a long while now, open commutation is very important to me. I fully understand stuff gets in the way, but I just prefer to be frequent is all. Helps build a stronger and better lasting bond and all of that. So please keep that in mind thank you:)\n\nNow then if that's settled lets get into the plots shall we, like I said beforehand I have five that I'd like to do here. So I'll just make sure to list them below, so you get a better grasp of what I'm talking about in this.\n\nThe first one surrounds Cassandra also commonly known in her world are the green witch originally she was a human. But with her many years of spell casting and babbling in all sorts of craft she transformed herself into something more beastly. Being mostly humanoid in nature, but a fair portion of her from the magic had been transformed and changed. She's a loner for the most part staying far away from any hints of civilization. Staying in an old cabin set in the middle of nowhere she spends most of her days studying and improving her craft. Being in isolation for such a long period of time it certainly has taken a tool on her mental state. This plot is based around her and her help a human male, she had posted posters around the kingdom seeking help and thankfully he answers the two spend the following months together. Her teaching him her ways we can talk more about this set one discussing further on plot points and ect\n\nDarwin is an old bot this plot is set in an ruined version of earth not many life forms were able to survive besides him. Well he isn't really alive, but yes he is capable of thoughts and improvement his father so called was an extremely intelligent man like most of the other humans. He wasn't able to last forever he spent the last of his days with his son. But eventually he passed leaving Darwin all alone given he didn't really have any other living soul to look after exactly so he spent his days searching the wasteland and abandoned cities. Straying away from mutants and other robots all of them seemed to have a simple mindset. Unthinking and not loving he was never able to find anyone to look after, until one foggy day. He had traveled further then normal traveling to an old ruined town to his surprise he discovered a human women. Her clothes in tatters and all bloodied hiding from the other bots thankfully enough she was passed out. But still had breath to her, so he picked her up taking her back to the base to look after her and so fourth.\n\nThirdly Fin a young siren who had lost her pod many months ago she spent the majority of her time with the fish. Though she slowly started to stray closer to humans, seeing all of the rubbish they had left over the years. But she never went to close to them, seeing what they've done to the ocean life taking up the fish. And setting all of them in nets taking them far above the surface, but unlucky enough for her she went to close one time. Wanting to see where are the fish happened to be heading towards. Just like that she was caught up in a humans fishnet an brought above the surface suddenly she was caught in the gaze of ten men. Consumed with greed of the money they would've been able to gather from her sell. She was then trapped in a large cage set in a zoo with all sorts of other creatures. Fin stayed away from man kind for most of the time, but one of the helpers caught her interest although they weren't able to do much given their job they looked after her.\n\nI have two more but we can talk more about those later if any of these plots are interesting to you shoot me a message I'd love to talk!:)",

            "selftext": "Hi! So! I'm going to try to not ramble and make this as succinct and casual as I can for my sake and yours. So hi! I wanna start by saying I'm non-binary since that seems to be a deal breaker for some, as well as I am over 18 and require my partner to be as well. Zero exceptions. Whether or not the element is in passing, I enjoy getting into the nit and grit of a character, even if it's just a back story tidbit that makes the character who they are or a new plot line to follow. I'm really just open to whatever happens because people are messy, and I like to write people that can be.\n\nSo, a bit more information while here. I write both male and female characters with no problems, but here today I have two plots I've been sitting on for a little while that are both m/m. Both have characters I've kinda worked on and picked at, but nothing is set in stone and they are flexible. I'd don't really mind who or what you are, but I greatly prefer other non-binary writers or those on the female side since I've personally had some bad experiences with men in the last few months or so. \n\nIdea wise, these things are basic and can definitely be worked on, but there are core ideas I would like to keep and mainly the character scraps I have for these, I'd really like to use. \nThe first one is simple so it can be built on easily. It's a simple romance between a ghost writer /producer and the artist that fronts for him /that he writes for. This can take so many different forms, but when I think of it I think very angsty. The character I have scraps for is also made with the possibility to be a supernatural being of some sort (something very natural and in tune with vibes and all since he,,, obviously writes music), so that element can be added in so easily. \nThe other one is very niche and while I don't like to touch Fandom things, there's a manhwa called Moonlight Garden I'd love to do a plot based on. By that I just mean keeping the core concept. It can be turned modern day or kept within the period it's written. **The bond between the characters is the focus first and foremost, exploring them together and their statuses in the society they are set in.** Of course I can go into more detail, but that's the main concept.\n\nI write on discord and try to aim for multiple paragraphs but I get that sometimes words don't come easy. As long as you give me something substantial to work with, I'm happy to work on it. I'd like to keep around the multiple paragraph area though. I also stick to 3rd person. As for reply speed, I'm fine if you take your time. I'd actually prefer that, as I find it hard to write every day as of late. And real life comes first. It would be ridiculous if it didn't. Of course I like to check in every now and then if I don't hear after awhile, and feel free to get on my butt about writing because if you're motivated and exciting, I probably will be as well. \n\nWell, I hope someone found something I'm here they could get excited about. And honestly, if you approach me with an idea you are excited enough about, I may take interest. But first and foremost I want to look for what I've been itching for a little bit. I hope to talk to yall soon :) this.... Went on much longer then I anticipated, my apologies",

            "selftext": "100 years ago Hyrule fell into the hands of Ganon and the Champion of princess Zelda was gravely hurt and had to be brought to the Shrine of resurrection to save his life.\nAfter an entire century he awoke from his slumber, it didn't take him very long to find the spirit of the King who, after making him do a few things for him, told him his true goal, to save me, Zelda, the princess of Hyrule and defeat Ganon.\nNow he has done it and Ganon was sealed once again, Zelda and Link are reunited and set off to help restore Hyrule to its former glory. \n\nWe've been hiking for quite a while, our plan was to go to the Zora's domain, Vah Ruta was having some problems and we made our way to it in order to fix it as well as talk to King Dorephan. At the beginning we rode our horses, so I mostly managed to keep up, but when we got closer to the domain, my new steed showed us that it wasn't quite fond of the water, so we left them at the closest stable and hiked.\nAfter just a few meters it was clear to me that I would have a hard time keeping up with Link and I even managed to for quite a while, but the longer we walked, the more and more I realized that after a century of keeping Ganon away from Hyrule, I was prone to getting tired quickly.\nI panted audibly, but said nothing and just did my best not to loose Link, after all there are monsters here after and I don't wish to be alone and defenseless if they decide to attack.\nAfter a while just couldn't walk anymore and had to stop, I took a deep breath and then said \"Ahh... Link could we pause for just a moment? You're too quick for me, I'm still having some trouble with my stamina.\" Before sitting down on the nearest rock. \n\n-------- \n\nHey there! I'm Lara and a huge fan of Zelda BoTW, after recently finishing it I realized that I just can't have enough of this beautiful game and ZeLink, so instead of waiting for the new game or reading some fanfictions I decided to create my own little thing with someone else. \n\nThis rp should be a longterm sort of action and adventure mix, we can tell the story as the two travel through Hyrule, help its people fight monsters and possibly even fall in love with each other. \n\nI consider myself quite literate but I'm probably not as literate as some of the people on here,\u00a0 but I still manage to put out quite long message, sometimes as long as around 3000-4000 characters. \nMy prefed platform is Discord, since I just live to chat ooc with my partner,\u00a0 but I will gladly settle with reddit too. \n\nA big thank you to everyone who read my entire post and I hope we'll find each other quickly!",

            "selftext": "Hello, reddit! I'm still lookin' for a pal to write some Five Nights at Freddy's with - OR something very similar.\n\nGeneral Info about me that might influence your decision to RP:\n\n**Lit** at least, please. I define \"Semi-Lit\" as being able to comfortably write at least two paragraphs per post. More detailed responses can go up to five or six paragraphs! And more laid-back and slow-paced moments can be two paragraphs. Just specifying to save a little time\n\n**I am 18+.**\n\n**Romance is secondary.** In fact, I usually don't plot romance, or focus on it as the main plot unless it happens naturally.\n\n**Discord for plotting**, please. We may write the RP anywhere, and can substitute Discord for another chat service if need be, but for general plotting I would *really need Discord* or something similar. PMs end up feeling too awkward and stifling to plot on.\n\nNumber # 1 warning: **I Ramble**. A lot, and if you're the same way, that's fantastic.\n\n**I Respect That Real Life Always Comes First.** If you are exhausted from work and/or school, ya don't have the energy to write or even think, then please don't feel pressured to respond. Whether we are chatting or RPing; I appreciate having your attention and focus, but I will never outright demand it of you.\n\nI really love themes involving found family, mysteries, angst, fluff, slice of life, and above all, *characters*. I want to hear you ramble on for ages about your characters and why they feel a certain way, and do the things they do. We can (and probably will) plot for hours about what we want to do and what we will put the characters through, but ultimately, it's the actions of the characters  that drives the story, and those actions can change based on how the character is treated. That's how important they are to me; they basically drive the plot.\n\nWhich is also why found family's intrigue me so much; I love exploring conflicts between characters that are dear to each other. Characters that otherwise may not have ever gotten along, yet are forced to be together through various extremely unusual circumstances (AKA, the animatronics; they were all built together, and had no choice but to exist alongside one another. Let's explore how that show went down!) - and genuinely do care for each other's  happiness, even if their definition of \"happiness\" is different from the other.\n\nOr characters that had no business ever knowing each other, yet despite all odds, become a family anyways.\n\n**What I generally like in FNAF -**\n\n\\- A**nimatronics are sentient machines, and their own beings independent of the human souls.** Exploring how they came to be sentient, how they interpret the world  around them, what their ultimate goals are and whether that conflicts or aligns with their \"programming\" (we're very lax in terms of technical  knowledge here). How they handle changes happening around them, how they deal with the staff, how they influence the restaurant (do they spend night time cleaning and organizing things, or even cooking stuff, or do they not care or are unable to do these things?), how they feel about entertaining patrons, etc etc etc.\n\n**Scenarios**\n\nJust a few scenarios I have in mind. We don't have to do 'em or follow them exactly, this is just a bed of idea's that I came up with to help us plot something in the beginning (your own plots and idea's are SO very welcome!!)\n\n\\-  The animatronic gang have always been sentient and alive since they were created - born as clueless machines at first that observed the world and learned. 40+ years pass in which they must endure being treated as unloved objects; even being taken apart and left for dead, only to be brought back unexpectedly. They take solace in whatever they can, from each other's company, to music, games, stories, or even taking out their frustrations on the Night Guards... But finally, the gang has had enough. They are determined to somehow free themselves from Faz Ent's shackles; but they might need to use a human's help in order to  get anywhere.... (A chance to re-write the animatronics biography however we please; meant to be more of a character study and filling in the missing details in their backstory's.)\n\n\\- One day, yet another innocent soul dies at a Freddy's location. But rather than moving on to whatever afterlife may exist, they find their soul is trapped within a machine - a discontinued knock-off brand of robots that had been thrown away and abandoned. They must navigate this new, terrible reality as a \"living\" animatornic - what makes things worse is that the other, much larger machines are alive, too. But it doesn't seem like they were ever human... (Human becomes an animatronic, meets the animatronic gang. Exploring the difference between a natural-born animatronic, and a human soul inhabiting an empty animatronic. How do they differ? Are they able to communicate? Help each other understand? Or is there too big a rift for a friendship to be formed, and instead they become enemies...?)\n\n\\- **Come join our family!!** A brand new Night Guard has arrived to a brand new, revamped version of Freddy  Fazbears! After the four main animatronics were strangely dismantled by  some break-in, they were rebuilt, and the building improved! Power troubles are a thing of the past! (Sorta... now it goes up to 300%! More than enough, right??) The building is so big that there are TWO security offices; Faz Ent might even consider hiring a second night guard someday! But as the Night Guard(s) learn adjust to their new job (while simultaneously dealing with the frequent challenges of day to day life), they start to learn quirks and secrets about the restaurant... Especially it's animatronics.\n\nEventually, the Guard(s) come to discover just how sentient the animatronics are. As the group become friends, the Night Guard(s) are totally oblivious to the dangers that \"friendly\" animatronics can bring....\n\nI would definitely like to play a Night Guard for this scenario, and we can also double up so we each have a night guard - maybe they're friends, maybe they're family, or maybe they end up tripping each other up! Having to survive animatronics alongside another person (friendly or foe) could be fun!\n\n\\- **Crazy new world.**\u00a0Character A and B are very close (friends, family, coworkers, blahblah) that get  along extremely well. Character A took the job of a Night Guard at  Freddy Fazbear's, and went missing after the fifth night. The staff at Freddy Fazbears claim that they never hired a Night Guard to begin with, and they're still desperately searching for someone to fill the position. Character B is distraught, and in an attempt to find Character A again, takes on the job at Freddy's to investigate. However, the  animatronics surprise everyone by speaking to him during his shift, advising that his friend had been waiting for him and they're eager to reunite the duo.\n\nBut first, they need a suit.\n\nMeant to explore being reborn as an animatronic alongside a friend. Great for world building, developing relationships, and family bonds/drama.",

Questions rang through her head day after day.\n\n\"I miss you.\" she whispered out at the ocean, turning away before breaking down into tears.\n\nBae Myeong is a twenty nine year old business worker, sick of her desk job and daily life. She felt run of the mill, nothing seemed special about her whatsoever. She just seemed ordinary, never telling anyone about herself, as she had seemed to be your typical introvert.\n\nAfter recently losing her partner in a violent car crash, she tries to come to terms with the pain she deals with on a daily basis, wondering if she needed a life change or if life itself was even worth it. She felt cheated, something out of her control ruining her entire life. Was it meant to be?\n\nThe woman that everyone knew and loved, had seemed to vanish from their lives as she fell into a deep deacy of depression, hiding herself from the world for months on end before finally returning to her job, just to realize that too is dragging her down.\n\nWhat does she need to get her back into the swing of things, and hopefully help her move on from the traumatic death of her fianc\u00e9.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHi! So this is a very rough sketch, and not an opener to a roleplay at all. It's just an idea I've been cooking up and would love to use this character and scenario. This a strict slice of life plot with hints of drama, real world issues, and mental health issues.\n\nIf this is something you might see yourself in being able to do, please send a message! I'd love to work with someone on this.\n\nJust basic rules beforehand:\n\n\\-Please be 18 or older.\n\n\\-Discord Preferably.\n\n\\-Be honest! If you wanna make changes or add your own ideas, please send them! I'm more than open ears.\n\nI hope to hear from you soon!",

I\u2019d prefer you to be fairly literate, but I\u2019m not gonna fault you for spelling words wrong here or there. I don\u2019t care *that* much.\n\nI\u2019d like to roleplay something with a certain goal, preferably. Even if it\u2019s a loose one, it\u2019s still a goal. It doesn\u2019t have to be known right away either and/or could just be personal goals of our characters. Basically, I\u2019m just looking for a scenario that isn\u2019t just minute to minute, day to day, mundane stuff where not much happens. Though that doesn\u2019t mean it has to be action packed.\n\nI listed my preferred style of scenarios in the title and I figured we could talk and work from those.

            "selftext": "Howdy everyone! My name is Xentren, and I'm on the hunt for some new partners to play out longterm scenes that revolve around fantasy, sci-fi, adventure, the usual mumbo jumbo. First off, a bit about me: I've been roleplaying for well over four years, I love to write, I absolutely adore a good story, I write anywhere from two to four paragraphs per turn, and I try to be as literate and descriptive as I can be (although obviously I'm not professional author). I consider myself to be pretty laid back about most things, so don't stress about trying to reply before some imaginary deadline! I will say, I'm not particularly looking for romance, but if you'd like to include it then I'm more than happy to!\n\nNow, here's what I'm looking for in a partner. I'm looking for someone who is literate, doesn't ghost for extended periods of time (I get it, life gets in the way, but please let me know if you're gonna be gone for a week or so), writes about as much as I do per turn (don't stress about matching me, just give me enough to go off of!), stuff like that!\n\nNow thats out of the way! Thanks for reading this far! I'm very open to playing a variety of scenes, so if the ones listed here dont interest you, I'm more than happy to offer some of the others I've cooked up, or hear some of yours! Of course, we could always make something entirely new! I love world building, so don't be afraid to tell me you don't like what I have and that you want changes! Also, don't be afraid to play something strange, like a goblin or a bizarre alien, I like strange! Alright, if any of what I've said interests you, then please send me a message and we can discuss it further! Anyways, here's my brief ideas:\n\n(1)The news spread as fast as the gaunt plague, perhaps even faster. A massive continent on the other side of the Endless Sea had been discovered by a group of hardy explorers. Or perhaps it was more appropriate to say \"rediscovered\", as countless ancient tales and prophecies referred to \"A land trapped at the edge of the world\" being the center piece to the fate of all who breathed. Of course, most folk were skeptical at best that this newfound territory held the key to the future. After all, it was just a piece of land. But after initial landing parties had reported sightings of crumbling ruins and bizarre creatures, coupled with more and more big-name companies founding and funding expeditions to the new world, skepticism had begun to fade into uncertainty. Not everyone wanted a piece of the glory, however, as countless individuals flocked to the new world not to find their dreams, but to escape their nightmares. Refugees, criminals, deserters, misfits, and so on had started true attempts at colonization. In these makeshift towns, it was well understood to not ask a stranger too many questions. With the new land only being uncovered a few months prior, it was astonishing how many had traveled there, and how high their bodies had begun to pile. Already, it was considered one of, if not the most dangerous place in the world.\n\n(2)The fires of war had been burning for three years now, with no end in sight. Young men and women of almost all races, from the largest cities to the smallest villages and holes were leaving their homes behind to fight for the glory of their country, the safety of their family, or the financial security of their future. Whatever their reasons, the result was always the same: they left home. With so many able-bodied hot-blooded individuals off fighting and dying in lands beyond the horizon, their homes were left more than a little vulnerable. In most cases, towns with populations numbering in the hundreds only had maybe five guards these days. While the king's war was with an imperialistic nation, his citizen's own war was being waged right in his backyard. Bandits were plentiful these days. Not only were the soldiers who once kept them in check now gone, but their ranks were now bolstered with deserters who passed their skills on to their new comrades. Unnatural creatures were now allowed to roam wild, as the numbers of adventurers and slayers continously fell. These days, many towns turned to hiring criminals to act as stand-in guards. Despite all these threats, however, there was one that caught the attention of a small, yet powerful group: Vampires. Their kind had supposedly been on the brink of extinction for centuries, thanks to this group's predecessor's efforts. Now, however, it may all have been in vain. The group, The White Torches, once numbered in the thousands, an armies worth of priceless vampire slayers. Now, they were barely sixty. With reports of vampires pouring in from every corner of the country, it seemed as though the fiendish nightwalkers weren't quite extinct, but were rather biding their time. Elderly vanishing from the streets, children disappearing from their rooms at night, there were countless reports. With the White Torches numbers spread so thin, they could only afford to send one fully fledged hunter on these missions. Occasionally, two would be sent, or perhaps even an apprentice, although an apprentice alone was almost always a death sentence. Still, with a war waging on for the country's future, some had to ensure their was still a country to come home to. (With this one, it can go several ways. A vampire/hunter duo, an apprentice hunter and their master, perhaps a hunter having to go out of their way to hire on an adventurer, whatever it may be!)",

            "selftext": "Hi! I'm looking for a longterm partner to do a slow burn werewolf based role. I consider myself to be a semi-literate writer and write least a paragraph most times, though I might find myself at a couple sentences. I never write one line responses. I write in first person, and usually in present tense. I'd like partner to be very similar! Also, I'd prefer my partner to be 22-26, as I am 22. I live in the central standard timezone in the US, and I work full-time.\n\nSo, my role is as follows:\n\nI recently moved to a small mountain town surrounded by a forest to get away from the bustling city. I interviewed for a position at the bakery in town, and I was thankfully accepted so I could move here. Unbeknownst to me, this town is full of werewolves and a few humans who help the pack that lives here. You're a member of this pack (the alpha, next in line to be alpha, etc.), and you've been tasked to make sure I'm not a threat to your pack, either as a rival werewolf or a hunter. However, I have a secret. Will you find out, or will it stay secret?\n\nSo, yeah, this is the slow burn idea! I was thinking your character would date mine, the whole idea of keep your friends close and your enemies closer. It wouldn't be a real attraction but over time it would become mutual. Maybe some action, some drama, secrets and lies revealed? I have a ton of ideas for this one.\n\nThe role is subject to minor changes, and I usually roleplay here on Reddit through the chat system. So, feel free to shoot me a chat request!",

            "selftext": "Hey Reddit! I love RPing and trying different/unique scenarios or good old reliable themes I am awaiting for your ideas. My character is a universe traveler who has superpowers. But will she use them or not, how strong will she be will all depend on your ideas! If your character is a cosmic being and our adventure circles around supernatural beings she'll be using her powers or we can just do good old magic RP/ detective/ secret agent/fandom so she'll be fitting that scenario as well. There isnt an idea called bad idea in my opinion so feel free to hit me up any ideas you have! You dont have to have full prompt or whole story set, I like worldbuilding with my partner ad well so even slightest theme would work for me just fine! If you dont have any idea but wanna do RP feel free to hit me up as well, I got a few ideas on me too \\^\\^\n\nIm also up to play male for my female partners as well, though I'd love to use my OC.\n\nWhat does this means to you: I can literally play any scenario you want (hopefully). \n\nEven though Im used to playing around either space adventures or medievel stuff I'd love to explore other subjects as well! So please dont be shy!\n\nFandoms I know: DC, Marvel, Jojo and more!\n\nAnd just a few notes, I would love if my partner would be over 18 and will have experience on RPing. Im looking for either long or short term RP. I also request to make longer sentences, my latest partners has been having hard time writing sentences more than 3 words. So you probably know how I feel :D And about storybuilding please contribute to story as well! 50/50 contribution between you and me can make both of us enjoy the game as we progress!\n\nIm waiting for your interesting ideas in my DM!\n\nMy character's backstory if anyone's interested:\n\n \"I've lost my mother when I was a youngling. She's under a tree all I know. My father my young times all are faded memories for me. Stars have chosen me as their guardian. Giving me flying ability in even space like a star and universe traveling for some reason... I learnt I could travel between universes when I was 5. By accidentally moving to another universe and losing my main one, forever... I was so little, I was so scared. Kids that got lost at shopping malls scares by heart, very deeply but for me I lost my main universe. So I did what every lost child would do, find my mother and father back. I've learnt later I travel to random universes so there was no way back home. But as a kid it wasn't an option. So traveled and traveled through universes. Over and over, over and over, over and over, over and over. Until I realized there's no way back home.\"",

            "selftext": " \n\nBefore we get into everything, a bit about me. Hello there, you can call me Seraphim, or deer for short! I'm 21, go by they/its pronouns and just created a new Reddit account after quite a while of dormancy. I've been in the RP business for about 6 years now, and it's one of my favourite pastimes that I'd love to get back into! I live in Canada and am in the EST Timezone.\n\nas of right now, I'm looking for a fun, canon divergent Marvel roleplay with my favourite character, spiderman (whom I would like to play). I'm looking for someone to main a canon character, hopefully, one of the avengers. Tony Stark, Steve Rodgers, Bucky Barnes, Natasha Romanoff, Docter strange or Bruce Banner most notably.  \nI do have some pre-written plots, but those are more or less there in case you don't have any ideas. I am more than willing to talk and RP with you, regardless of whether my plots intrigued you or not.\n\nRP Requirements:\n\n\\- Please be Semi Literate too literate! if I only get a few sentences per reply, I will lose interest quickly. Try to write at least one 5-8 sentence paragraph minimum.\n\n\\- Quality over quantity, always. if you write super long, I have no problem waiting for a good reply from you! as long as you can bring me 1-2 replies per week, I am completely happy.\n\n\\- Talk to me; communication is key when writing together. I want to be able to discuss plots and ideas and headcanons, and just have fun with you in general! I need that discussion.\n\n(not mandatory) - and finally, I have a very, *very* bad memory. if I don't reply for a few days, it would be nice to have someone who is able to just give me a quick tap on the shoulder to make sure I'm keeping up to the pace YOU want.\n\nannnnnnd, onto the plots. just for the record, these are all staged before the events of infinity war, or in a reality where those events never took place.\n\n\\#1 -- Peter Parker, now a young adult in his early 20s, is officially invited onto the avenger's team. he moves out of aunt may's apartment into the avenger's tower, and has to adjust to living with the avengers and all that comes with it.\n\n\\#2 -- Aunt May passes in an \"awful accident\" while Peter is at school. Peter is removed from the scene after she is discovered and the police are called. With no one else to turn to, Peter seeks assistance from (insert character here). To avoid being placed in a foster home, Peter is placed under the legal guardianship of (insert character here).\n\n\\#3 -- Peter Stark, Tony Stark's first and only kid, is a young prodigy. he was bitten by the spider when he was a child, and it is now Tony's responsibility to raise his now 16-year-old spider son, all while trying to keep Peter's talents hidden from the world and the other Avengers, and out of the path of his numerous adversaries.\n\n\\#4 -- it's Summer break for peter parker, and he's ready to have lots of fun. the only problem? no one to have fun with. his friends are on vacation and his aunt is working all day. so what is the teenager to do? well, find someone else to drag along of course. your character is that person. mostly just fluff and fun shenanigans, not too plot-heavy.\n\nso yeah, that's it! please feel free to message me if you're interested. I can give you my discord stuff there :)",

I\u2019ve been roleplaying for about 6-7 years, and I can write as much or as little as the story needs. The only preferences I have for partners are that they\u2019re 18+ and enjoy writing and being descriptive. As for topics, I\u2019m interested in a lot! Fandom, SOL, fantasy, adventure, action, etc. The fandom roles I\u2019m most interested in right now are ATLA, Marvel, and Percy Jackson for fandoms, but I would love to discuss some more basic romance roles as well. Send me a message with a little intro and what you\u2019re interested in if you\u2019d like to discuss some more!",

She has to deal with the perils of being a woman in  these times (1960's) - the constant disapproval, the leering men, and so on. She meets a young man during a championship match. Their first meeting is horrid and they become intense rivals. The secret is that this young man is a woman as well.*\n\nSo there's my plot bunny.\n\nI'm looking for a roleplay where this relationship isn't cutesy or like fluff. I want the slow-burn tension that balances on pure loathing and respect. I want them to loathe each other in the beginning because enemies to lovers is my favorite trope! I want both of them to have baggage but ultimately I do like my RPs to end rather bittersweet (no tragic deaths guaranteed) ! I would like to play the woman dressing as a man.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I'm 27 and would like to RP with someone my age bracket. \n* I am looking for someone who will write 3-5 paragraphs in 3rd person. I might ask for a sample.\n* I also hate ghosting. I don't care if you want to drop the RP but just tell me!

Hopefully doing well during these crazy times.\n\nI've  been roleplaying since I was twelve ( on and off) and I'm officially back to roleplaying now after a big break. I'm detailed and literate, patient as well. I usually try to get at least one reply per day though it may be way more than that if I can/if I'm into the role. I'm currently  working but still have free time and I'll always let you know if for whatever reason I'll be slower or I can't continue the role, you can be sincere as well.\n\nMy style is... Any. I can adapt to your preference. I've done both first and third  person and present and past tense, your choice. I'm not native but my  grammar is decent and I'm always looking for ways to improve my  vocabulary and such, which is one of the reasons why I roleplay. I need you to have good grammar as well so I can learn and improve with you.\n\nMy  plots usually start as both of our characters being strangers. I like a  slow build-up. I'm not really into fantasy or sci-fi as I prefer  realistic roles. I love drama and romance, some action as well. We can  discuss! Preferably our characters will be in their late twenties or  early thirties ( forties if you want). I'm currently looking for someone  to do a The Handmaid's tale roleplay with me, but if you have any plot  or would rather brainstorm together you're welcome to message me!\n\nLastly,  I think it's obvious but I will only roleplay with women. If you're a  guy who can play a female character, that's awesome but you're not the  person I'm looking for so please, don't ask. I'm sure there's someone  else out there looking for you :)\n\nBasically I'm a 23f les looking for a 18+ F. Please be experienced and detailed.\n\n If you're interested, message me! \n\nThanks for reading, have a lovely day!",

I like a lot of different fandoms, so feel free to ask if you're interested in something not listed. I like to roleplay out a fair amount of action, with a nice plot to go with it. It can also be nice to have a romance subplot thrown in for some extra plot and character development. In terms of characters, I prefer to use OCs, as I find it to be more fun and easier in general to RP with an OC. I intend to include some more dark and mature elements, So I hope that you are okay with that. Listed below are some ideas for the fandom, just pm me if you're interested!\n\nTokyo Ghoul\n\nPsycho Pass\n\nAkame ga Kill\n\nClaymore\n\nYoujo Senki\n\nAbove is just a very small list. I have an interest in a wide number of fandoms, so if you have any particular fandom that you're looking for just let me know and we can talk about it. I hope to hear from you soon!",

I roleplay in description form in 3rd person, and I would prefer if you are able to write a good paragraph\n2. Whether you are playing an oc or a canon character, please be able to play as more than one character as well\n3. There can be doubling if you want to\n4. If   you want romance for your character, that's totally fine. I will ask for any relationship with my character to be completely platonic\n5. I would really prefer if you have a really good idea as to how the canon characters act in general\n6. I DO NOT do fandom roleplays with just our oc's! I want canon characters involved too please!\n7. I  would prefer if you would reply at least once a day, but if there's anything going on, then that's fine. Though I will check in if it's been  a while that you replied\n8. If there's ANY trouble, please tell me first before considering ghosting\n\nSomething else you should know is that while I roleplay with an oc, I won't  focus  on them the entire roleplay. I really enjoy exploring the canon characters. So, for example, while my oc may be away, that won't be an automatic time skip since I'm gonna start playing as a canon character\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHere are some plots we can go by\n\n* \ud83c\udf11Connection\ud83c\udf11: Rumor has it that my character's guardian was close friends with the Una Family, which eventually catches the attention of the others, especially La Squadra\n* \ud83c\udfb6The New Member\ud83c\udfb6: My character becomes the newest member of La Squadra whether she likes it or not (This will take place a year or so before  the events of Part 5)\n* \ud83c\udf38A New Friend\ud83c\udf38: My character is a member of La Squadra and becomes friends with a member of Team Bucciarati\n   * This can be connected to The New Member\n\nI mostly put in ideas for my character because I want you to be able to come up with something for your character, if you happen to have one. If   you happen to have any ideas for your own character or for the story in general, I would love to hear about it\n\nI will request that it takes place somewhere before the actual events of  Part 5 as I want the characters involved to be able to interact with each other and stuff\n\nLike seriously for the thing above, I REALLY want to be able to have the canon characters interact. Like let's have them interact, bond, and allow them to have inner dialogue on how they feel about certain    situations, just stuff like that, okay?\n\nWe  can talk about how we want things to go, like what we want to happen to  the characters in the  roleplay, and other stuff like that",

We're two alt kids with no interest in the rest of the world and spend most of our free time uncomfortably close to each other.

I don\u2019t have many requirements, though I do have a couple of things thatre dealbreakers.\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\n-Please send over 2 paragraphs.  If you aren\u2019t feeling a scene, I totally get it, but just give me enough to work with, and i\u2019ll do the same.\n\n-Move the plot forward!!! We both have control of the direction of the plot in this RP, so always feel free to put in your two cents, OOC or in rp!\n\n-Don\u2019t be weird.  Just don\u2019t.  We both don\u2019t have enough time to deal with it, so just keep it out of OOC and rp.\n\n-If you ever feel like you\u2019re not gonna be able to reply, please give me a heads up! I\u2019ll do the same with you, communication is key!\n\n-Finally, i\u2019d prefer that my partners be over the age of 18.  \n\n\nBASIC PLOT\n\nSometime in the near-future. \u2018The Republic\u2019.\n\nWhere California once stood, now rested \u2018The Republic\u2019, a conglomerate of city-states which work with and lay down laws for their large expanse of territory.  While many of these city-states are centered around a certain area of expertise, such as fishing or business, they all participate in \u2018The Company Games\u2019, an annual event where each city-states top fighters come together to battle for glory, honor, fame, and a concerning amount of money.\n\nThough, becoming a part of \u2018The Company Games\u2019 isn\u2019t a walk in the park.  First, any wannabe competitors have to be signed onto a squadron, and even then, prove themselves against their city-states *other* squadrons.  It\u2019s a drawn-out, extremely difficult process, that costs participants money, time, and most importantly, sanity. Though, it\u2019s all a small price for money, right?\n\nSUMMARY\n\nWhat i\u2019m looking for is something not too dissimilar to No More Heroes, though with more of a shonen/tournament sort of story throughout.  Our characters starting off as rookies, pinching pennies and doing whatever they can to be noticed by an organization, while slowly fighting their way up to the top in order to achieve stardom, or get some money in their pockets.  Of course, they\u2019d met a cast of characters throughout, and have their own seperate goals, though their main objective would be to reach to the top of the so-called corporate ladder!\n\nTLDR;, something similar to No More Heroes, but with a heavy urban sci-fi twist.\n\nA message is the best way to reach me, thanks!",

            "selftext": "Hey! How's your day going? I just watched James Bond's new movie and ehhh I didnt really like it. Though I LOVED Casino Royale, it was awesome! \nAnyways before RP ideas wanna clear out a few stuff: \n\n1) My partners have to be female playing a female and must be over 18 if we ever decide to add something spicy. \n\n2) I want my partner to write 1-3 paragraphs or even longer I wont mind! But shorter is a big nono. I want a \npartner who'll contribute to story like I do and not just wr\u0131te short messages \nand leaving me to progress the story by \nmyself. \n\n3) Unnecessary to say but I want her to have decent experience on RPing as wel same reason with second. \n\nok now we've left the boring stuff outta way lets move to fun ones! Here's my ideas and again if you feel like you have something on your mind and fit the needs feel free to DM me! \n\nA) My OC x Poison IVY: The earth was conquered by Gorilla Grodd and her device that controls minds. (Tbh I like grodd and he's kinda underrated ngl) He've successfully took control of every human's will at his head with no effort. Including Young Justice, Justice League, Justice League Dark etc etc. But our characters will be the ones to get unaffected from the radiation (maybe cheetah as well but who cares about her lmao). Normally Ivy wouldn't care about such occurance but Grodd is taking all plant life form around the earth either for materials and for other reasons. It'll be our job to take down all villians and heroes to get rid of Grodd once and for all.\n\nB) My OC x Captain Marvel (not Shazam): This one comes from marvel universe. Same mind manipulatoon stuff but this time Thanos or any main villian controlling every mind using the infinity stones for everyone to obey. My OC and Captain Marvel (they're VERY similar characters) will reach their way to end villian by killing every marvel hero and villian on their way to stop the main villian once and for all.\n\nC) My OC x Wonder Woman slaughtering Greek gods (and other gods afterwards maybe) in sake of revenge. Becoming a villian and turning against the world, killing DC heroes and villians. Maybe even going on to space to attack green lanterns or New Gods.\n\nI mean you see what I want. FxF, we being strong characters and a lot of actions, fighting and worldbuilding! If you vibe with that and have similar ideas I can probably vibe with you, even with medievel stuff. Just HMU I dont bite!",

            "selftext": "Hello there, Kari here. 29F, writes M, specifically Crow from the Destiny video game series.\n\nI do M/M romances only, but I'm open to non-romantic plots as well. (18+ for both characters and partners please.) Canon characters preferred, but feel free to hit me up with your OCs if you'd like. I'm open minded, especially (but not exclusively) with regards to aliens.\n\nI tend to write third person multi-paragraph, somewhere around the discord character limit, and would love if you did too. I'm a sucker for romance and adventure, open to both AUs and canon storylines.\n\nI'd like to explore Crow and/or Uldren a bit, whether it's from the current storyline or something alternate. Would *love* to find someone who writes Spider or Drifter especially, but any Destiny writers are welcome to contact me, honestly.\n\nPossible ideas:\n- What if Pulled Pork met Uldren and chose him as a Guardian? Would Uldren ever agree? Would Forsaken play out as it did?)\n- Literally just Crow trying to interact with anyone. That's it, that's the premise.\n\nDMs are open if you're interested, I'm probably down for just about anything.",

I\u2019m in EST, but I\u2019m fine with roleplaying with anyone, as long as you don\u2019t mind the time difference.\n\nI\u2019m looking for anyone to roleplay anything, really. I\u2019ve been really in the mood recently for something cyberpunk-esque, but if that\u2019s not your thing or you\u2019re just not in the mood for that right now, please let me know what you are interested in! I\u2019ll roleplay pretty much anything as long as I think it\u2019s interesting enough.\n\nIm not sure I have much else to say other than I don\u2019t require you to be extremely literate or to always type out a novella. Just do your best and I\u2019ll do the same. I like to roleplay in 1st person as well, but if you prefer 3rd, I can do that instead. I also tend to like to play myself or some variation of myself since I find it extremely difficult to really connect to my character if I have nothing whatsoever in common with them.\n\nAnyway, if you\u2019re at all interested, please let me know! Thanks! I hope to hear from you soon!",

I don\u2019t have many rules just a few simple ones. First no one liners, I dread when people do that it\u2019s so unbelievably hard to work with. I normally tend to put out more then 3 paragraphs although this mostly differs on my partners responses I like to write around the same length. Now for the second and last one no ghosting, I completely understand real life comes first if you get disinterested that\u2019s fine! Just shoot me a message. Now that is it onto details the types of rps that I play out the most, are fantasy and action. I\u2019m not sure what it is about it. That draws me so into these worlds, it\u2019s just so fun to get lost in them I love it. For timing I try to put out as many replies as I can I\u2019ll give you a heads up if I\u2019m busy. Since Covid I have been working from home, so that gives me a bit more free time on my hands. As for platforms I tend to only use discord though if you\u2019d like we can definitely talk about the plot and what not through here! Now I do think that\u2019s about it? Of course we\u2019ll talk through all the details and hopefully make a story together! Just shoot me a message bye bye now!",

            "selftext": "Looking for literate writers. I write third person, past tense. I also double - almost require it at this point. Meaning, you play a canon character for me and I'll do the same for you (these are all canon/oc pairings). Also write anywhere from 4-6(+) paragraphs per character. I also don't mind playing a lot NPCs for the story and would appreciate someone who felt the same and didn't mind taking that initiative. I don't have much in the way of triggers/limitations; please inform me if you do. And I can usually mange at least a post a day - if not more if I'm feeling particularly inspired. I'm over 21 and would prefer a partner the same or at the very least, 18+ Also, I feel like I shouldn't have to mention, but unfortunately, I do: please don't make any decisions or control my character in any way. NPCs are fine, however. And please brainstorm and help develop the story along with me. \n\nCurrently craving a Critical Role RP. I'm game for either campaign. From campaign 1, I'm looking for Vax or Grog and from Campaign 2 Caleb or Fjord (maybe just Liam or Travis, ahaha). And if you'd like to double, I can write as anyone from either, so just lemme know who you'd like.  \n\n\nPM me if interested and we can exchange deets; I prefer discord or email.",

            "selftext": "Hey! How's your day going? I am playing Guild Wars 2 as usual, man what a cool game!\n\nAnyways before RP ideas wanna clear out a few stuff: \n\n1) If you ever get bored of RP and wanna leave please dont ghost me :(\n\n2) I want my partner to write 1-3 paragraphs or even longer I wont mind! But shorter is a big nono. I want a partner who'll contribute to story like I do and not just wr\u0131te short messages and leaving me to progress the story by myself. \n\n3) Unnecessary to say but I want her to have decent experience on RPing as well same reason with second. \n\n4) If my partner is a female we can discuss about romance but if is a male, romance or whatsoever wont be in. Still 18+ partners please!\n\nok now we've left the boring stuff outta way lets move to fun ones! You can either bring your OC or play as canon character fitting to story. Here's my ideas and again if you feel like you have something on your mind and fit the needs feel free to DM me! \n\nA) Poison IVY: The earth was conquered by Gorilla Grodd and her device that controls minds. (Tbh I like grodd and he's kinda underrated ngl) He've successfully took control of every human's will at his head with no effort. Including Young Justice, Justice League, Justice League Dark etc etc. But our characters will be the ones to get unaffected from the radiation (maybe cheetah as well but who cares about her lmao). Normally Ivy wouldn't care about such occurance but Grodd is taking all plant life form around the earth either for materials and for other reasons. It'll be our job to take down all villians and heroes to get rid of Grodd once and for all.\n\nB) Captain Marvel (not Shazam): This one comes from marvel universe. Same mind manipulatoon stuff but this time Thanos or any main villian controlling every mind using the infinity stones for everyone to obey. My OC and Captain Marvel (they're VERY similar characters) will reach their way to end villian by killing every marvel hero and villian on their way to stop the main villian once and for all. (I crave for this.)\n\nC) Wonder Woman slaughtering Greek gods (and other gods afterwards maybe) in sake of revenge. Becoming a villian and turning against the world, killing DC heroes and villians. Maybe even going on to space to attack green lanterns or New Gods.",

            "selftext": "Greetings! The transition from summer to autumn has me seeking somewhat seasonal, specifically non-fandom plots. Some themes I'm currently interested in, but aren't essential to all the ideas, include suspense, mystery, scandals, depression, paranoia, romance, obsession, the paranormal, horror, action and adventure. Now with all of that said, here's some potential plot ideas.\n\n**Hellish Honeymoon [Summer]:** Our characters are newlyweds, having just arrived at the beautiful island they'll be staying on for their honeymoon. On the top of the world, they're prepared to relax and let loose away from their day to day lives. But soon they'll realize they made a grave mistake, finding themselves struggling to survive and escape the island with their lives.\n\n**The Dead Come Out at Night [Autumn]:** It happens every autumn, every night of October. The dead rise... or maybe they're released? Perhaps people are giving a virus that turns them? There's plenty of conspiracies, all of which are explored and expressed year around. But what's for sure is that from the night of October 1st to the morning of November 1st, it's a zombie apocalypse every single night.\n\n**Murder Mountain [Winter]:** A recent tragedy and an inherited cabin was what led to our characters taking the sudden trip to Sycamore Summit. Whether they're strangers, friends or significant others, it's a couple weeks before Christmas when they decided to escape the things plaguing them. Meanwhile oblivious to the reason why the locals (that are left) don't frequent the mountain and surrounding forests.\n\n**A [Spring] Break Situation:** So for this one, I don't have an established idea like with the others. But some possibilities include an accidental murder, an unintentional yet detrimental one night stand/long term affair or something along the lines of being transported to a different dimension or time period. All of which, ideally have with our characters being college students on their spring break vacation.\n\nLast but not least, I write in past tense from a third person point of view. My replies tend to be anywhere from two to four paragraphs, but it all depends on what's going down in the current scene. Also, response time isn't an huge deal as long as reasonable transparency is established. \n\nThat's pretty much all I have for now. So feel free to reach out through Reddit DMs or Reddit Chat with any inquiries, expressions of interest or questions you may have.",

A friend who plans to join my character or maybe a current adventurer who helps out the adventurer guild they are heading to. Whoever you may be an long adventure is waiting to unfold \n\n----\n\nI hope you are interested in this idea. I'd like to state a few things about this. \n\nRomance is optional for this and not required. We can discuss this further in PM\n\nOur characters can be either gender and know that all characters don't need to be limited to being human so feel free to be imaginative :)\n\nWhen messaging please provide a ref along with a name as well as how they will fight be it magic, a weapon or both or some other way. Maybe they don't fight at all, the choice is yours\n\nThat's all I need to let you know. If you are interested please message me and we can discuss further. I can use discord or telegram",

            "selftext": "Hello! Since it\u2019s October I thought it would be fun to start a more Halloween themed role play.  My idea is a group of friends (perhaps 3 or 4)spend a weekend at my character\u2019s family lake house which is in a pretty remote location.  It\u2019s a spot this group of friends have been to many times, but this weekend is different.  During the first night one (or two) of the friends vanishes.  It becomes clear then that someone\u2014or something is out here with us.  Our characters have to work together to survive, find our friends, and hopefully escape. \n\n\nAs for our characters\u2014it can be an established relationship, slow burn, or just friends.  I have no preference on that! It\u2019s whatever character you want to make! I\u2019m also open to brainstorm any ideas you have! \n\nI am 20+ and would prefer you be as well.  I write in 3rd person and in several paragraphs.  I do work full-time but can respond once or more a day.  \n\nIf you are interested just spend me a chat.  Thanks! :)",

            "selftext": "Hi there. Don't know if it's spooky season that's making me want to advertise this or if I've just been wanting to roleplay them for a long time, but I'm going to name a few survival horror game RP inspirations and see if anyone is interested in writing them with!\n\nMy main want is Silent Hill, where I'm looking for a partner who is interested in writing the slowburn psychological and interesting horror worldbuilding aspects of the series. I assume setting an original story in the Silent Hill universe or creating our own plot with a concept similar to the SH otherworld would make the most sense, but if you are specifically interested in a canon story, I would not be against it if we can come up with something that makes sense and is lore consistent. Or not lore consistent. Sometimes I just wanna have fun and I am particularly fond of playing Heather Mason.\n\nMy next want would be Fatal Frame and unlike the Silent Hill option, I'd prefer this one to be completely OC focused because the Fatal Frame world and characters within it is just a bit too all over the place for me. I'm thinking this would be a paranormal horror roleplay with a similar premise and even in the same universe as Fatal Frame, where we would play as characters exploring an extremely cursed location with the same sort of mysteries to solve, cameras to photograph ghosts with, and somewhat campy mood of the series.\n\nAnd finally, I name this last because I feel like it is the most popular option for roleplay... Resident Evil. Since RE8 came out though, pretty much all people ask for when I bring the series up is Lady D roleplays and although I love the woman, I would like to keep this limited to RE1, RE2, RE3 , and RE7 roleplays. Or non-canon related whatsoever, because there is quite a big world to explore in that game. I am more fond of the straightforward zombie/monster survival. horror elements of the first three games and is what I'd like to explore the most if this is your choice. If you are set on canon characters, I oftentimes play Jill Valentine or Ada.\n\nAnd that's all I have to write for now! If you are interested, please send me a message rather than commenting on the post. It is the only way I'll respond. Thanks for reading my ad and I hope to play with some of you!",

The pheromones make them irresistible to each other, leading to things getting serious quick. We can also introduce a villain to add some action to the roleplay if you so please.\n\nThat\u2019s about it, we can discuss more details in PMs. Please be 18+ (because I do want to get into *that* kind of stuff, obviously it won\u2019t be the main focus though) and be able to write one or more paragraphs.

I can write less, but nothing close to one liners or a few lines. I like to be creative with my responses. \n\n- I love to chat out of rp! Got some fanart? Send it over. A song that reminds you of the rp? Let me hear it! Pets? Lemme see- I\u2019m all for becoming friends. This in mind I often do long term rp. \n\n-For symbrock I\u2019d prefer to be Eddie but can play either for Eddie x Peter B if you are dying to play a certain character. \n\n-As plot goes I\u2019d love to throw ideas around, though please avoid spoilers for the new venom movie as it\u2019s not out here yet and I\u2019m desperate to watch it.\n\nIf interested please contact me and I\u2019ll send my discord over.",

I am really hoping for a super powered one but i can be flexible!\n\nVery open to ideas and would love to world build together! If not I have a few too! obvious ones are human from todays world is sucked into a game (for whatever reason) and then tries to figure it out. I have a few set ups for that kind of thing. Since the setting is flexible we can hammer out details when we chat prior to starting. \n\nNote I am not looking for anything dark. Something light and fun!! \n\nI only play on discrd and am really hoping for long term. I am available basically every day and can respond multiple times a day, but no pressure. I usually aim for 2-3 paragraphs but depending on frequency of responses we can do smaller, faster responses or larger slower ones. \n\nI'm going to sneak this in here too. Password is key. Don't use it in the subject. Extra points for a message and not a chat. And especially not a comment. And if you're into something a little spicy check out my profile. \n\nI am usually a GM so I am more than happy to help and make this as easy as possible for you. I am also open to playing multiple characters as I mentioned above!\n\nI write paragraphs and first or third person. I love details and dialogue!\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you!",
