My name is Mags, I\u2019m a 21-year-old female roleplayer from the Central Standard Time zone, and I love exploring characters! \n\nI usually am incredibly intrigued with delving into modern real life, but recently I\u2019ve been wanting to create a universe, preferably one more or less in the English Renaissance era. I think it would be fun to create a royal family, and explore storylines between those members and the townspeople. Nothing overly drastic in regard to politics or war, but just living in the lives of these humans and the angst and emotions that radiate between them. \n\nIf this kind of seems like your cup of tea, I hope you reach out! Some of my personal guidelines are: \n\n- You are 18+ years of age. \n- You are comfortable writing via Discord. \n- You like writing in the style of slice of life. \n- You are a literate writer. \n- BONUS: You like creating mood-boards and playlists. \n\nI know this is pretty vague of an advertisement, but I hope that brings you joy in that we can work together to make decisions! Have a wonderful rest of your day, and let\u2019s talk soon. :) \n\n- M.",

            "selftext": "Hello Everyone,\n\nThank you for stopping by!\n\nJust a little about myself, I'm a 21+ male writer from the UK (GMT Timezone), I have just over 7 years of experience in the world of roleplay and I'm currently looking for a roleplay partner that equally shares a passion in roleplaying. I continue to be greeted by people who disappear or show no interest, so a change from that would be appreciated. I'm open to new things and happy to go over anything if the roleplay isn't working out or changes need to be made. If we have roleplayed before and you fancy starting fresh, I'm happy to speak again and possibly make a new roleplay together. \n\nCurrently my favourite settings are Fantasy, Wild West, Apocalyptic (Zombie or Wasteland), and Slice of Life. I have a few rough ideas in mind for each but I usually like to combine, and share interests/ideas to make the plot best suited to both our likings as possible. I typically like to write at least one-three paragraphs or more for a reply and expect something similar from my roleplay partner. I usually look for a long-term story that can fit in plenty of action, adventure, drama, romance and so much more. I am not judgemental when it comes to character builds and ideas, so go wild! However I do prefer more feminine characters to roleplay with.\n\nIf this takes your interest and you want to make a new world with me, please feel free to send over a message and we can discuss further ideas. All I ask is for you to be 18+ and be just as eager as me!\n\nThank you for reading and hopefully I'll talk to you soon!",

I like to write with detail and thought behind everything and I'm looking for someone similar. I write between 1 to 3 paragraphs but will match you if you write more. I write in 1st person, it just seems the most personal (: \n\nI am looking for our characters to have romance and a real connection! With the endgame being that they get married and have a couple kids maybe. I prefer we use reference pics for our characters instead of just descriptions. I also love world building so reference pictures come in handy for that as well. \n\nThe roleplay that I have in mind has an overlaying theme which is that you are my protector. You see I'm rather helpless, and I want to feel safe in your arms, I want to feel like you are someone that I can count on and I want to be in awe of you! Eventually I want you to teach me to defend myself, but that'll come later! \n\nThe  roleplay takes place in a fantasy setting, the Kingdom of Rosehaven, during times of war, with dragons, magic, mermaids, the whole nine yards. My Father, the King, has waged war against all magical beings. He has ordered you to safely transport me to an undisclosed location, but seeing as I am my father's daughter there is a target on my head. Could we be the people that bring peace to the land? \nI had in mind that your character is a stable hand around my age, or he could be way older than me and a magical character in disguise that has planned to betray the kingdom. But we can discuss this further on discord! \n\n\nLet me know if this interests you, hit me up and let's get something started! Hope to hear from you! \nThe most thoughtful message usually gets a response from me!",

            "selftext": "\n\nHello everyone, I go by the name Mori and i\u2019m 18 years old, almost 19! I\u2019ve been roleplaying for quite some time, I\u2019d say for 3 years now. During the years of roleplaying with others, I have done genres such as : Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Horror/Thriller, Mystery, and more. Now that I look back on those times, I had only did a small handful of romance roleplays, which pains me a bit. So instead of doing my other highlight genres, I wanted  to focus more on romance! Of course it\u2019s not just gonna be the plain straight ol\u2019 kiss here and there, it\u2019s gonna have some spark to it. Throw in some Angst, Comedy,Action, and Slice of Life! It sounds a bit clich\u00e9, but c\u2019mon it\u2019s gonna be fun.\n\n\nDepending on my partner, I can match the length that you\u2019re more comfortable to right at, I don\u2019t really mind! I vary in between Semi-Lit and Adv. Lit.(Basically Literate). I can reply pretty fast, depending on what i\u2019m doing at the moment. On weekends, I\u2019m definitely free all the time, but on weekdays it varies from 2:40 pm to like 3 am EST is when i\u2019ll be free. (Most times I\u2019m free in the morning as well.) I hope that doesn\u2019t mess with any of my future partners a bit too much. If you want to give me some ideas for a plot you\u2019d like to try, then I\u2019m willing to listen! I hope to get to roleplay with many of you soon!",

            "selftext": "ROMANCE! Okay, romance isn't the only theme in a couple of these roles, but, I do like a good romance, especially since the holidays are rapidly approaching. So, a little about me. You can call me Shorty. I consider myself to be a semi-literate writer and write least a paragraph most times. Though I might find myself at a couple sentences. I never write one line responses. I write in first person, and usually in present tense. I'd like partner to be very similar! Also, I'd prefer my partner to be 22-26, as I am 22. I move in the central standard timezone in the US, and I work full-time.\n\nSo, I have 3 roles in mind that I would like to do. \n\n1. You and I live in two very different kingdoms. In the kingdom of Hykar, it's focused on war and combat, which is the kingdom your family rules. In the kingdom of Lythos, it's more focused on knowledge and wisdom. Our kingdoms are forging an alliance, and the two of us are arranged to be married. I've been sent ahead of the wedding to get to know you and eventually marry you. You're on the battlefield in the middle of a war, and I'm brought to you after my trip from my home.\n2. I recently moved to a small mountain town surrounded by a forest to get away from the bustling city. I moved to the outskirts of the forest, not far from the town. Unbeknownst to me, this town is full of werewolves and a few humans who help the pack that lives here. You're a member of this pack (the alpha, next in line to be alpha, etc.), and you've been tasked to make sure I'm not a threat to your pack, either as a rival werewolf or a hunter. However, I have a secret. Will you find out, or will it stay secret?\n3. It's Christmas! Or at least it's getting close to Christmas. This role is super open to ideas. Are we friends that get closer? Is there a grumpy Grinch character? Did we get snowed in? There's a lot of possibilities!\n\nThere's a lot of ideas here! I would love to discuss them with you! The roles are subject to minor changes, and I usually roleplay here on Reddit through the chat system. So, feel free to shoot me a chat request!",

            "selftext": "Good evening everyone! I'm back to role playing after taking some time away, I'm seeking a few new role play partners to keep me busy. I absolutely love long term role plays I find they really build up characters, I love having something I can really get involved in and enjoy. I also really enjoy OOC discussions I think it's important to build up a good relationship with the person your role playing with. \n\nA little bit about me, I've been role playing on and of for ten years, I see myself as semi literate, I can post anywhere between two to six paragraphs depending on the situation and partner  ( sometimes more if I have a descriptive partner ) . I love romance role plays but the sole focus doesn't have to be romance, I prefer modern day role plays but happy to add elements of fantasy into the role play if you prefer ^-^ . I have a few ideas that out list below, but this is not what I'm limited to doing happy to hear your ideas or brain storm one together ^-^. \n\nIdea 1 ) Your character is part of  a group of Hunters who protect the human world from demons, unbeknown to humans demons have been living  alongside them for centuries possessing humans and trying to take over the human realm for themselves, if it wasn't for the Hunters keeping them at bay it would of probably happened, each Hunter has their own unique set of strengths and abilities, some magic, some weapon yielding ( we can discuss this in more depth ) Hunters are choosen specifically to do with their birth line, my character was adopted has no idea that she is a hunter, until she turns 18 and suddenly becomes aware of strange things around her, especially a particular attack at night where a demon comes to kill her only for your character to come and protect her, take her back to the institute where they all live and things are revealed to her. ( very interested in doing this one ) \n\nIdea 2 ) vampire x human think of this a bit like twilight only without the sparkling vampire xD. We can discuss this more if you wish. \n\nIdea 3) detective story line. I had a idea where my character got sucked into the mafia world by her boyfriend, unbeknown to her he was a wanted criminal, he was a huge mafia boss dealing drugs all up and down the country, he was dangerous, aggressive and demanding, even if she wanted to leave she couldnt, she knew he would kill her, he threatened to hurt her family and ner friends to, so she was trapped...that was until you came along and found her, pleading with her to help you to bring him down...so many awesome ways we could go with this! \n\nIdea 4 ) cops....simple idea here we both work for the police force perhaps I'm a new recruit and you get assigned to tutor me, lots of potential ideas and twists for this one . \n\nSo there is just a few of my ideas I'm a sucker for romance so would love for that to be a factor in the role play :)  I'm more then happy to discuss anything else in messages . So feel free to message me ^-^",

Keep it fair. \n\n-Respect my boundaries, I'll respect yours. \n\n-Please share a bio or a bit of information about your character (and an fc if possible, but it's not required) \n\n-Be patient with me, please.

Short-term because I'm currently in my exams period and just need a small something on the side to distract me and keep me happy. If we end up clicking, though, we could look into becoming long-term partners if we want to.\n\nI plan to roleplay a feline OC, probably a smaller one like a lynx. Depending on my partner, I can either play as a male or a female, I'm comfortable with either one. The genres I'm looking for is especially romance, slice of life and maybe a bit of suspense. The setting I would prefer is Cherryton High School, and I'd love to explore a relationship twisted by the two characters' instincts. It can be a carnivore-herbivore sort of relationship or more of a rivalry (feline-canine, for example), I'll adapt to my partner, as long as the feral instincts is a driving point in the story. \n\nI'm a bit more comfortable with OCs as I'd rather not roleplay as canon characters, but if you want to roleplay as canon characters interacting with my OC, that's fine as well.\n\nHit me up in a private message or a DM if interested. After a couple replies, I should be able to see if I'd like to play with you. :)",

We both are in a understanding life happens but please don\u2019t take five to six days to tell me so, that something is up. As it makes me worry. Also possible I could become disinterested in the roleplay or even starting it. I will not tolerate ghosting. It\u2019s happened to many times to me now. As roleplay genres go we will discuss them. For the most part I\u2019m pretty laid back. I love talking out of ooc. It gives us chances to talk about what the next plans are neither of us should be the only ones carrying the plot. It should be a team effort. \n\n\n\u256d\u22b1 \ud835\udc16\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc08\ud835\udc26 \ud835\udc0b\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc24\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc20 \ud835\udc05\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2b!!\u22b1\u256e\n.Someone who is active \n.18 and 25 is my age limit. You do not have to share your age or name when messaging me.   \n.Someone who likes doing any kinda plot. Especially toxic relationships and antagonist dark roleplays. \n.Someone who will enjoy talking ooc \n.Someone who can play multiple characters up to at least two. \n .Someone who is literate to advance literate \n .Someone who won\u2019t ghost me and give up when the plot gets boring. Or just block me for no reason. Or lie to me that they love the plot. To just later do the things I have mentioned \n.Someone who puts a lot of time and effort in what they roleplay as well as the plot. \n .Someone who is willing to have fun with the plot and laugh and grow our characters \n .Someone who will communicate \n.Be consistent with replying. \nThe ones stared are the ones I really want to do right now. \n\n\ud835\udc05\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2f\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc06\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2c\n- \ud835\udc20\ud835\udc31\ud835\udc20\u2b50\ufe0f\n- \ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc31\ud835\udc20( me)\u2b50\ufe0f\n- \ud835\udc00\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc20\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2d \u2b50\ufe0f \n-Physco\u2b50\ufe0f\n- \ud835\udc06\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc20 \ud835\udc11\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc32\ud835\udc2c\u2b50\ufe0f\n- Demons\n- \ud835\udc15\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc11\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc32\ud835\udc2c\n- \ud835\udc16\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc30\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1f \ud835\udc11\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc32\ud835\udc2c\n- \ud835\udc02\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc20e\n-Witch hunter\n- \ud835\udc0c\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc2c \n-Enemy to Lover\n- \ud835\udc03\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc24 \ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc32\ud835\udc2c\u2b50\ufe0f\n\nP.s.

            "selftext": "Hello. After a while I returned back to role-playing so I don't have any really specific ideas. Since Geeking app is never coming back, this became my only way to find other Role Players.\n\nSomething about me. I'm 20 year old guy from Central Europe. I prefer mostly realistic or slightly futuristic or even slightly fantasy genres. I do roleplay in 3rd person and past tense. Trying to always push myself I am trying to do 2 or 3 paragraphs on average. If I have the motivation, I'll do more. I don't consider myself Advanced, more like a beginner / semi - amateur or even amateur. I realised that I always did the same thing over and over again so.. I'm trying to get out of the comfort zone. So try to suggest any ideas you can. I'll be looking forward to hear them out! \n\nI usually do daily replies and since next week is my last school week for this year, I'll have a ton of free time on my hands. Winter holidays and stuff until January 10th or so. I'm not exactly sure when. \n\nWe will have time to discuss what exactly we could do, where we could take the RP or develop a plot for the story. Good communication is always the basic. \n\nI mostly do Plot less but in last few weeks I found out that plot is important to at least keep track of the story, to not strafe way too off the original idea. \n\nSo hit me up in DMs here. I'll give you my discord name and we can figure something out!",

Thinking of either a regular ol' slice of life sort of plot with our characters as humans (or a super scandalous plot for drama), werewolves, royals, vampires or something of that nature. I myself am female, in my twenties, and have rp'd for about 10 years. I rp with female OCs, am most comfortable with 3rd person, and wouldn't mind world building or a more simple plot. I don't like writing in first person, sorry! Faceclaims, artwork, or description of our characters works fine with me. I'm on eastern time, but don't mind if you're in a different time zone. And life is busy! I understand if you need a day or two sometimes to reply because sometimes I do too! \n\nSo what I'm looking for in a partner includes the following:\n\n\\- Be able to do semi-literate to literate responses (NO ONE LINERS!)\n\n\\- Is comfortable writing in the third person perspective.\n\n\\- Doesn't mind rping with OCs \n\nThat's pretty much it! :D Oh and I like using Discord as of right now for rps c:\n\nIf you're interested, send me a chat or a message and we can brainstorm something together :)\n\n Thank you!",

I just need to be able to read it and know whats happening! \n\nI am open to so many things! I prefer high fantasy, no modern. Usually midevil or Renaissance Era. I have been interested in future stuff before aswell though. I'm just not a fan of role-playing in the now. \n\nSome topics I like: space, aliens, Witcher, dnd, serial killers, horror, vampires, werewolves, creatures, Penny dreadful, American horror story, and more! Im not too interested in typical furry stuff, sorry. \n\nI prefer 1-2+ paragraphs, 4 sentences each, the more detail the better for the most part. I give what my partner gives! I do want someone to help me build a story, I've been leading all my roleplays lastly and it's just burning me out. I need someone to help come up with ideas with me.  \n\nEveryone has a life! I'm here to have fun and release stress. However I hate ghosters, if you gotta go, just say so. If you need some time away. Just tell me! Id like to think im a pretty easy person to get along with! I also love new friends and love talking outside the roleplay! \n\nPlease send me a message or chat with me and we will hopefully get started! Thanks for your time! \u2661",

Too many times I've ran into that here so if you're going to do either one of these don't bother.\n\nHello all! I\u2019ve been writing well over 14 years at this point. There\u2019s nothing I really haven\u2019t done, save for stuff like furries and what have you. This pandemic has lead to a lot of new and old viewing of TV shows and Movies for me, Recently fell back in love with Shippuden!\n\nNow, I don\u2019t have any kind of definite plot or set idea for any of this but I do know I want us to have a good time! I really ask that you help me push any of these stories forward, as carrying a story and setting absolutely everything else makes the idea and point of a partner kind of pointless also, feel free to throw some creative curveballs at me as well! \n\nAs far as replies and availability goes. I work 7-5 every day of the week but am usually off weekends. And during my downtime at work I\u2019m glued to my phone watching movies or reading stuff anyway so I\u2019ll definitely be able to pump out the replies. That in no way means I expect you to do the same. Life is life. We all have busy spells and I\u2019m understanding. I don\u2019t ghost either. Unfortunately that\u2019s a plague upon this community and I despise it.\n\n\n(ALL CHARACTERS ARE OF AGE)\nIno, Hinata, Temari, Kurenai, Karin, Anko, Shizune, Sakura, (Adult) Sarada, Natshui, (Adult) Hokuto.\n\n\nP.S: I am still just picking up where I left off at the start of the Pain Assault arc so bare with me as I get back into the stories and such!",

            "selftext": "\\[ Not replacing any current partners! \\]\n\nOla everyone. I'm currently looking for a couple new roleplays. I'm 23 years old and I've been roleplaying for 12 years. Despite being a college student I'm an active writer; it keeps me sane, haha. And what's more fun than writing alone? Writing together!\n\nI'm looking for people who are 18+. It's important to me to write with people who can match me when it comes to writing 3rd person, writes at least 1 to 2 paragraphs per reply (but more is always welcome) and who can reply at least once per 2 a 3 days most of the time (please be honest with yourself whether this fits in your (future) schedule. It's quite tiring to keep starting stories and then someone calling it quits a week in :c). I am not ghost friendly (but overall very friendly!! ;p); if you've lost interest just tell me and we can part on good terms. That said, I'm really big on communication; if there's something bothering you; just tell me. Often times it's nothing we can't fix and a good story won't go to waste. It's a plus if you love chatting ooc; I've made great friends through that! : )\n\nAs the title states I write gay pairings. Genres I enjoy are modern slice of life and fantasy. For fantasy, the plot I currently have open is specific; this may not be for everyone. Feel free to ask about it though! It's medieval fantasy and there's lots of world building to be done : ) I enjoy playing 'against' masculine characters in both looks and personality. (For slice of life; I require real life faceclaims. For fantasy, I'm fine with art.)\n\nIt may be a lot to take in, but this is ultimately what works best for me! I have a document full of plots ready for those who are interested. If you are, please shoot me a message here and tell me why you think we'd be a good match so we can exchange discords!",

Hi, I\u2019m Kemi. \n\nA little about me!\n\nI write in 3rd person and past tense. I usually keep it at 1-3 paragraphs. The length of your replies doesn\u2019t really matter to me, but 3-4 paragraphs should be the max. Quality over quantity, you know. And ADHD. English is not my first language and even though I\u2019ve been writing for years I do not see myself as advanced so if your bar is already high, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the one for you. \n\nI\u2019m 27 so it goes without saying that I do not write with minors even if it\u2019s SFW. Nor are any of the characters allowed to be under 20. I would hope for you to be 19+. \n\nI can write either on Reddit or Discord. \n\nI have a very miscellaneous work schedule so I won\u2019t be able to reply all the time but I don\u2019t expect you to either. Daily replies are my goal though. \n\nSo if you\u2019re still interested, I\u2019m looking to write either as **Leon Kennedy**, **Sherry Birkin**, **Ada Wong** or **Donna Beneviento** against your OC! \n\nStory wise I haven\u2019t planned anything yet but it would be perfect if we didn\u2019t have to go completely canon. I would love to brainstorm or hear about your ideas if you have any!\n\nI\u2019m also open to taking the canon characters out of their own story and putting them into an AU. \n\nDon\u2019t hesitate to message me if you\u2019re interested! &lt;3",

My work is very mentally taxing and I\u2019ve been wanting to seek out a couple of partners for long-term, literate RP so I have something fun and creative on the side!\n\n*This isn\u2019t to replace my current partners! I just have too much creative brain this weekend!\n\nSome things about my RP preferences: \n\n-Third person only, I can do past or present tense depending on partner preference but lean toward present. \n\n-I aim for two to three paragraphs per reply, though this can fluctuate according to the scene. \n\n-Activity level will fluctuate as well, depending on my workload, but I try to get a few posts out per week at least! I\u2019m in EST. Time zones don\u2019t really matter much to me though. \n\n-I like a good balance of romance/action/adventure. There has to be a romantic element, but I\u2019m not looking to just write straight slice-of-life. I like a good plot. \n\n-I can write on discord, via email, or Google docs.\n\nWhat I\u2019m looking for in a partner:\n\n-Please be literate. I find it hard to be interested in one-liners. \n\n-Please also be over 18, though over 21 is preferred. \n\n-Help with the plot - I love building a story with my partners, and I find it always goes smoothly when we work on it together! \n\n-If you\u2019re having a block or not interested in the storyline, please let me know so we can either plot something else or skip ahead or whatever needs to be done! \n\n\nOn to the good stuff: \n\nSpecifically looking for Spike to play with my Vicious. I\u2019m just about done watching the Netflix series and I\u2019m loving it - it\u2019s bringing back my long-dormant fixation on the anime. I\u2019d be happy to set it in either universe. We could write something maybe set during their past, or figure out an AU to go forward with. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested, comment or DM me, and we can plot!",

I\u2019ve been a fan of Mass Effect for a while and am hoping to be able to get an RP going on set up in the world!\n\nTo clarify, I\u2019m hoping to establish an original story in the universe, (likely around pre ME2 to ME3, maybe more after). By original, I mean I won\u2019t be playing canon characters. You can feel free to though, however! Just no commander shepherd.\n\nI have a preference to play against female characters, but IRL gender doesn\u2019t matter to me in the slightest :)\n\nI tend to type in third person, using discord, with multiple paragraphs a post. Sometimes a little less. I very much enjoy details and the literacy! I am open to all themes; dark, romance, etc etc.\n\nI\u2019m also hoping for this to be long term! That we can hopefully build a storyline and a cast of characters together that will let us keep going on and on into the future! I have a few ideas for characters, but we can hash all of this out together!\n\nWe can talk a little bit over Reddit then move to discord! So I know you read this, include yourself favorite ME character somewhere in there! (Jack or Garrus is mine :) )",

Thanks for reading!**\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nViktor lift his gaze from the book currently displayed on the desk. Thankfully, his improvised office had a pretty view for him to relaxe every once in a while. Although not in his nature to waste time, in the recent time he was learning to aprecciate the place where he was now. After all, it was his dream. He just needed an opportunity. He knew he could do great things. He knew he could be recognized in the whole world. He knew that he could help.\n\nHis chain of thought was interrupted by his cough. Just two spasms and that was it. He was used to it anyway. His eyes went back to the project, one he knew didn't have much of a future from the moment he laid eyes on it.\n\n**AMAZING DISCOVERY - LIFECHANGING.**\n\n*Alright, that was a stretch.*\n\nHe sighed and grabbed his old, worn out pen, then marked a little x on the first page. He didn't bother with reading the whole thing. Since he had been \"promoted\" (thanks to his and Jayce's discovery on hextech) his old conviction about not wasting a bright scientist valuable time was reinforced. He got angry for a moment.\n\n*How! Now, there's so much we can do with hextech. So much potential. A chance to do something useful for one time and the Council gets bothered with... this!*\n\nViktor smacked the back of his hand against the book disdainfully. He placed it on the desk and run his right hand through his hair while looking at the landscape in front of him.\n\n*Alright, be calm. You still can do it. You know you can.*\n\nHe sitted on the chair and began to list off why the idea of building a hextech device wich would show the time of the major cities of Runeterra wasn't a priority. There were some more important matters at hand.\n\n*Such as doing something about that poor people inhaling those toxic gases in Zaun.*\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHi! Thanks again for reading. I began to write something to showcase my style and hoping it would catch someone's attention.\n\nI loved Arcane, as did most of the people who watched it. If you are one of those who didn't watched it yet, I truly recomend it. Every character of the show is charismatic, but I was particularly enticed by Viktor. He is portrayed in such a human and compelling way that I couldn't help but come here to look for a roleplay partner to help me write a history where I get to play him.\n\nI want to develope a romantic relationship between Viktor and some other character of the show. I'm not totally against an Original Character (OC), but I'd rather do this roleplay with the canon characters. Nevertheless, if you have an OC and looking forward to play with them, don't be afraid of messaging me with a presentation of them. For the canon characters, I'd really like to play an unexpected pairing, such as Vi/Viktor or Caitlyn/Viktor. But still, I'm fine with playing almost every pairing, just tell me wich characters are you willing to play as. Needless to say that your gender doesn't need to match the character's gender.\n\nI also want to build a backstory while the romance gets going. In that matter, Arcane it's a very fertile soil. I'd like to focus in the Piltover and Zaun's conflictive relationships with all the class confrontation that entails. Meanwhile, Silco and the gangs of Zaun get ready to confront the Council politics. I'm sure that we can work something out with that. Of course, our characters would intervene in the conflict.\n\nIn your message, present yourself or your character the way you see fit and you feel comfortable with. It can be something along the lines I wrote or something more structured. Any idea that you want to play out is welcome.\n\nLast, english is not my language. I use this as a way of getting better at it, apart from the obvious interest in roleplaying. Sorry for my mistakes.",

Would their be a ego clash as these two battle hardened warriors try and find their own space and co-exist on that Helicarrier? What if a women got in-between them? A women like Black Widow?\n\nThis is a long term detailed plot I had in mind focusing on  slice of life, adventure drama and romance as well as several other themes . I like to find a balance between this and would love to discuss in-depth with anyone interested in the initial idea. Anyone who has a interest in the character of Black Widow and Marvel, I would love to hear fro Khoi.\n\nThis scenario would focus on the  pursuit of Black Widow by Captain Britain, the growing emotions between them as they work together and eventually the succumbing to that tension while he tries to assert his place in S.H.I.E.L.D. \n\nWe could start anywhere along the journey, however a favourite would be starting out at a point of high tensions between the captain\u2019s when two critical espionage missions occur simultaneously, Black widow is offered a choice, accompany her preferred captain or risk leaving him in the company of Maria Hill on a intense operation.\n\nIf your interested, enquire and we can discuss further!",

I want this to quell a craving of intimacy between the two, so it will likely involve some content that is 18+.\n\nI tend to mimic the length of my partners post, but I'm generally ballparking for around at least a minimum of a paragraph if not more.

Historical settings are a no go for me (steampunk, etc)- but fantasy settings with magic, faries and kingdoms are a-okay!\n\u2022Typically I roleplay on discord but I have the tendency to tap on a dm, read the reply and get back to it later due to the fact that Im online often and gaming. So apologies if I take a hot minute to reply! \n\u2022Regarding literacy, I match my partner\u2019s length unless they\u2019re over 10 paragraphs.

Someone who compliments said character would be fantastic!\n\u2022Other themes that shall not be named on this specific post can be discussed over dms as I am an avid fan of horror/psychological themes and have an idea formed about a certain knife throwing kpop idol from Dead By Daylight. \n\u2022Plot wise, I\u2019d love to create a plot with my partner but if we need any inspiration I have an old plot list we can pluck from!

            "selftext": "Hello everyone!\n\nToday I'm on the hunt for a new partner to play out a long term romance roleplay involving a demon and a human.\n\nI have a few basic Ideas that I would like to incorporate into the roleplay, but a few things will need some flushing out before we begin.\n\nThe basic idea I had for the plot is this:\n\nIn the heart of New York city a few supernatural beings have always held positions of importance. Demons, Vampires, werewolves and the like have a tight grip on the government and law enforecement thanks to a centuries old treaty used to keep the peace. While humans go about their day unknowing that these beings even exsist, those higher on the food chain know who they really report to.\n\nThat's where my character comes in to play, I'd like for him to be the son of a wealthy and powerful mafia style nightclub owner. This specific chain of nightclubs throughout the cities underground are special however....they are for supernatural beings only. \n\nMy idea is that one night by total accident your character would find herself wandering into one of these clubs where she would happen to find my character. Where the story goes from here is up to us, but I'd love to play it out as a long term forbidden romance between the pair. \n\n**If you're interested please shoot me a private message or chat here on reddit**, I would love to hear any ideas you may have for this and brainstorm some before we begin :)",

I was thinking that we could start ourselves off at the first season and just go for it? Make our own plots or maybe follow the canon plot with our own events included? I\u2019m really flexible!\n\nI have a million characters that I can pull from, most are women, but I have a few male characters. I\u2019ve been roleplaying as superheroes for nearly six years now, going on seven. So the amount of stuff I\u2019ve done and the ideas bouncing around in my little noggin is astronomical.\n\nI, personally, will be playing my OCs. You can play yours, or you can play a canon character if that\u2019s more your jam! Make them your own, insert your own headcanons! Doesn\u2019t bother me a bit whichever you decide, just know that I won\u2019t play canon characters for you; please don\u2019t ask me to.\n\nIf you\u2019ve stuck around this long, thanks for reading!

            "selftext": "Hello there, Stranger!\n\nThanks for checking out my post, and I hope you're doing well. I can only assume that you'd remain to read this in its entirety and find something that catches your eye. If you stick around, please make sure to read everything properly.\n\nI'm essentially for someone who'd be interested in plotting a roleplay based on the Harry Potter series with me.

Even tho I have a small experience on reddit, I consider myself as a very detailed, creative and openminded person who just reading and writing in general. What do I love more than reading and writing? ONE PIECE. So I thought of combining those two and hopefully I can find a partner who would share the same passion for both of those aswell, haha! Now, I am updated on all the new one piece series, including the manga and I am seeking a partner who would be the same, or at least someone who's watched the majority of OP!\n\nThe scene itself would be a bit fantasy and it won't stick too much to the original story as I would like that you play an OC. The OC can be either gender and it will be quite simple; After the Wano, an accident similiar to the Kuma one happened. The SWORD came with an gun that catapulted all the strawhats to random locations in order to save them. As Robin gets catapulted to a random location, that is where your OC comes into the play, an up and coming pirate who wants to capture her and make a name for himself. \n\nI can explain more if you're interested, just DM me!: )",

            "selftext": " \n\nHi there. I'm looking for a sci-fi roleplay involving robots and or androids. The only things I ask is that you're semi lit and a creative person to braintorm any new ideas. I'll share few plots but I have few more and we can also create one from scrath so let's begin\n\n**Plot 1:**\n\nInside a videogame studio, a game developer is in charge of a final boos that is being developed for an videogame and an interactive experience. The developer is using neural networks to give the final boss a more deep aproach with the player. The final boss will be capable to say unique lines and change strategies according to his pre programmed personality , scenario and avaliable tools. The plan changes when the ambitious projects is pushed a step further. The investors payed to create an interactive park with the characters from the video game. Almost like playing the game in real life. However, the game developer gets stressed for all that presure and he express that while testing the game with the final boss. However, one day the character just dissapiered. Who knows where the boss is it right now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Plot 2**\n\nThis plot has a more \"free roam approach\". A successful engineer didn't have a good life. He got used to be that calm and good kid during school. He studied his major and finished it successfully. He got a good job, he wins a good amount of money but there's something missing still. He felt the fatigue of the routine even if he likes engineering. So he decided to explore new experiences. He explored the city when he witnessed an assault of a bank from the street. The engineer stayed back with nobody to help the victims of the assault so he got an idea. With his knowledge, the engineer decided to do something.\u00a0 He designed an android capable to help him during action at night. From that day to know they both solve crimes at night and save the people who need them and probably, the human would finally fill that hole in his life. Maybe. Who knows.\n\n**Plot 3**\n\nThere's a jorunalist is investigating about a conspiracy theory in the city after a strange incident. It is shared on the internet that police officers are hidding information from different cases that involve politics and murdering. The journalist didn't like to do that job but he was working for the fact checking department so he basically started to talk with some officers. Including one of them that has something strange. The journalist talked in two occasions with that officer, he thinks the officers was cold. He knew there was something wrong so he decided to follow that officer during the night. The journalist saw the officer getting out of the police department but goes into a strange stairs. The journalsit followed until he got inside to what it seems like a secret laboratory with different officers. They all went to the center to that machine where they revealed their truth nature or actually their real origine, they're artificial. Android, mindless and programmed to hide crimes govement needed to reserve to themselve in order to continue their domain. The journalist got impressed but when he was trying to get out, he finds the officer he talked before. He got discovered. The journalist has to escape from that strange basement. What will happen next? Will the android officer comply with this programming or something might happen with him?\n\n**Plot 4**\n\nDuring a war, there's an alien faction which has lost his general. A powerful general that could have been almost a legend between humans. Fortunately they have technology. They've decided to build their own general in order to test their infiltration technologies to war against humans. And it worked really well to be honest but nothing last forevers and even machines may have some defects.\n\n**THANK YOU**\n\nI'm glad you have read all the post. Thank you for that. I roleplay on discord so send me a message or pm me if you're interested. Thank you and see you soon.",

I\u2019m not sure normally how many sports related rp prompts are posted here but as a big NBA I\u2019ve suffered the terrible storylines of the 2K games for long enough!  As a person who actually cares both for story and basketball I think I could do a better job!Therefore I\u2019d like to GM a basketball story related prompt!  We\u2019ll be beginning with your character at the end of high school, about to enter college and begin their career there!  I don\u2019t mind them either starting off an ultra hyped college/High school prospect like Zion or Lebron, a sleeper hit, getting less attention like many other players, working to gain the recognition they deserve.  Just write up an interesting backstory/motives for them preferably! I\u2019d love for them to be a little more complex than \u201cJust a guy that loves basketball\u201d. Why do they want to make the NBA? Are they trying to provide for their family?  Do they have a supernatural Jordan esque competitive desire?  The choice is yours! And so is the college your player goes to! They could have many colleges begging for their enrolment, or maybe just one offering them a scholarship! Whatever you fancy. Alternatively you could kick this off at the end of college and go right to the league! Up to you!\n\nThere\u2019d be action both on and off the court, possibly romance, much drama, all sorts! Message me if your interested and give me a little description of your character!  Discord is needed for this!  Hope to see you soon!  Please don\u2019t come with a huge edgelord, it always sucks trying to form a fun, interesting story with them! I post in lengths of 2+ decently sized paragraphs! We\u2019ll go from the start of the college circuit and onwards! As far into your player\u2019s nba career as you fancy!\n\nI would like these character info things from you! Send them to me and if you seem literate and fun we can begin! Please make your character interesting, I hate carrying all the dialogue and personality load!\n\nName\n\nAge\n\nPosition\n\nAppearance description\n\nHeight\n\nWeight\n\nGeneral play style\n\nFavourite teams\n\nFavourite players\n\nStats They Averaged in High School/College\n\n\nI\u2019d also happily do this but with Football or soccer as the sports! So let me know! I know the most about basketball but I\u2019d be able to handle the other ones no problem either!",

            "selftext": " Hello! So while I'm frequently looking for fandoms, I do have a list of original prompts pinned on my profile, and I'm seeking a couple partners who are excited to explore them with me. Before you head there, though, please read through the following and make sure that we agree on what a good partnership looks like:          \n\n\\- I am an \"advanced/literate\" writer and want a partner who is the same (this is very important; I'm a professional editor, and it's ruined me for polite society).     \n\n\\- Multi-para, please, though I don't need (or want) a whole chapter for each reply. Just some substance to work with.       \n\n \\- If the prompt includes romance, I only write the female in male/female pairings for these ideas.     \n\n\\- I do not and will not write ERP with you. This is a hard boundary for me.     \n\n\\- I'm in my late 20s, so I will only write with partners who are over 18, with 21+ preferred.     \n\n\\- Email is preferred, but I can do others. Just ask.     \n\n\\- Lastly, I have major depressive disorder and can lose motivation during an episode. If you haven't heard from me, please feel free to poke me and check in. It might just be a bad day. But if I genuinely can't continue, I'll let you know.          \n\n That's it! If you feel like we're a match and one of my prompts interests you, send me a message! I won't reply to thread comments, so make sure to use the PM or chat functions.          \n\nThank you much!",

            "selftext": "The sleep study lab was supposed to be the easiest credit of Kyle McKinnon's fall semester. When he spotted the row of tearaway sheets printed on light blue paper promising a single credit for just three hours a week spent monitoring participants' brain waves during dream activity practically covered by campus rideshare offers and a flyer advertising a residence hall-wide game of kickball, Kyle couldn't pocket the lab TA's phone extension fast enough. Although he was only a sophomore, a credit that wasn't part of an already daunting course load might make the difference of whether he'd get to graduate early enough, and, pretty literally, the student-athlete with short, sandy locks and freckled cheeks would get to sleepwalk his way to an easy A.\n\nOf course, the lab wasn't the most ideal place to catch a nap. The cot Kyle was assigned had a rigid frame and austere mattress, and even when he tried to get comfortable, resting his arms beneath the scratchy cotton pillowcase, he couldn't help but peek out to a windowed wall of stern, spectacled glances from a small platoon of biology students scribbling into legal pads.\n\n*Tick tick, tick-tock, tick tick tick.*\n\nAnd, then, of course, there was that dumb clock. The one mounted on the wall just above the bedposts, the one that was wound too loudly and rang in his ears when he closed his eyes and try to will his stressed student brain to relax for an hour, just an hour, that's it.\n\n*Tick, tock tock tock tock tock tock tock.*\n\nKyle's eyes flickered open, wide awake now in a darkened laboratory: The fluorescents had been shut off, and if there was anyone on the research side of the shared wall, they were obscured in darkness. A wincing glance at the clock raised a bubbling sense of panic into his chest: Somehow, he'd been allowed to oversleep, to the point where his public speaking course was in five minutes. Kyle sprang to his feet, reaching under the cot for his backpack, when a voice froze him in place. It was strangely familiar, although the sophomore couldn't place its timbre.\n\n\"It's not there. At least, not here.\"\n\nA pause, from both of them.\n\n\"You're dreaming.\"\n\nRolling his eyes to no one's amusement but his own, Kyle looked back up at the clock with a kind of unsteady dizziness. This time, though, when he turned back around, the cold linoleum of the lab's floors had been replaced by the smooth wooden backstage boards of the performing arts building. His gaze broadened at the sight of classmates milling around, some in nonsensical costumes: Dreamlike, but also par for the course when it came to theater majors.\n\n\"They're doing more than just measuring your brain activity when you're dreaming, you know. But that's for you to figure out. Well, you and someone else. But you'll find her soon, I'd imagine.\"\n\nKyle bit his lower lip to keep his head from swimming over this sudden shift of venue, not to mention the voice he was positive only he could hear. There's a moment where he considered willing himself to wake up, but, no, not yet. There was apparently someone he had to find. That felt like it meant something. He folded his arms over his chest, jolting out of his thoughtfulness when he felt his forearms touch bare skin.\n\n\"Oh, and you're apparently in one of those in-class-in-your-underwear dreams, so I'd make your rendezvous quick.\"\n\nKyle's knees locked as he pressed his back up against the fluttering curtain of the theater's stage, trying to stand still and not draw attention to himself. If this mystery \"her\" was another sleep study participant, well, he could only hope her own lucid dreams had brought her to this particular wing of campus.\n\n\\*\\*\n\nHello! I'm a 27-year-old writer who just wrapped up a probably-too-long introduction to a collaborative story idea I've been dying to share! Basically, the TL;DR premise is that two college students participating in a sleep lab study end up in each other's dreams, and end up investigating the study they're part of, which isn't all it seems to be on the surface. All while getting to know each other (and, realistically) developing a mutual attraction both in their dreamscapes and real life! My goal with this prompt is basically to blend a sci-fi mystery with a slice-of-life rom-com, which might be a big ask, but hopefully I find a couple of partners willing to dive into this story together! Please be at least 20 years old, willing and eager to write long, detailed posts, and, if you're interested, please send me a snapshot of your character finding herself in a dream! Just to see how our writing styles click.",

I do not follow any of the main story with her, she is not the Warrior of Light or anyone overly important. Just a regular adventurer who is trying to make her way in the world.\n\nI am looking for a partner to strike up a romance with. Big bonus points if it's an Au Ra, as they are by far my favorite race especially the Raen. That being said I am not terribly picky and if I like your character I will give it a shot. Please be warned that just because we roleplay doesn't mean it will turn romantic, I'yumi is my main character and I want a serious partner that I know will RP for a long time.\n\nHere's a little about me:\n\n\\* I am 27 years old and live in the EST zone.\n\n\\* I have been roleplaying for about 15 years now, starting with Dungeons and Dragons when I was a kid. I've been text based roleplaying for about 10.\n\n\\* I have no real limits. We can discuss limits in general.\n\n\\* I prefer to do my text based rp in Discord.\n\nPlease let me know if this interests you! I look forward to hearing back from you.",

            "selftext": "Hello there! I hope all is well. I have been a big halo fan for several years now and I have never had the opportunity to do a true halo rp. I would like this to take place in the year that coincides with the game itself. The main enemies would be the banished. I would like to use OCs only. If you would like to use a reference from the lore you absolutely may.\n\nI want this to be fun and filled with action and adventure. I am also a fan of romance, so I would not be apposed to a slow burn relationship either. It would definitely make things interesting. I just ask that if you are interested you know the basics of halo. Ex.) Vehicles, weapons, enemy types etc. If you have questions regarding the lore, I'd be more than happy to answer them. \n\nI have been rping for about six years and I write in third person past tense. I can definitely take the lead on most aspect, however if you have ideas, please feel free to add them in. I love diversity and suspense. I want my partner to feel involved in the world. I have a character concept that has many years under his belt and I'll be more than happy to let you know. Just DM me!\n\nI also prefer that you be 18 and older before starting the rp. I am also looking for someone who responds at least once a day and if you can't, please just let me know.I am very patient and I understand life happens. Please don't feel pressured to write three paragraph responses. I know dialogue can is sometimes a one line response and that is okay. I only ask that you put effort into the responses for I will do the same.   If you are interested, as I said, please DM me and I'll happily discuss the plot with you.",

            "selftext": "Hello! I have been roleplaying for more than six years now, i'm a twenty-two person from Europe. I'm looking for a partner in crime to create a romantic story, i don't mind males, females or anything in between.\n\nMy writing style: I usually use the third person and past tense, my replies are at least one paragraph, I can write up to six or more paragraphs in my introductions or if the reply requires it. \n\nAbout the roleplay: It can be medieval, steampunk, modern, historical, futuristic. I won't play fandoms, i'm not a huge fan of them. I prefer to create with my partner our world and characters.\n\n-----\n\nThese are a couple of my ideas with an introduction. \n\n**[Medieval] Stolen heart**\n\nThis scenario is about a thief and a princess, they meet in her chamber when he was trying to stole her jewelry. This story could be everywhere, it is up to us. We can even make the princess a prince and the thief a woman.\n\nIntroduction:\n\n*Alexander had studied carefully the movements around the castle, the room of the King and Queen had guards outside of windows and doors and almost every other entrance. The choice was between one of the prince's room or the princess's. The decision was pretty easy for Alex, a princess usually had more jewels, dresses and rings so it made sense for a thief.*\n\n*Alex knew he had more or less twenty minutes to steal whatever he could, it was more or less how long the dinner lasted plus the time to climb inside of the room. The plan wasn't complicated. It was pretty easy, he never got caught before, he wasn't planning to be in the near future.*\n\n*The young man climbed the decorated walls of the castle, his black clothes and shadows were his best friends keeping him hid in the night. He made his way inside of the room, he couldn't believe his eyes. He had never seen so many jewels and valuable objects in one room.*\n\n*The thief took his trusted black bag and stole everything his hands could grab. Ten or more minutes passed and he was about to leave the room when he heard the handle of the door moving, his sapphire eyes widened. He didn't know what to do.*\n\n*Alex found himself with his small and soft hand on the mouth of the princess. He did it without even thinking, he was scared. He clearly was more scared than the woman in front of him, he was a thief not an assassin. He knew what was the punishment for stealing to a royal person. Death. He wasn't ready to die, he didn't want to.*\n\n-----\n\n**[Apocalyptic] Metro**\n\nThis scenario is inspired by the game Metro. Basically after the WW3 the world is a different place because of the numerous nuclear bombs used. People outside couldn't breath and found refuge inside of the metro, monsters were created because of the nuclear power. We can create a lot of stories about it, my idea is about a scientist looking for something in the metro with the help of a hunter.\n\nIntroduction:\n\n*Alexander pale skin seemed to shine as the light of the lamp was illuminating his face, papers were all over the worn wood table. Drawings of sections of the metro in every one of them. \n\"It has to be some water here.\" He whispered talking to himself pointing at one drawing. He had studied for months that section of the metro, an underground river had to pass under that.*\n\n*Alex was sure about it, it was his job after all so he was probably one of the few person that could know that. He scratched the back of his head, his obsidian hair moved like a wave as he did that. It was time to find someone to help him reach the destination.*\n\n*Alexander walked outside of his small room, locked it. He arrived at the tavern where most of the hunters were, these people were scavengers ready to find whatever a person could want inside of the metro or even outside. \n\"Are you a hunter?\" He asked with a naive expression.*\n\n-----\n\n**[Apocalyptic] New world**\n\nIn this scenario, a disease had spread and created some sort of zombies. Rich people decided to use cryogenic chambers to wait until that disease disappear. My idea is that one character had been in his chamber for 30 years while the other character born in this new world. \n\nIntroduction:\n\n*The noise of the chamber being opened echoed in the dark room, some of the lights switched on showing the metal pavement and walls of the room. A pale figure emerged from the small chamber, he fell on the floor and he started to cough. His feminine naked body was completely exposed, his sapphire eyes looked around the room. Memories of what happened started to flow inside of his mind, how many years had passed?*\n\n*\"Good morning Subject#562, Alexander De Dragon.\" A robotic voice coming from a speaker in the corner of the room started to communicate with the young man. \"Thirty years have passed since you entered in the chamber. In front of you will find a box with some of your clothes with some canned food and a survival kit in case the world had changed drastically. A backpack to carry everything you need.\"*\n\n*Alexander stood up, his legs were hurting after all they didn't move for thirty years. He took some of the clothes from the box, the monitor was telling him that was summer so he put on some short that were highlighting his small legs and a white blouse. The robotic voice continued to repeat the same words over and over again. After the fifth time, it stopped.\n\"Have a great permanence in the new earth.\" These were its last words.*\n\n*Alex took the backpack and put everything inside, it already weight so much. He wasn't a strong individual after all. The door could only be opened from the inside, he took a huge breath before opening the door. The hallway was filled on leaves and the ceiling was completely destroyed, he didn't know what to do. He heard some steps and what seemed a voice, he walked towards the source.*\n\n\n----\n\n**[Steampunk] Tornadoes**\n\nThis scenario is inspired by mortal engines. The cities in this world can move around because of steam powered engines, the reason why they have to move is because there are tornadoes that destroy everything in their way. My idea is one of us is a scientist that is make a research about these tornadoes and the other is a pilot that will help the first character to follow the path of one tornado.\n\nIntroduction:\n\nI have a introduction but seems to cause some problems with the bot. If you are interested I will send it to you. \n\n-----\n\n**[Modern] The newcomer**\n\nThis scenario is set in a highschool or college, the story begin in the second semester when my character goes for the first time in his new school. Your character could be a student or a teacher or whatever you want. \n\nIntroduction:\n\n*The sun was melting the snow on the roofs of the building in front of the school, the smoke which was coming from his cigarette was slowly making its way towards the sky. Alexander's back was leaned against the brick wall, it was cold so he was wearing a black coat and under it a white shirt. Blue jeans were trying to protect from the cold his longs legs which with the help of the chest were making his height of 6 feet. His sapphire eyes moved towards the arms of the huge clock inside of the school, he was late for his first lesson in the new school. He threw the cigarette on the ground and stepped on it, he began to walk towards the classroom number B-22.*\n\n*Alex felt the gaze of everyone on him, it was the second semester and he was the newcomer so he was already expecting it. His long blonde and curly hair moved like waves every step he made, the map on his hand was indicating the path he had to take to get in the classroom. After a couple of minutes of walking the writing B-22 was on the door in front of him, he took a huge breath and opened the door.*\n\n**[Anything] Bring your own idea!**\n\n------\n\nPlease send me a PM if you are interested in roleplaying with me. Send me a little description of you and in what types of scenarios are you interested. Have a nice day.",

I'm Sarah, I'm well over 21 and I'm from Australia.\n\nI'm looking for a specific type of role play that spans the latter half of WW2 and then the post-war years in America. The general idea is that my character (a male soldier) is injured during the war, sent to England to rehab and falls in love with a nurse. They try to keep in touch but lose contact. After the war they run into each other again and old sparks ignite.\n\nFirst and foremost I would like to play the male character. I'm looking for a partner who would be able to play a female character.\n\n(Please note: I am only looking to write with other females.) I'm also looking for someone who is over 18.\n\nI am a dedicated and literate role player and have been writing for many years. I love roleplaying and honestly, I am looking for a LONG TERM partner. I am looking for someone who can help create a detailed world with me, develop long term storylines, create side characters and add all the wonderful drama and angst and (hopefully) romance that a role-playing world can involve. I also use discord.\n\nI know I'm asking a lot but I REALLY hope there's someone out there looking to play a female character in the above mentioned time period.\n\nIf you're interested please message me!!",

He is conflicted, confused between friendship and love. Does he love his wife? Or his best friend has been the love of his life all along. \n\nWe can have multiple twists, brainstorm and so forth. The main angst of this is lots of drama. As his wife/GF is very possessive and clingy. Jealous. He has to handle her emotions and his best friend who is going through a lot, being supportive of her. Perhaps she's going thigh a break-up of her own? Lots of possibilities. And it can be a fun and entertaining roleplay. \n\nI only roleplay on discord.",

I know exactly what I'm looking for in terms of the concept and aesthetic but finding a writer who's interested in filling in the blanks of the story with me would be magnificent. I'm a pretty easygoing and patient writer and typically don't mind taking the story in different directions than what I had in mind, so feel free to talk to me about my idea!\n\nAnyways, I've always been interested in doing some sort of roleplay that gets psychological and surreal. I'd like to explore the subconscious a bit and is why I've decided to seek out something dream related! \n\nIn general, the easiest comparison to make to a dream-related RP would be Inception and although that's a totally fair thing to draw inspiration form, my interests are more aligned with a Satoshi Kon style of plot. Something weird, psychedelic, high-energy, and animation inspired, rather than a more grounded plot (because honestly who needs it to be grounded with an idea like this). In specific, I was thinking of Paprika, a movie I rewatched recently and felt like I was drawing a lot of fun ideas from. Eternal Sunshine is another one I'm familiar with and would be reasonable to take inspiration from, yet I remain set on Paprika as my main drive for wanting to do a roleplay like this. \n\nI want to borrow the energy and style Paprika has as well as the dream elements but I'm not strict about writing anything specific related to Paprika's plot. To be completely honest with you, I think the plot is vague enough for that to not matter. There is some technical explanation for dream infiltration, an established methodology, and some very extensive dream possibilities. Similarly, I think that's all our plot would need to take off, and I'm more than ready to chat about it with an interested partner!\n\nJust request to chat with me on reddit if you are interested and wish to talk about this! I'm only going to be replying to messages so please do that instead of commenting on the post. I prefer to roleplay on Discord and I'd be happy to add you there whenever you'd like. Hope to find some interest for this!",

I'd also love to see how Amanda's powers as a witch can play out with Ryuko's life fibers as well as their different personalities. I am a big sucker for the enemies to lovers trope, but all scenarios/ideas are welcome as long as they're romantic!\n\nAs a writer, I will rp in third person and will compose 1-3 paragraphs for each response, depending on necessity. Naturally, the first response will be the longest. I would prefer to be Ryuko, but am willing to be flexible about it!\n\nIf anyone could make this happen for me, it'd make me immensely grateful and happy. Don't be shy and feel free to reach out!

Before I get into the plot, here are some things about me and what I expect out of my partner. \n\n\u2022 I\u2019m 22, so 18+ partners only. Not up for negotiation. \n\u2022 Write at least two good paragraphs. I can write up to 12-15, but also 2-5, I\u2019ll match my partner. Any less than two paras doesn\u2019t give me enough to reply to, and thus doesn\u2019t interest me. \n\u2022 Discord is my preferred avenue to roleplay, so you must use it!\n\u2022 Faceclaims are necessary for characters. I don\u2019t care what kind you use- so long as it\u2019s not celebrity(realistic, art/drawn, anime)- but you have to use them. The more the better! \n\u2022 I have a lot of ideas but this is a partner story- I need your input! Lots of OOC planning and discussing, twists and turns, I don\u2019t want to carry the story. \n\nThe roleplay will be set in medieval times. Muse A and Muse B will have been married for sometime, a result of an arranged marriage. Muse A was originally meant to marry Muse B\u2019s sibling, but Sibling had already promised marriage to another person. However, in Muse A\u2019s arrangement with Sibling, they were promised the place of king/queen at their side. Since marrying Muse B, they no longer have right to the throne, which is a nightmare in their eyes since they\u2019re a power hungry master-manipulator. \n\nDespite many attempts to woo Sibling, they have no luck getting further up the latter of control, and are stuck being second best. A night of envy and agitation leads Muse A to a rash, but worthy decision. Kill Sibling, promote Muse B, and thus themselves. But this will only work with Muse B\u2019s cooperation. \n\nThere are a TON of ways this can go. My ideal preference is Muse B being manipulated by their partner to kill their own sibling to take the throne. But then, what of Sibling\u2019s betrothed? Will they have to kill them, too? And what of any witnesses who might see the crime? Will this couple be plagued in suspicion and murder forever, even as rulers? In the end, will it all be worth it?\n\nI really hope this catches someone\u2019s eye! If you\u2019re interested, please send me a message, and be sure to let me know any ideas you have! Either Muse is up for the taking, so you have your pick!",

            "selftext": "\nHi there! I\u2019m Cy. I\u2019m in my early thirties with about fifteen years of role playing experience under my belt. My work is very mentally taxing and I\u2019ve been wanting to seek out a couple of partners for long-term, literate RP so I have something fun and creative on the side!\n\n*This isn\u2019t to replace my current partners! I just have too much creative brain this weekend!\n\nSome things about my RP preferences: \n\n-Third person only, I can do past or present tense depending on partner preference but lean toward present. \n\n-I aim for two to three paragraphs per reply, though this can fluctuate according to the scene. \n\n-Activity level will fluctuate as well, depending on my workload, but I try to get a few posts out per week at least! I\u2019m in EST. Time zones don\u2019t really matter much to me though. \n\n-I like a good balance of romance/action/adventure. There has to be a romantic element, but I\u2019m not looking to just write straight slice-of-life. I like a good plot. \n\n-I can write on discord, via email, or Google docs.\n\nWhat I\u2019m looking for in a partner:\n\n-Please be literate. I find it hard to be interested in one-liners. \n\n-Please also be over 18, though over 21 is preferred. \n\n-Help with the plot - I love building a story with my partners, and I find it always goes smoothly when we work on it together! \n\n-If you\u2019re having a block or not interested in the storyline, please let me know so we can either plot something else or skip ahead or whatever needs to be done! \n\n\nOn to the good stuff: \n\nSpecifically looking for Spike to play with my Vicious. I\u2019m just about done watching the Netflix series and I\u2019m loving it - it\u2019s bringing back my long-dormant fixation on the anime. I\u2019d be happy to set it in either universe. We could write something maybe set during their past, or figure out an AU to go forward with. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested, comment or DM me, and we can plot!",

I've already tested this subreddit out and found some cool partners for my Boa scene! 10/10, I must say the partners that I find here are pretty detailed! Well, never the less, today I am looking for something similiar. I am seeking an openminded, detailed, creative and articulate partner to play with! On top of that, you'd need the knowledge of the OP(One Piece) world! I'm currently all caught up with the manga and I'm seeking someone who knows what they are doing, haha.\n\nThe scene itself would be quite simple and will revolve itself on you playing an OC who would be after Nami. He will be an up and coming pirate who would be looking to make a name for himself, and what a better way to do it than to take down Nami? How will he find her? well, I have something in mind, similiar to the Kuma incident that happened in the original story.\n\nI can explain more if you're interested, just DM me! :)",

            "selftext": " Hello all! Growing up I was fascinated by Lord of the Rings and other fantasy RPG type stories and I was hoping to re-create something like that as far as the world goes. The plots can range from romance, to action, to mystery, or any mix of what we can come up with. I would like it to be for a longer RP so story lines can develop, and characters can grow, the action might not come right away. Just a laid back RP that we both can enjoy and be proud of. I have a wide cast of characters and prompts to use.\n\nAs for the writing style I usually write anywhere between 200-500 words at a time in the 3rd person. OOC conversations are very much welcome as we can brainstorm ideas to develop characters and bounce ideas off each other as well as become friends hopefully. Below are some of the titles of example prompts, or come to me with any prompts or scenarios you\u2019d want to try out. Hope to hear from you soon!",

You are the daughter of the world\u2019s most notorious mafia leader. Your father spoiled you and got you whatever you wanted. But life was not all glamorous. After the death of your mother when you were 12 to what your father called a \u201cpreventable tragedy,\u201d your father vowed to never let it happen again. From that day forward you almost always had a bodyguard with you. I was recruited into the mafia when I was 14 and ever since your father has been training me. Eventually your father assigned me to be your bodyguard since we were both roughly the same age. Over the years you and I got to know each other well despite the fact that we grew up completely different lives. You were careless and always wanted to mess around. You viewed every situation as an invite to have a good time. I on the other hand, was trained to take my job seriously and to show little emotion. This was so I could always stay focused.\n2. The city was ruled by two mafia families who despised one another. After a war between the two broke out a few years ago, they decided to split the city in half allowing each to run their own area and hopefully, to reduce the deaths between the two. Only once a year could you see the two mafias under the same roof. That occasion was the annual fundraiser for the Youth Empowerment Program in the city. This year, it was taking place just outside of the city in a giant mansion owned by my family. The theme for this year was a gambling bonanza. The entire house was packed with people and tables for gambling. Getting around was hard, and almost impossible without bumping into people. The only reason why the mafias tolerated each other at this event was because the mayor of the city, and every important political figure, and socialite was there. My father was the leader of one of the mafia families. Up to this year, I tried toa void events like this, but now that I was getting older, my father was making me go as he was preparing me to take over his role in a few years. You were the daughter of the other mafia family\u2019s leader. I had no idea that you existed or that your father even had any children.\n3. I am also down for any unique ideas you have. It does not have to mafia related either, I just watched some Godfather the other day and got motivated.",

I work from home and therefore can usually get multiple replies out during the day. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are numerous plots that I have stored away in my bank of Roleplay ideas, most of them have underlying themes of romance with drama and other things added to keep them interesting. They range from more slice of life ideas into the fantasy or crime / horror genre. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnfortunately I'm not looking to roleplay any Cannon characters, I've always preferred roleplaying an OC. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIdeally my roleplay partner will be happy to help develop a story, provide similar length and detailed responses, multiple times a day (although I know that's not always possible!).

I'm in search of a Inuyasha/Yashahime roleplay, and I'm looking to focus the roleplay around Sesshomaru and Rin's relationship. I'm looking to play Sesshomaru and was hoping I could find someone to play Rin! \n\nI am looking for a partner to give good meaty posts, somewhere between 400 - 600 words per reply, and if you can give more, I would LOVE it! I also require my partner to be over 18+, and even preferred if they were older. It's just a personal preference. I'm also a really laid back, chill person, and I won't be bugging for replies every hour of every day, as I respect and understand that people have responsibilities to handle.  However I'd love to find someone to just gush and be silly in OC chat! I would love to be friends as much as roleplay partners! \n\nI generally roleplay over discord but if you have a preference, please let me know! I'm really a open minded and relaxed gal! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you think we'd make good partners, go ahead and message me! I look forward to hearing from you! :3",

I\u2019m savvy, 27, they/them, and as you probably guessed I\u2019m looking for a roleplay partner to write some fandom shenanigans with.\n\nI\u2019m looking to write as a canon character against either canon or OC. (though OC is preferred) \n\nI do not write with minors. I hope it's obvious, but please take note that all characters must also be 18+. \n\nBecause of my job I won\u2019t be able to be online constantly but my goal always is to reply daily. I write around 1-3 paragraphs and actually prefer 3 to be the max. \n\nI usually do 3rd person and past tense but I am open to trying something else if you\u2019d prefer that. \n\nI really love romance in roleplay but it doesn\u2019t need to be the main thing. \n\nAU and canon. I can do canon story but I would prefer to just use it as a base and build something new around it. Or go completely AU. \n\nFor canon I really don\u2019t have anything specific but AUs? If you don\u2019t mind taking canon characters out of their story I can share my list of cliches. \n\nFinally to the list of fandoms and characters I\u2019d love to write! (thank you for putting up with me if you\u2019re still here)\n\n**Negan** / **Daryl** ( The Walking Dead )\n\n **Leon Kennedy** ( Resident Evil )\n\n**Shaggy Rogers** ( Scooby-Doo )\n\n**Kreacher Pierson** ( Identity V ) \n\n**Takayuki Yagami** ( Judgement ) \n\n**Seven** ( Mystic Messenger )\n\n**Deacon St. John** ( Days Gone ) \n  \nSo! If any of these caught your eye, please feel free to slide right into my dms and say hello. Let me know who you are and what you're looking for! :)",

            "selftext": "\nHi Hi! So I\u2019m making this post as a request for some new and exciting SOL plots based within Tokyo. Mostly I say that because I did just recently make a new character, and she just happens to be from there! I had a few ideas in my mind that were total rough drafts but, I felt a little too embarrassed to post them since they were nowhere near completion. So with that being said, I\u2019d like to go over a few things first just so that anyone who interested knows what to expect!\n\nLength of replies: To be honest, I don\u2019t care too much about reply length as I\u2019ve done very semi-lit, to practically novella style. As long as it\u2019s not back and forth one liners, I\u2019m usually ok with anything that you can provide!\n\nDetail: Same thing applies, just be as detailed as you like/can manage.\n\nGenres: So this will be a Slice of Life plot, but, I would like to throw some action and drama in, considering the location of the story and my characters personal backstory as it\u2019s rather disturbing to some. We can definitely incorporate that into the story if wanted!\n\nAge: I\u2019m over the age of 18 and I expect that for anyone who reaches out, no exceptions.\n\nOoc chat: Be yourself! Don\u2019t be afraid to propose ideas or even strike up a conversation, I tend to be very open and acknowledge most! \n\nCharacters: As my character isn\u2019t completely finished yet, I don\u2019t expect anyone to have a full fledged out character that\u2019s pages long. If you do, then by all means send them! But, as long as the character has some basic information and some pictures to suit, that\u2019s perfect for me!\n\nPlatform: Discord Preferably.\n\nIf you seem interested in a cute or maybe thrilling slice of life plot, send a DM! Can\u2019t wait to see some of you soon!",

            "selftext": "I am in the mood for doing some game of thrones roleplay. One of the interesting things I like about in doing medieval or fantasy setting roleplays is writing about characters from feuding families getting together to explore the different family dynamics and slowly starting to heal the past scars between both parties. Since I am a lover of enemies to lovers trope I greatly enjoy such roleplays as it also opens a lot of opportunities to write a wonderful story.\n\nSome of the couples I could see perfect for this rp are- Aegon Targaryen or Blackfyre and Shireen Baratheon- Personally one of my favorites as it will put an end to the recent Targaryen and Baratheon clash. The idea is pretty basic after the devastating battle for dawn is over and Westeros is littered with corpses and only two legitimate contenders to the Iron throne still alive what if both of them married to unite their claims and prevent more war? We can do about this rp with Young Griff as either the real Aegon Targaryen or as a Blackfyre pretender.\n\nOC son of Robert or Stannis and Rhaenys\ufeff\ufeff Targaryen - Another one of my favorites and the application is the same. Rhaenys\ufeff\ufeff is alive and is betrothed to the new Prince from young age. We could also do something else like having Rhaenys\ufeff\ufeff do some conquering like Daenerys on her pursuit to the iron throne and get crossed with the Baratheon King.\n\nGendry and Rhaenys\ufeff\ufeff Targaryen\n\nEdric Storm and Daenerys Targaryen - Edric meets Daenerys in Essos after being saved by Davos and the others.\n\nTommen Baratheon or Joffrey Baratheon and Shireen Baratheon\n\nTommen Baratheon and Arya Stark - Always been fascinated by this ship. It's cute.\n\nVal and Robb Stark or any other OC Stark since the others are not of age with her\n\nMyrcella Baratheon and Trystane Martell - A Lannister and Martell match to patch up old wounds from the sack of King's Landing.\n\nThat's all I could think of now. I am a literate roleplayer and I expect my partner to be literate as well. Be able to write a nice juicy post of about 3 paragraphs or more. You don't have to keep writing long posts continuously but I expect you to be able to do so. Thank you.",
