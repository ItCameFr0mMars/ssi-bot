            "selftext": "Hello! As the title mentioned, I am looking for a roleplay partner. I used to roleplay for 3+ years before stopping midway through high school. I stopped due to being \u201ctoo busy.\u201d That being said, I am a little rusty from not roleplaying for years so please keep that in mind. \n\nA few things about me: \n\n-My timezone is CDT. Though I do not care about the timezone my partner is in as long as they respond about once a day.\n\n-I am a full-time college student so response sometimes may be lesser on my busier days. I will try to answer 2-3 times a day on weekdays and more often on weekends. At least one response per day. \n\n-I write in the third-person past tense. \n\n-I prefer semi-lit - literate roleplays and typically respond with a few paragraphs depending on the length of responses. If I cannot work off your response, my response will be shorter. \n\n-I prefer to play multiple characters at once. This keeps things interesting for me. \n\n-I prefer playing OCs, but I would not mind someone playing an already created character if that interests them. \n\n-I can play male or female characters. However, if I am playing a male, I prefer to also have a female character as well. I will do MxM, FxF, FxM. Very LGBT+ friendly. \n\nThings I am looking for in a partner: \n\n-1x1\n\n-18+. (If you must know my age, I am 19) \n\n-Must be LGBT+ friendly \n\n-Must be able to respond with a few paragraphs at least. (Sometimes during dialogue-heavy moments, one-liners are alright)\n\n -PLEASE use the third person! I do not care about the tense, but third-person is just a personal preference of mine. \n\n-Someone who is able to play more than one character at a time. \n\n-Open to discussing plots and characters before the roleplay. Also open to talking through the roleplay to push it along. \n\n-I understand that responding sometimes can be hard so as long as my partner communicates with me, I am okay with whatever response time you can manage. \n\nThings I want in RP: \n\n-Romance is a MUST for me. If that is not for you, please disregard this post. \n\n-Do not drag rp on for too long. If RP comes to an end, I want my partner and me to come up with another RP. \n\n-I want our characters to develop and change throughout the RP along with the world we create for them. \n\nThings I will not do in RP: \n\n-Fandoms- I will do select fandom RPs, but all of my characters must be OCs. I will not do a fandom purely on the fact my partner has watched it. \n\n-I will roleplay fantasy aspects if my partner wants to BUT I do not want any overpowered characters, please. \n\nHere are the plots/concepts I\u2019m willing to RP (I am willing to do just about any plot or concepts except for previously mentioned things) \n\nFandoms I\u2019m willing to roleplay- \n\n-The Walking Dead- I would prefer to roleplay the concept rather than the characters if we do this one. I noticed that a lot of people are interested in zombie roleplays on this subreddit so I figured I\u2019d throw this in. If we do end up doing a zombie concept, just know that I haven\u2019t done one before so it may be a little shaky at first but I will try my hardest!\n\n-Criminal Minds- Another fandom that I believe roleplaying the concept may be fun. Perhaps our characters are on a team like the BAU. \n\n-Bridgerton!!!!- With the new season of Bridgerton out, I think it would be a perfect time to roleplay something inspired by it. Historical romance is one of my favorites. Again, this is something I have not roleplayed before so patience would be required but I would love to try\n\nOther plots/concepts: \nAny romance plot. Enemies to lovers, best friends brother, etc. \nDrama,\nMystery,\nHarry Potter adjacent,\nBasically anything! \n\nJust DM me if you are interested, please!",

            "selftext": "Happy Tuesday! Monday has come and gone, and I\u2019m still looking for a long-term female roleplay partner! If you\u2019re out there, don\u2019t be shy and send me a message! \n\nI\u2019d love to find (or maybe they\u2019ll find me) a long-term female roleplay partner! I\u2019m still relatively new to this subreddit, and I\u2019d love a partner who wouldn\u2019t ghost me, and want to do many roleplay scenarios with me! First, I\u2019ll share what I\u2019m looking for in a roleplay partner, and then I\u2019ll share a few ideas I have with you! Are you ready? Let\u2019s get into the exciting stuff! \n\nCommunication: If you\u2019re not going to add to the plot daily then please don\u2019t send me a message. I want to get to know you better for more than just the roleplay aspect of it as well. I think roleplay is so much better when you\u2019re able to have a connection to the person you\u2019re talking with! \n\nAge- I\u2019m an adult so please be one as well. It\u2019s as simple as that :) I have no interest in roleplaying with minors. \n\nPlot Requirements- I don\u2019t have too many of these, but please be able to contribute more than one-line responses. I could easily write a few paragraphs for each response, especially if the plot is on fire! Those are the best plots, right?\n\nIdeas- Here are some of the ideas I have in mind, and I\u2019d love to hear yours as well: Best Friends, Co-Workers (many different directions we could go with that one), \nSwiping Right, Trainer &amp; Client, Neighbors, Realtor &amp; Client, Therapist &amp; Patient, Secret Admirer, Strangers, Enemies Turn Into Lovers, Biggest Fan, First Date, Instant Attraction, and Tutor &amp; Student. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in any of these ideas then feel free to send a message my way. I\u2019m excited to see what we can come up with together! I\u2019m only looking to roleplay with women so please keep that in mind.",

You should be at least semi literate. I like to read whole sentences and replies that are something around the length discord allows you to and I am fine with discord or reddit.\n\nI adjust my replies to match your length unless i am very motivated which can result in more detailed and longer replies.\n\n\n- LGBTQ+ friendly.\n\n- I can write m or f but I am mostly used to writing the m characters.\n\n- comfortable with pretty much everything FxF(i don't really have experience with this one) FxM MxM.\n\n- might double up\n\n- ooc talk is fine with me\n\n- regarding ships, let's just discuss that between us, there are not many ships which i would refuse to write but a lot whith wich i am not that experienced yet.\n\n\nI understand that not everyone has time to reply multiple times a day, so i am very much fine with one reply per day.\n\nMissing a day is no problem, although i might not like to continue if you just ghost me or vanish for two weeks without notice.\n\n\nBasically everything is open for discussion as I want us both to enjoy the roleplay as much as possible.\u00a0\n\n\nShips that I write about currently include mostly Albedo, Zhongli, Tartaglia, Xiao and Aether on my part.\n\nSo if you're looking for something in this direction i'd love to write with you.

            "selftext": "About me:\nSo I'm a 23f english literature uni student (UK), I want to try improve my writing more on the side whilst I do the degree.\n\nBefore I start: these are mostly preferences unless marked with a * so I am flexible.\n\nChar &amp; background:\nI have a set of OC's I would really like to evolve more and have a preference for people who have/design their own OCs rather than pre-written characters. I am, however, happy to put the setting in fandoms: particularly fantasy e.g. skyrim/witcher 3/lotr etc.\nI dont mind discussing or making a setting and lore of our own.\n\nSFW content:\n18+ only BUT I would rather avoid any s xual content in any detail*, I don't mind implications of things happening but anything deeper can't be on the table for personal reasons - for more info message me. Any other 18+ content is fine e.g. things that require TWs.\n\nReplies:\nI work part-time irregularly and have uni so please be advised I may take a week to reply if its an especially busy week, though sometimes it may only take a few hours. Since my work is nights and uni is days my schedule shifts a lot so don't worry if your timezone is polar to mine, I'll be up for each equally.\n\nPreferences:\nFully literate so please try give at least 2 paragraphs**; I dont mind how long it takes you to reply. I'm happy doing any LGBTQ themes. Open to rp on Instagram or discord or other apps rather than reddit.\n\nSide note:\nMy preference is to play M if it's regarding OC's but if you have a preference for what you want my char to be then let me know and it'll be fine. I do have an original fantasy plot ready if need be.\n\nInterests:\nOCs/original universes. Skyrim. Witcher 3. Fantasy. LOTR. British period dramas. Vikings. The last kingdom. Archer. Anime (I've seen a lot so I'm leaving this open ended). I play a lot of ps4 rpg games and watch a lot of shows so just sort of let me know if theres something else you want to try and if ive seen it we can work on that.",

My style of writing includes multi-paragraph works varying from 1st Person POV to 3rd Person POV.  I've been in a hiatus for a while, but I'm starting to come back out of my shell and dive back into the world of roleplaying. Here is some pertinent RP partner info below:\n\nTimezone: Eastern Standard Time (EST)\n\nReply Frequency: \nI try to reply at least a couple times a day, though it depends on my schedule. I'm currently a college student, but I have a decent amount of time to dedicate to roleplaying. \n\nA few of my interests include...\n\n\u25aa\ufe0e Fantasy and Sci-Fi genres \n\u25aa\ufe0e Star Wars \n\u25aa\ufe0e Borderlands/Mad Max\n\u25aa\ufe0e Marvel MCU \n\u25aa\ufe0e Teen Titans\n\u25aa\ufe0e Avatar: The Last Airbender \n\u25aa\ufe0e Demon Slayer\n\u25aa\ufe0e and more! Just ask. \n\nRomance:\nI'm all for making things a little spicy. I love adding romance to a story, and I enjoy writing from cutesy fluff to full-on 50 Shades of Grey but as long as it's all in good taste. I.e, not the sole purpose of the story. \n\nSo you've managed to skim through my ad- what do you think? If you're interested in starting up a story with me, please send a message my way! DMs or Reddit Chat function is the main way to contact me as I don't usually see comments.",

She is a celeb but not quite as known. \n\nThe characters will be me , her as the mom and maybe I could have a brother or sister. I would love if you guys could play multiple people maybe just 2 or 3 \n\nIn the rp i could be her son or even stepson if you would like because im ok with both. She is a single mom as her husband had passed away a few years ago leaving her to take care of us on her own. This will just be a normal slice of life rp and there will be no sex as it\u2019s a family rp. We will go through challenges and have some ups and downs. If I do have brothers and sisters  I will be the oldest. I will be a teenager that\u2019s not a good child and that doesn\u2019t listen but I will some times\n\nI would love to rp this and I would like if you could have an input as well , as I don\u2019t want to be carrying the rp. You can do any ideas of your own as I love when my rp partner gets involved and takes control in the rp sometimes. \n\nI write in 1st person and I will also feed pics of the celeb throughout the rp.

In this roleplay I'm looking for drama, romance, and everything else that happens in high school. I want this to be set in a well built world, so world building is important.\u00a0\n\n\nThis could start in many different ways, a new student arrives during the year? Maybe a new high school just opened and it's the start of a new year with all new classmates? And anything else our brains can think off!\n\n\nI play on discord so please have an account. I'm not the person who writes the most, I try to write one paragraph or more reply, and I hope you can do the same.\u00a0\n\n\nSo I hope to hear from you all very soon!\u00a0",

I have several ideas - I will be playing the role of the DM, running the world while you will be playing the perspective of one main character + your own side characters to add to the story. \n\nHere are some of the prompts:\n\n* Young officers in the academy, about to graduate before an outbreak of a war (coming of age, rise to prominence)\n* A revolution threatens to topple an ancient dynasty - you are part of the Last Guard (tragic)\n* A small nation is wedged between two powerful nations. You will be playing an important part in determining the fate of a nation. (political, intrigue)\n* You are part of a legion sent to foreign lands. Something has happened and your communication is cut, you must find a way back (adventure, exploration)\n\nIf you are interested, hit me up in the DMs - we can discuss things and if we vibe we can get things set up. I do prefer using Discord as it allows me to set up various channels. Has to be in the 3rd person!",

Not all of them are the same ago tho. The oldest one created an academy where these magical children could learn how to use their powers. When they arrive at the school, they usually already have a basic understanding of their powers, so they are first lead to a room in which there are a lot of weapons/artifacts that enhance your magic (usually made from monster bones). A weapon/artifact will then choose you, not the other way around, and that will be the item you will use for combat or whatever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have a basic idea for my character.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI prefer to rp on discord, but anything is fine\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDM me or comment if you are interested!",

            "selftext": "I originally was gonna title this \"hyperactive imagination megadrive\", but I decided against it when I realized that wouldn't really get my point across. Also, I'd like to mention that I want to write wholly original stuff instead of roleplaying off of something already existing. I do enjoy several fandoms, that you can feel free to ask about, so it would be fine if we brought ideas from them and gave them our own spin to make it feel even more creative.\n\nComing off from that: Hi.\n\nI'm looking for a new partner to play with. I have a couple scenarios and plots I've thought of already, and I love discussing ideas, as a consequence, I also enjoy it when my partner is proactive with their own ideas. We could take turns asking/answering questions about what we think and what we want to add before we start playing. As mentioned with the old title, I have somewhat of a hyperactive imagination, so we can build a whole world with lore, and creatures, and make it feel lived in together. Ideally, I'd like to spend some time planning the setting and the story, maybe a couple hours or days. Also, I really enjoy planning several power systems that all combine to make for some amazing shows of actions during the role, so be ready to plan for that as well. I'll wait for you if you get busy, just let me know if you get busy for over a week so I won't keep asking.\n\nFrom there, let me discuss how I like playing:\n\n1. I can write anywhere from 100 to 2000+ words if you make me feel invested. And I will do my best to keep you engaged as well.\n2. Typically, I reply in less than an hour since I work from home and it's a slow job. If you can't or if you're busy, I understand and I'll give you time.\n3. I play in third person, since I really enjoy playing multiple characters. I would also appreciate it if you did too, both parts.\n4. I enjoy action and adventure with some mystery to tie everything together, and some comedy here and there. Romance is perfectly fine, but I'd prefer it if the role didn't primarily focus on that.\n5. I prefer roleplaying on Discord. Makes it easy to keep everything organized.\n\nAnd here's just a couple plots so you can get an idea of what kind of role I'd like to do (bare in mind, we don't need to *these,* but we *can* if you want to):\n\n1. We work at a shop that specializes in items of the arcane variety. Our work is testing, studying and making sure the items are in sellable condition. The shop regularly receives simple magic items like a never-ending bottles of wine, or several collections of talking books, but from time to time, we do get to test drive swords capable of time travel, a pair of gloves that allow teleportation, and much more.\n2. In a desert world with few settlements scattered about, scavenging has been outlawed due to the alarming rate at which parties that devolved into pure pillaging. The scavengers that remain are seen as rebels, and people admire them for them bravery and willingness to live a life of adventure. Following that same life of adventuring and discovery, you decide to steal a sand glider and make your way out into the big world. Now you only need the most important thing, a party to adventure with!\n\nIf you're interested in building something together, or if you like those little examples, feel free to DM me. Thanks a bunch for reading this. ***Have a nice day.***",

I\u2019m also ok with one liners if it\u2019s just to move the story along. \n\nSo post apocalyptic! I\u2019ve been wanting to do one for a while now and think I might have an idea for it. Of course we don\u2019t have to do mine and can always do something else that\u2019s post apocalyptic. I\u2019m hoping for there to be a lot of world building as well as managing resources and stuff. Although I will say I have never done a roleplay where we managed resources but I\u2019ll give it a shot. Of course we don\u2019t have to. Anyways our ocs can already know each other or not there\u2019s a lot of possibilities. \n\nIf all that seems cool with you please let me know and I\u2019ll send over the plot I have when it comes to how the world ended up dead. Like I said I\u2019m open to any and all ideas! Oh! I also only roleplay on discord so if that\u2019s a no go I\u2019m very sorry about that",

Also I mainly use discord.  I\u2019ve been roleplaying for around 10 years and I usually match my effort given during a roleplay with whoever I\u2019m roleplaying with.  I have a few different plots in mind. A Star Wars OC based Rp, a fantasy OC based Rp, and a few others. I hope to see some takers for these rps.",

            "selftext": "\nHello everyone ! . I have been roleplaying for the past two years. I have a very fluid writing pattern and can generally adapt to any writing length, although I generally set the limit as somewhere between three to six paragraphs depending on the scene. I enjoy ooc chatting very much and would love to befriend my rp partners and believe that it helps in the smooth run of the story in the long term, as well. I write in third person past tense, generally although that\u2019s definitely modifiable with the right partner. I also try to atleast reply a couple of times a day  and will keep you posted on any and all changes which might affect our rp or my posting schedule.\n\nNow as for my partners  I am seeking anyone willing to write male characters . I have a preference towards FxM/MxM pairings although I\u2019m open to try out FxF as well. I don\u2019t have any strict expectations when it comes to grammar and capitalisation and stuff, as long as it is comprehensible that\u2019s all that matters. You are expected to be 18+ and atleast try to match with me in terms of replies. I am not a fan of one liners. Also please be involved in the plotting process. I prefer to write over discord.\n\nNow moving on to the prompts. I like to write nuanced and layered characters. I emphasise a lot on character arcs and developments throughout the story. I also include a wide array of side characters to make sure the story remains engaging and compelling. I also love writing heavy themes and incorporate them into the stories. My preferred genres include drama, romance and horror.\n\nThe epic love triangle:\n\nThis prompt would focus on three primary characters. Muse A and Muse B have been married for years on end but had to end up splitting because of \u2018reasons\u2019 but they very much still have feelings. Now Muse C, gets involved in both the characters lives. Muse C might be a doctor, psychiatrist, colleague, etc\u2026. Muse C slowly starts to develop feelings for Muse A and as they start \u2018dating\u2019 Muse C simultaneously develops a friendship with Muse c. This would be the base conflict of the entire story. What would happen when Muse A discovers his girlfriend and ex-wife are friends? What would happen to their friendship? Who would they choose? This particular prompt will involve a lot of angst and drama. In this situation I would be writing for Muse B and Muse C. \n\nChildhood friends (crime) \n\nLife can be very cruel. Life can be very generous to some of us. What happens when two childhood friends who parted ways ten years ago find themselves in the opposite ends of a cat and mouse game. Muse A is a detective who goes undercover to take down a notorious criminal. And who would they be? That\u2019s completely upto you. Will Muse A Ditch the police and go along her childhood friend? Will she pretend to fall in love with him only to get him to confess? What happens when she realises that she is in love with him after handing him over to the cops? What happens when ghosts from their past come back to haunt them \n\nChildhood friends (drama)\n\nTwo souls clearly meant to be together but the timing doesn\u2019t always work out. Set in a conservative town, this story follows our characters from high school throughout the rest of their life. They have been best friends all their lives. They have buried feelings for each other for a long time. When they finally give in to Their temptations it\u2019s too late. One of them goes to college and the other? That\u2019s upto you. Maybe they enrol in the army? They turn out to be an Emt? They go to another college in another country? The story follows the duo throughout their lives using flash towers and time jumps. Do they truly belong together?\n\nA demonic love story:\n\n\u2018Meant to be\u2019. Or atleast that is what she was told by her friends until she gets possessed one day. This prompt follows a couple, consisting of Muse A and B. Muse B had a very tough upbringing, she had made questionable choices. She had done things she would rather not tell her husband. When she gets possessed her husband is forced to figure out what has happened and why this had happened? Will their love withstand this? Will Muse B ever be back to normal. Maybe Muse A isn\u2019t as innocent as he seems to be. Is he the reason for her possession? \n\nThat\u2019s pretty much all I have got. If you have made it this far, thank you. If you would rather come up with a completely new prompt altogether and collaborate I am open to that as well. Or if you have any prompts from any genre, dropped role plays you would like to revive, then I\u2019m your gal. Can\u2019t wait to hear from you!",

I have been roleplaying since like five years now and have tried almost every genre. \n\nSo today I am looking to find a roleplay partner for one specific fandom. That is Batman. I always loved batman and I re-watched the recent batman movies and now I badly want to do a roleplay around it.\n\nI am pretty open to play any gender, but for this roleplay I want to play the Dark Knight himself, and I am looking for someone to play a female character against the Batman. You can play an OC or Canon, totally upto you.\n\nMy schedule gets weird sometimes, but I usually respond quick. If I get busy, I would let my partner know.     If you don't like something, just tell me instead of disappearing.\n\n**My writing preferences**: I prefer to write in third person and past tense. My writing style varies from semi-literate to novella, so yeah my average post length is around three to five paragraphs but it really depends on the context. I can play multiple characters and it would be a bonus if you can too. \n\n**Genres I would like to explore in this roleplay:**\n- Action \n- Drama\n- Romance \n- Mystery \n- Crime\n\n*Note: It's not necessary to include everything.*\n\nSo yeah I am open to brainstorm, I have some plots too. My ideal version of batman is the Ben Affleck's version, some might not agree with me but that's just what I like. If you are going to message, please put some effort in it.  \n\nMy DMs are open, feel free to message.I only roleplay on discord.",

Otherwise, I'm very open to finding a middle ground and would love to hear your ideas, and maybe even something you've wanted to try that proteins to the fantasy course I've been wanting to take. New ideas are always fun, and building the surrounding world is always very fun as well, because it's strictly our world and our rules, no one else's\ud83d\ude04\n\n So, if fantasy is something your interested in, don't be afraid to send me a chat or a PM. Also, let me know what your favorite flavor of sucker is, just so I know you've at least read this far. Look forward to hearing from you, and have a wonderful day!!",

I will give you my two ideas and the choice is yours:\n\n- you're another teacher sent to the village from the city, with whatever backstory you may come up with. You've been teaching them basic maths, while my character will teach them literature. Being that your character was there for a while she'll be able to provjde a link between my character and the village.\n\n- you're the daughter of the chief of the village. While you are the most educated person in the village, you are still semi-illiterate. Though, you're very much used to nature, the wildlife and many life skills which my character lacks. So you will strike a deal with my character to teach you enough to be fully literate, aside from his job with the children, with your part if the deal being to teach him survival and life skills, and introduce him to the village's traditions.",

            "selftext": "Hi. So it's been a while since I posted. But...I decided to try again after taking a break from roleplay. I am literate and like long-term roleplays. Anyway here are a few ideas. If you have any, let me know. \nI'm also really into Hawkeye at the moment so if anyone wants to play him while I be Kate Bishop I would love that. Or his wife. Or Black widow. I could be any of those. But I'm really into an agegap thing right now. Anywho...\n1. Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy: This would be thier relationship basically. We can go where we want to with this.\n2. Tony Stark x Pepper Potts: I'm thinking this is after Morgan. I would love to see more of thier family life.\n3. Peter Parker x MJ: this is the newest version I prefer. It could be before or after Mays death depending on how much angst you want it to have. \n4. Wolverine x Rogue: I would love to explore that. It can be movie or comic version. \n5. Kitty x Iceman\n6. Kitty x nightcrawler\n7. Mystique x magneto\n8. Charles Xavier x Mystique\n9. Charles Xavier x Jean grey. \nAny other pairings you can think of let me know.\nAs for DC I am open. But I love Titans. So.. ya. Let me know. \nMy slice of life idea is a little different. It's the relationship between a musician and his fan. So all the ins and outs of that. If you want to know more let me know. Thanks for reading so far. If you did type \"Dance\" in the first line of your response so I know you read it all. Thanks again!",

I\u2019ve got an idea for a role but it\u2019s pretty new. As for characters I like it when my partner chooses the look and traits to fit what they like.\n\nBasically it can be set in older times or we can modernize it. We are apart of a royal family. From a young age your family and mine has been relatively close.\nI was the youngest with a brother and a sister. You were a single child. We got along better and when I turned 18 our relationship grew into more. It only lasted a year when you turned 22 and it was set in stone to marry my oldest sister. It was only right, so both or kingdoms grew stronger and stayed safe. But you didn\u2019t love her, and she loved that she took what mattered to me. I withdrew from the family, rarely showed to events. One night our paths crossed after a ball celebrating your one year anniversary. I was in the library and you found it as an escape to all the questions about when you will bring an heir to the throne. Do we let the flame rekindle? Or do I continue on my downward spiral while you pretend I don\u2019t exist\n\nI believe I have a few other roles, I\u2019ll have to check. If this one doesn\u2019t spark your interest, but it\u2019s mostly romance type themes. I\u2019d love to hear any ideas you have too. See if we can be a good fit and create a great storyline.",

            "selftext": "Hello, how is everyone doing? This is basically a summary of the real post because I have no idea which parts of it make it be autoremoved \ud83d\ude05.\n\nAnyways, the plot is the next: In the distant future where humanity is at war with an alien threat, a ship went missing after an encounter gone wrong. Unbeknownst to everyone, this ship was not destroyed as many believed but it made its way to an uncharted system. Said system had a planet that could harbor life and the that's where the ship made its fiery entrance and such a fireball coming from the heavens might have been seen by most of those that lived in the world. The humanoid aliens (imagine fantasy species with extra exotic features to make them more alien like, maybe more than one species live in the world) that called that world home, who might be taller in size than normal (at max 20 ft and at min 7 ft, we could discuss this) now had the course of their history changed after the strange object from the heavens made its fall.\n\nNow, the survivor (Maybe more in the future) has to find a way to survive in that alien realm, without knowing that it was inhabited by towering aliens that have medieval technology at best, though they could have something they call 'magic', which to the humans would be nothing else but the psionic powers they themselves have in the distant future. Perhaps with his tools and psionic abilities, the survivor would have a better chance of wandering safely across the world but then again, it is unknown if the alien beings have psionic powers of their own. What is known, however, is that they are at least stronger than a regular Human, thanks to their height.\n\nSo, this story should be mostly a plot based story. We'll have to do some worldbuilding first to come up with something original and great that we can both enjoy. It would be a long term adventure/discovery type of roleplay with perhaps some mystery elements and whatever we consider is a good idea to add.\n\nI am looking an at least semi literate partner with lots of creativity that is comfortable with playing the natives of the world, since I'll be playing the human(s). Also, only 18 years or older because i am 24. Maybe we could rp through dm's or discord, maybe. Send me a DM if you are interested in this post!\n\nIn case someone wants to read the full ad/background, this is what i wrote and tried to summarize:\n\n*In the year 3550, humanity established a huge civilization in the Orion Arm of the Milky Way. Unchallenged for millenia by nobody else but themselves, they grew and grew in power. Wherever they went, they always looked for other species to call friends. However, they haven't had any luck yet.*\n\n*The human race learned from their mistakes made ages ago, mistakes about war and hatred so weaponry was slowly turning into a thing of the past. They weren't prepared for what they were looking for since they looked at the stars...Other people from outside the Orion Arm came with a huge armada to one of the outer colonies. The humans, thinking they were peaceful, opened communication with them. That was a huge mistake. These aliens, what humanity thought would be their friends in the darkness, were nothing but a bunch of savages. System after system began falling against their advances and it'll be years since humanity could remember how much practice they had against themselves.*\n\n*Years after first contact, a reversal happened, Humanity was winning for the first time and winning brutally, like they always do. NOw, in the current time, we find our main character: A psionic human soldier that was on a patrol sent to take over one of the enemy's worlds. The battle was brutal, and a terrible accident happened...The aliens were prepared for them. So, when the humans tried to retreat, an overload in the main reactor of the ship our main character was messed up the FTL transition. Almost everyone died after that accident. The ship, though, came through the other side. What awaited the survivors was something they didn't expect: Another planet was in front of them and it looked inhabitable, one that was already pulling them towards it thanks to its gravity. The crashlanding was the last straw and from the remaining survivors, only the psionic soldier survived.*\n\n*Down there on the world below, the locals would see during one fateful night a bright star appear out of a sudden, one that seemed to be growing bigger and bigger as the time passed, until one day, a bright shooting star took its place, yet this shooting star wouldn't just pass through the sky but come down towards them, somewhere far away. Clearly, it was an omen of things to come or perhaps a gift from the gods for all they knew.*\n\n*Down on the ground, civilizations have thrived for who knew how long; although, of course, they were still young in terms of technological progress. However, something more mysterious could be found there if someone were to properly explore the land and that something was nothing more than ruins of ages past. Still, these ruins were not the regular buildings made of ancient stone or similar materials, no, these ancient buildings were made of something that would be more familiar to the lost survivor, something more...metallic and advanced. The natives treated said buildings as the ruins of the precursors or, perhaps, as the temple of the ancient gods that once walked amongst them and guided them in their infancy.*\n\n*The knowledge about said ruins, the true knowledge, however, got lost across the many generations and nobody knew of their real purpose, not even the human would even recognize that at first glance, but of course how could he, if he's but a lost alien in an unknown world? What nobody knows, though, is that the lost Human is not an alien at all, no, for it was his people the one that made those ruins countless millennia ago. Ruins whose real purpose was to sustain a bustling civilization of Humans, ones that would be the reason this exotic and beautiful world exists in the first place. How could that be possible, however? Well, the answer is not that complicated: The ship was not lost for just a few hours...*",

            "selftext": "**This is based off the 2021 Sony game \u201cGhost of Tsushima\u201d, and possibly its branching Iki storyline. Some type of knowledge of this game would be heavily preferred.**\n\n25 years after Khotun Khan failing to capture Tsushima Island, peace begins to fracture. Several bandit groups and raiders are beginning to band together, hoping to accomplish what the Mongol leader could not. The fractured samurai left on the island send for mainland reinforcements, hoping to quell this \u201crebellion\u201d before it gets out of hand. One day, several reports of conquered raider camps all have one thing in common. The Ghost has returned\u2026\n___\n\n\nHeya! After getting back into the game, I came up with a rather interesting story idea that would be rather fun to roleplay, and said idea has a tiny bit of Mulan added in. Jin Sakai\u2019s daughter is continuing her father\u2019s legacy of The Ghost of Tsushima. She will be trying to help defeat the raiders, but will also be trying to hide from the mainland samurai, who still consider the Ghost, and anyone who goes by that title, to be an outlaw. Another idea I had received would be that the raiders would be secretly backed by the Mongols, who hope to weaken Tsushima forces before attempting a second invasion.\n\nI am *more* than happy to receive any suggestions or comments about this idea while we discuss the roleplay. The above paragraph isn\u2019t something I\u2019m set on. It\u2019s more or less a starting point for us to come up with an idea we would both enjoy.\n\nI am incredibly flexible with roleplaying in regards to first/third person. When it comes to length, the more interested in the rp I am, the more I\u2019ll tend to write. I have gone past the 2,000 character limit for discord a couple times, based on the prompt. My only request is that you provide enough detail for what the current situation requires. If two characters are just standing and talking, then involve details of them possibly fidgeting, or their thoughts as well.\n\nMy time zone is EST, but I am often up late at night to rp and talk. I do work, mainly in the afternoon/evening, but it is rather sporadic.\n\nThank you so much for reading through this brick of a post, and please let me know if you\u2019d like to roleplay! Feel free to send a message, or a chat if you are interested.",

            "selftext": " \n\nLooking for someone to roleplay a setting where we are residents in a village that was forgotten by society. Could be a modern setting or an older setting, it's entirely up to discussion. There are horror elements, gothic elements, and maybe some science fiction. (When I say science fiction I mean like, aliens and other worldly beings.)\n\nMy character is a single woman, her early 30s, who lives at the edge of the village. She chose to live in this particular house, because it belonged to her parents. After her parents passed away and her husband died from a freak accident, she took the home back, and lives with what remains. What remains may be the spirits of the dead or her over-active imagination.\n\nI haven't roleplayed anything serious in a very long time so I may be a bit rusty. To start, I can do up to a paragraph per post with the possibility to make it more later down the road when the story starts to get fleshed out. But for now, I would like to keep at semi-paragraph per post to get the flow going. I prefer 3rd person but I can do 1st and I would also prefer if the writing was in private messages here on Reddit and anything discussed out of character can be done through chats. If you're interested then please feel free to send me a chat message and give some info on a character you'd be writing for.\n\nA short horror about a village in the middle of a dark woods that is hiding a secret. Is it their religion, their traditions and refusal to modernize themselves with the outside world, or is it something much worse?\n\n1. The village is isolated. It is settled on top of a plateau and the only means of entering or leaving was a bridge that has since been destroyed by severe weather.\n2. The residents of the village are aware that there is an outside world, but have no desire to try and make contact. A possible reason that there has not been any attempt to rebuild the bridge.\n3. There is a supernatural/paranormal force within the village. Some say it is God, some say it is The Devil. Others say that it could be fumes from the abandoned mine causing hallucinations or that the village elders are poisoning the main water supply to keep people in a state of confusion.\n4. Though they don't keep direct contact with the outside world, the village elders are said to have a contract that sees new people dropped off at the bridge, on the village side, by helicopter every six months. These people are said to be homeless, runaways, vagrants, etc., and when they arrive they have no recollection of their former lives. However, there is an occasional moment where these people will remember things, which then causes seriously painful debilitative headaches that sees them blacking out. When they come to, they forget that memory again.\n5. Vampires, werewolves, man-bats, witches, gnomes, fairies, trolls and ghosts exist. The only half-human/half-animal beings are Werewolves and Man-Bats. No other hybrids exist.\n\nON A SIDE NOTE, I AM ALSO INTERESTED IN ASSASSIN'S CREED RP, HARRY POTTER RP, OR ANY OTHER POST-APOCALYPTIC/ZOMBIE TYPE RP.",

            "selftext": "\nNew plot idea. I am a 21 male going to play as a female or male character. I have this idea for a type of zombie apocalypse plot. This one will be a different one than most would be used to. This will be set into the future. When I say future i don\u2019t mean lasers, hovering cars, or such. What I mean is there are normal modern day firearms. The railroad has taken a huge leap in advancement. Through a international business, a majority of world has been connected by railways through a connection of Russia and America via the Bering Strait. Next, the creations of VI and restrained AI has helped manage the worlds businesses. VIs help run small businesses and basic functions of larger ones. AIs help run the world through human interactions such as HR, checkout, waitresses, and such. AI have been also been given nanny positions, school teachers, and small leadership positions for a non biased standpoints. \n\nNow here\u2019s where my plot majorly comes in. My character is on a train. They live on the train that has several different attachments on it. Including food, sleeper, Rec, engine, and a few modified ones that help them survive. My character makes runs for weapons and munitions. With the help of VI and AI, the world still runs with power, food and water. So the only threat is the immediate threat of the dead.  \n\nI am a 21 y/o male who role plays on Discord. I like to use a 3 paragraph reply but I choose quality over quantity. I won\u2019t correct you for your grammar or spelling mistakes. I work nights in the MST. I don\u2019t hound for no responses i understand life happens and takes first in life. I ask you feel the same. Thank you.",

I would like to start off by saying that I don't have a concrete plot just yet since it's a tickle so far. But I do have an idea of what sort of concepts I'd like to do. \n\nRules: \n\n1) If interested, please provide a writing sample. It has to be at least one paragraph long. Can be of anything. \n\n2) 20+ please \n\n3) Double up required \n\n4) Third person past tense. Detailed. No one liners or self inserts. \n\n5) As for pairings, I prefer to do M x F. But MxM and F xF is fine by me! \n\n6) Not comfortable roleplaying with men. \n\n\nPLOT\n\nI don't have a set plot JUST yet, but I do like the concept of having someone from the high society get involved with someone that is from a lower class. \n\nWe can also have a plot where one of the characters is not who they say they are? We can have it start off with the character going into deceiving the other, but as time goes on, they realize that things spiraled way out of their control. \n\nIf you have any questions, let me know!!",

I want **you** to wrote a fantasy role play together. Do you want to? Of course you do!\n\nThe idea is a simple one\u2026 just kidding! It\u2019s a pretty complex one, and actually I\u2019ve the world set up, not the idea. I am pretty happy with the world I\u2019ve got though. It\u2019s reasonably in-depth &amp; provides sufficient context, backstory, &amp; information for the world (with more specific information available on request).\n\nEssentially, the idea is the classic fantasy world: mountains, deserts, rivers, ravines, princesses, weapons, magic, &amp; religions. You\u2019re free to make your own character for it - we can and hopefully will discuss that, of course - and *will* be given freedom within the confines of the world to write your character(s) how you want and, just as importantly, where you want.\n\nMake sure to message me if you okay D&amp;D because you all seem to be the very, very best at this sort of thing. Sone people take this super literally as a requirement or something but like, if you\u2019re interested\u2026 message me?\n\nPlease, please, please, be a detailed &amp; passionate writer &amp; world builder!\n\nDiscord is much preferred - thank you!\n\nJust to be doubly clear as there seems to be sone confusion: I **do** already have the world thought &amp; written up.",

            "selftext": "This RP will be Action and Romance Focused (most likely). We can and likely will add more to it as we go along. Things can be changed and edited if you would like that, and I am always down to add more if it is needed.\n\n.\n.\n.\n\nIn this world, things known as \"Gates'' appear. These phenomena are strange, as no one knows where they came from or why they are here. These gates contain powerful monsters beyond your most horrible nightmares. Well, the higher level gated at least. These gates rank from E to D to C to B to A to S, and their difficulty is judged by the monsters inside of the gate, including the final boss. Why not leave the gates alone, you may think? Well, if they are left alone, then the monsters can get out into the world and attack and destroy everything and everyone they can find. Now, in a world like this, what is humanity to do? Well, due to the appearance of gates, humans have suddenly gained the capability to become what are known as hunters. These hunters are humans with magic inside of them. This magic can grant them many capabilities. Some may be assassins, wielding knives and fighting with a more sneaky style. You could be a mage, able to summon creatures or shoot fireballs. You possibly could be a healer, who has magic to heal anything from the minor-est wounds to regrowing limbs. The only problem is, you have a rank as well.\n\nJust like the gates, hunters are ranked from E to S in their levels. E Rank is the most common, with very little magic, and usually they lack any skill or class. Whereas S, the strongest rank, has magic that is incapable of being measured by humans. These people can possibly take on the entire military by themselves, so many can get away with many things. Now, if you are E-Rank, would it not be better to stay at home and let the bigger fish take care of it? Well, inside of Dungeons, you can find loot from Magic Crystals to Mana Gems that can be sold for money. Not only that, but you can join a guild who will PAY you to do the gates. Not only this either, but stronger guilds even hire mining teams and harvesting teams to come in after they kill all the normal enemies and gather all the loot and all the monster corpses. But in this world, many can and do get injured. Whether it be by other hunters while inside gates, to monsters injuring you while you fight. Training? Only helps you a little bit. The amount of magic energy you are born with is what you are stuck with... At least, that is what everyone believes.\n\nNow, meet our protagonist, Shiro Kurosaki. A Japanese E-Rank Hunter. Not only that but he has the lowest magical amount in all of recorded history. The world ridicules him, and he simply moves on. He has no weapon because he can't afford one on an E-Rank Salary. The only Dungeons he can really do are E-Rank Dungeons! And he can't even really fight in those! But, he tries harder than anyone else. However, everything would change when he entered the Dungeon on his 19th Birthday. It was a normal E-Rank Dungeon, low level monsters, Shiro getting hurt while his squad mostly dealt with the monsters. However, after slaying the boss, they came across a strange door. After his Squad wanted to enter, Shiro followed, and the place they entered would forever change everything for him. Inside were giant stone statues, and instructions written almost like bible verses. And in the center sat a giant statue. Quickly, members of the party began to be injured.\n\nFirst, for not kneeling, next, for not moving into the right positions for \"Worship\". One by one, they were injured badly, until only Shiro remained. Having tried to help as much as he could, he watched as stone statues approached him with their weapons drawn. All he could think about was his mother and his sister. He was going to get hurt, and that was what truly scared him. Crying out, he grabbed a weapon nearby and charged forward, knowing it was futile. There was nothing he could do. But right when he was slashed by a giant stone blade, Shiro woke up in a hospital bed... He and his party had been found outside a dungeon, and brought to a hospital to heal. However, what had happened was not dumb luck. As a screen appeared before him, reading. \"WELCOME PLAYER\"... His New Life and a New Discovery... Would begin. One that would not only change Shiro's life, but the lives of all those he interacted with. The \"Double Dungeon\" incident, as it would later be called, brought about the birth of a new person. Shiro became what he thought was the first person to ever be able to increase his power as a hunter! Although, what he would soon be calling \"The System\", would not make it easy for him.\n\n.\n.\n.\n\nHey, thanks for reading! Hopefully, this plot will be a long term one, and we can have a lot of fun with it! This RP is an open world we can choose to play around with! Our characters being the focus of it, of course! Now, your character is something we will have to discuss and figure out. Will she be a player too? Perhaps an S-Rank Warrior who ends up taking an interest in a Hunter whose abilities are growing? We can figure it all out together of course!! That is the fun of the RP!!\n\nNow, I am willing to do this here, or other places if you would prefer it. I would like someone who can match me in my detail, although we can discuss that in DM/PM! Which you should not hesitate to do, by the way! Also, make sure to send me a link to this post for me to know... And open the convo with something more than \"Hey\"\n\nAnyway, once again, thank you for reading. Have a good day/afternoon/night!",

A litany of furrows and ridges that resembled interconnected cracks lining a scorched wasteland, tufts of close-cropped, salt and pepper-colored hair, and a callow, mischievous glint synonymous with hypnotic hazels permeated his handsome, wizened visage. The gentleman's sprightly, yet guttural intonation was hoarse due to the decreased timbre of advanced age, not to mention the corollary of neat, Scotland-distilled, malted barley-based whiskey perched alongside him like a constant confidant.

            "selftext": " Hello, today I'm trying to find a partner for a DC Comics-based rp between two of my favorite characters Richard Grayson and Kori'ander. With me playing Richardand my partner playing Kori.\n\nI've loved these two since I watched the Teen Titans tv show as a kid. For this rp id like to play them as adult heroes and we can take inspiration from anything, cartoons, comics, movies, the live-action shows that I admittedly haven't seen.\n\nI'm a huge sucker for romance and love to do dates and sweet scenes as much as I enjoy plots and any action scenes.\n\nI definitely want to draw from some of the more recent comics. Richard becomes rich and tries to do some real good for the world beyond heroics. As well as including things like his newly discovered half-sister, including the Court of Owls and some of his villains. You don't have to know the comics and we don't need to exactly follow them it's just inspiration.\n\nPerhaps he is getting targeted as his civilian identity and calls Star for help perhaps she takes a bodyguard-like position or some such in his new company while working together as partners in every other regard.\n\nThe character's appearance and personality, that we base them on is entirely up for you to decide.\n\nI welcome your ideas and input for this. Use chat or I'm and we can start figuring this out!\n\nI'd prefer we do this over discord.",

But I do understand that sometimes the reply doesn\u2019t have to be long. As long as it\u2019s not just one liners all the time. I usually play in 1st person. Hope you don\u2019t mind. \n\nI enjoy getting to know my partner as well. So we can add to the tension and chemistry in the roleplay. If you can connect off of it then you can connect during it. \n\nI am in the uk, so the time difference will be there. But I post everyday and I usually stay up late as well. So you\u2019ll always hear from me. If I can\u2019t roleplay or won\u2019t be on I will give you notice in advance of that happening.\n\nIf you want to discuss anything or ask me anything I\u2019ll happily go into more detail in private chat. I look forward to creating and building a world with you.\n\nI have an idea I have been looking to try or expand on :)\n\nAlso if your not interested or happy how the roleplay is going. Just say and happy discuss how to make it better for us both.\n\nHope to chat soon :)",

It\u2019s a pretty complex one, and actually I\u2019ve the world set up, not the idea. I am pretty happy with the world I\u2019ve got though. It\u2019s reasonably in-depth &amp; provides sufficient context, backstory, &amp; information for the world (with more specific information available on request).\n\nEssentially, the idea is the classic fantasy world: mountains, deserts, rivers, ravines, princesses, weapons, magic, &amp; religions. You\u2019re free to make your own character for it - we can and hopefully will discuss that, of course - and *will* be given freedom within the confines of the world to write your character(s) how you want and, just as importantly, where you want.\n\nMake sure to message me if you okay D&amp;D because you all seem to be the very, very best at this sort of thing. Sone people take this super literally as a requirement or something but like, if you\u2019re interested\u2026 message me?\n\nPlease, please, please, be a detailed &amp; passionate writer &amp; world builder!\n\nDiscord is much preferred - thank you!",

            "selftext": "Hi there! Name's Crispy. Lately, I've been trying to organize my thoughts well enough to turn them into a real story. I have an idea floating around in my head, but I always like to role-play this sort of thing to help bring it all together!\n\nA little about me: I've been role-playing for nearly thirteen years now (started at 15.) I've always loved the creativity required to combine two minds and generate a compelling story. Plus it's a great way to make new friends. I have a tendency to be very verbose in my posts. But don't let that intimidate you! I don't expect you to write a novel just to respond.\n\nSo here's the general synopsis: your character lives on a small planet seemingly cut off from the rest of the galaxy. Most of what they're told of humans on other worlds and of space travel has come out of books and stories of those who have been to the docks to trade with the large, black ships from the rest of the galaxy. It is a quaint existence. Mostly their days are filled by work and by chores in their little coastal town. That is until the dreams start again. A figure, claiming to be your father, tells you that he has put the fate of all of humanity in your hands. A cosmological cataclysm occurs. Daily, traders and even warships can be seen in the skies. They tell horrific stories of fell beasts spewed into our reality, determined to destroy humanity. A small war fleet descends on your planet and digs in, where they will make a courageous final stand. And what follows them is worse than anything you could imagine.\n\nIf that sounds interesting let me know! Sorry I'm so bad at summaries. \u270c\ufe0f",

            "selftext": "\nHello there redditors! As the title suggests, I have been well immersed in the world of D&amp;D for a few years now, and would like to worldbuild with someone of similar interests. I would prefer a more collaborative effort, with both of us chiming in and offering ideas to further the lore of the town, country, continent, or planet that our story will take place in.\n\nAs of right now, I do not have a specific plot in mind, but I would prefer some kind of adventure based plot with some romance involved. Such romance would not necessarily be a driving factor of the plot, but I do think it would make for some intriguing character development along the way. If you are interested, I have a few brief character concepts prepared that I have not used yet. I would be more than happy to flesh them out and cater them to your ideas as needed. I am also willing to come up with an entirely new concept to go along with yours, as I enjoy the character creation process almost as much as I enjoy playing D&amp;D. \n\n\n In terms of what I\u2019m looking for, I would appreciate a strong writer who can describe scenarios with great detail and provide meaning and color to their character. My preferred platform for RP is Discord, as it allows for easy organization between channels for lore descriptions as well as the ability to keep track of posts. I\u2019d prefer responses of 2 to 3 paragraphs in length, though sometimes I\u2019ll reach the Discord character limit if I\u2019m feeling productive that day. Please understand that I have commitments during the week, so my responses may be a bit slow at times. I usually am able to post every day or two, but if there is conflict I will let you know beforehand. Please PM me if you are interested. I would love to discuss characters and plot with you! I hope this post found you well, and if not, I wish you the best in finding a RP partner that suits your expectations!",

I'm well over 18, and have been roleplaying for ages now. like everyone else, I'm here looking for a roleplay or two. more specifically, i'm looking for a Bridgerton (or Bridgerton inspired) roleplay! I've read some of the books, and I've just finished watching the show on netflix! It's a great show, highly recommend it if you need something to watch, lol. Anyway:\n\n**What I'm about:**  \n\\- 3rd person, past tense, multiple paragraphs.  \n\\- Can go from posting multiple times a day to a few times a week. We all have lives outside of the internet, I get it. Just let me know what's going on.  \n\\- I usually do canon x oc, but I'm more than happy to do oc x oc. Doubling too, of course.  \n\\- If you have limits, cool. Just let me know what they are.  \n\\- please be over 18.  \n\\- If I'm not enjoying the roleplay anymore I'll let you know, but I'm also ghost friendly so don't worry about it.\n\n**What I'm looking for:**  \n\\- I'm looking for someone to play Simon or Anthony for me, and I can play anyone for you! Alternatively, I'd be interested in creating our own ocs and using the show as inspiration.\n\nif interested, let me know!",

This story will include scenes much like the movie, maybe even more detailed during our story. I'd like it to take a drastic turn from the movies plot however.\n\nHere, I'd like to explore the concept where he isn't married, leaving him open to become interested in my character, Maeve. The major difference in this story being that Maeve genuinely falls for him and truly loves what is happening between them. This will be an absolutely dark up romance. \n\nWe can work out the details of the plot in further discussions if you're interested in this story concept.\n\nHope to hear from you soon!",

            "selftext": "Hello! I'm in search a a partner who loves fantasy based roleplay scenarios as much as I do. Now, I have had multiple takers in the passed few days, but none are able to either commit, or are strictly one liners lol. To each their own I suppose. Any-who, I consider myself literate and very detailed in my responses, and would expect my fellow partner to do so as well. I'm not a big fan of anime, so please don't say you want to be a nine tailed fox samurai lmao, doesn't fit. Otherwise, I'm very open to finding a middle ground and would love to hear your ideas, and maybe even something you've wanted to try that proteins to the fantasy course I've been wanting to take. New ideas are always fun, and building the surrounding world is always very fun as well, because it's strictly our world and our rules, no one else's\ud83d\ude04\n\nSo I have a few scenarios.\n\n1. A princess runs away from her cruel stepmother and realizes that the great sorceress is actually her mother\n\n2. A peasant/queen/king/prince finds a demon locked away, and for good reason. \n\n3. Is a little more complicated, but willing to tell you more about this third option if I hear from you!\n\n So, if fantasy is something your interested in, don't be afraid to send me a chat or a PM. Also, let me know what your favorite flavor of sucker is, just so I know you've at least read this far. Look forward to hearing from you, and have a wonderful day!!",

            "selftext": "Hey! \n\nI have posted a lot on this subreddit and have been trying around with this plot idea ever since I binged on Euphoria lol.  So bear with me as I share a quick snippet of what I have in mind for this plot and do reach out in case you are interested. \n\nMy character (Belle) is new to East Highland and is new to town. She had moved to the suburbs after she had lost her parents in a tragic car accident and had moved in with her grandmother to start over all again and to move on from her past. Belle was shy, yes and was naive too but all in all was excited to meet people her age and start school after her long summer break.\n\nNate Jacobs was popular, good looking, always at the top of his game and could practically get whatever he want. His toxic on and off relationship with Maddy was known to everyone in school. He was narcissistic, manipulative and was also violent at time when he was mad or angry or when things did not go his way.\n\nBelle knew who he was. Belle knew how dangerous Nate Jacobs was and knew how crazy Maddy was about him. She knew that even before school had started and she knew that she had stay away from him. Nate Jacobs meant trouble. But what she had not expected was to find her savior in Nate Jacobs. Well, sort of. The night before school started- she found herself in a room alone with a jock whose name she had long forgotten and who had tried everything to force himself upon her. She somehow got herself out the room with tears in her eyes and bruises on her arms and neck but knew that she was being followed. She needed to get away and needed to find a way to get out of this house. She found herself limping out, getting drenched in the rain and soon she ran into him. He was out by his car, his knuckles bruised and his head hung low. He was just as vulnerable as her. She looked up at him and whimpered out 'Help'- hoping that Nate Jacobs- of all the people- Nate Jacobs would help her out.\n________________________________________________________\n \nSo this was quick snippet of what I had in mind and was also a way of me showing my style of writing. We can take things up from here or maybe have a completely different way of starting things off. If you are interested- do reach out!! \n\nThanks \ud83c\udf52",

            "selftext": "A darkness has crept over the land, sinking its claws into all forms of life. It either corrupts, taints, or kills. It replaces what it can with godforsaken abominations which will not rest until all light has been extinguished from the land so darkness reigns supreme. \n\nThe Crown has sent countless warriors and countless scholars to fight and learn the origins of this darkness. There had to be a way to stop this curse but as time passes, the list of names at the memorial only grows and little knowledge ever returns. One day, a scholar made it back to the capital, but he was corrupted by the very essence he had been sent to destroy. This allowed him to open his mind and understand things that no other scholar had been able to before. With his last shred of humanity, he wrote all that he knew in a book.\n\nMany believe that this book is simply the writings of a madman who barely had a hold on his sanity as his humanity slipped away. But it was the only thing that the Crown had and after years of the darkness claiming more land and more resources, they needed to try something different. \n\nThe corrupted scholar wrote of vessels. Vessels that would need to make the journey to the far ends of the world, vanquish and consume the abominations to purify the regions. They needed to carry this heavy burden and resist corruption themselves. These vessels needed to return the darkness to its home and seal it up once again. \n\nThe Crown at first solicited volunteers and there were many. They went out into the world to do just as the scholar wrote in his book. None were successful but the Crown learned a few things from the reports that were sent back. Women were far more successful at resisting the corruption than men. Those traveling in smaller groups also seemed far more successful. It took only one corruption to bring down what seemed like the most capable of teams. Less people, less chances of corruption.\n\nAfter a few more tries, it was determined that pairs would be sent out into the world. A woman, a vessel, and a protector to aid her in her journey. It was turned into a ceremony this became so important for the Crown. Little by little, pairs would push back the darkness and when some failed, others would pick up where they left off. Finally, light was returning to the lands and there was hope. Against all odds, a pair made it all the way to the end. Oh, the burden she carried! So much darkness in her heart! But when time came to seal the darkness away, she decided that she liked the darkness. Instead of sealing it, she decided to command it. She turned on the Crown and like a plague she brought the darkness and all its abominations back. She corrupted other vessels and their protectors into allying with her power. \n\nDarkness, once again, threatens the world of light. And the Crown continues its search for vessels strong enough to face and persevere against the darkness and protectors to support them on their journey. But now they face corrupted vessels and their corrupted protectors. A significantly harder task than any vessel before them. But they must push on...\n\n\\--\n\nHi there! Thanks for getting this far! I\u2019m looking for someone to play a protector in this dark fantasy world, long-term journey. I would prefer a partner who is 21+. I use Discord, write in third person, past tense and I typically write anywhere from a couple paragraphs to many. Mature topics are fine with me and can be discussed when we're brainstorming. I can respond a couple times a day and like to keep open communication with my partner. I sometimes get busy; you sometimes get busy \u2013 that\u2019s fine! Though I will be GMing this journey, I would greatly appreciate collaboration, ideas, and input to help make the journey unique for both of us. If you want to go 50/50 on GMing duties, I would adore you forever but it isn't required.\n\nPlease let me know if you\u2019re interested or have any questions! Send me a pm \ud83d\ude0a",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm an experienced writer with over fifteen years' writing experience. Naturally I am 18+ and all partners and characters contained within any roleplay should also be 18+.\n\n**I am British and only looking to roleplay with other Brits. Please be literate and able to contribute something to the discussion if you contact me.**\n\nMy preference is to play via Discord, and in real time. By that I mean, the two of us sitting down at the same time to exchange moderately short (semi-para to paragraph length) posts, rather than longer posts at any time throughout the day.\n\nMy interests range from the vanilla to the embarrassingly dark, and can be discussed in private. Settings I would be interested in exploring include:\n\n\\- Political set-ups: intrigue, plotting and manipulation!\n\n\\- Sci-Fi: near future dystopias and totalitarian states!\n\n\\- Post-apoc: fairly self-explanatory!\n\n\\- Alternate history: I've a few ideas for how this could go!\n\nPlease feel free to get in touch via PM or chat, and I can provide my Discord handle. **Please be able to contribute something to the discussion if you contact me. \"Do u want to RP?\" does not count!**",

I'm a big fan of anime and currently, I'm looking to do a scene from the given animes and play the following characters - Demon Slayer(Nezuko), One Piece(Boa). My slight preference would be One Piece given the latest chapter which was in one word ; amazing!\n\nI'm seeking an openminded, detailed and creative partner who is able to put out literate responses and who has watched at least one of these animes. In each of the scenes, doesn't matter which anime, you would create an OC who would be given a task to capture one of these characters.\n\nIf you're interested, shoot me a DM!",
