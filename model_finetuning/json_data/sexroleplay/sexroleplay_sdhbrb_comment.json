I live within the Eastern Daylight Time Zone. I have been roleplaying for about a decade, so I am quite literate and typically have good grammar. Most weekdays I am quite active, weekends are hard as I have plans, so I may not be able to respond daily.\u00a0I am looking for a male partner, or a female playing as male is alright as well. This will be an Oc x Cannon character long term roleplay. \n\nI have been wanting to try polygamous relationships for a bit, so I am looking for someone who can play both characters for the ones labeled and/or would be wonderful. \n\n\ud83c\udf3aFandom/Characters\ud83c\udf3a\n\nNaruto - Obito/Tobi\n\nPokemon - Milo, Leon, Piers, Guzma\n\nHomestuck - Sollux and /or Mituna, Karkat and/or Eridan, Gamzee and/or Kurloz, or any combination of the characters listed\n\nTokyo Ghoul - Enji Koma, Uta \n\n\ud83c\udf38Requirements\ud83c\udf38\n\n3 - 6 Paragraphs per post\u00a0\n\nProper grammar\n\n{Will ask for writing sample to verify}\n\nAll Characters 18+ {And yourself, No minors}\n\nWilling to converse over plot/storyline\n\nThird person writing style\n\nNSFW details can be discussed in Dm's\u00a0\n\n\n\ud83c\udff5I require romance, angst, drama, action, comedy and most importantly, the building of emotion. I like to create as much drama and angst as possible. Tearing characters apart emotionally and to their breaking points {And beyond} is my specialty. There will be sexual scenes, but it won't be right away.\u00a0The ratio of Romance/Smut will be 40/60.\u00a0 \n\n\ud83d\udcaePrompts/Kink List\ud83d\udcae\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1iEhjsyHi-SazhCtt5vHS6cGESYQjeCL96JL_esOWuF8/edit?usp=drivesdk",
