            "selftext": " \n\nHey there! Today I\u2019ve got a massive list of rp ideas and have written out some starters along with some ideas to how I see the rp going. I\u2019m open to change and ready to do other ideas too. So if you feel like you\u2019ve got an idea I might be interested in feel free to talk to me about those: ).\n\nAs for my replies. I write in first person mainly and my reply length varies. I generally do anything from a few sentences to a paragraph or more and generally require my partner to do the same. Fair warning the less detail you reply with the less interested I\u2019ll be in rping with you. (Not looking for a few words as a response)\n\nI enjoy having a story to go along with the smut so it\u2019s not just constant sex, some cute or action driven moments are fun as well. \u2013 Hand holding and cute dates are pleasant!  \nI mainly do my rps on kik, discord or here. I also have an RP facebook account, so feel free to ask for my users for those! : )\n\nMy kinks and limits list might be a big read, but none are compulsory. I\u2019m just here to have fun and hopefully meet some cool rp partners : )\n\nKinks: Harems (Doesn\u2019t mean having to play all characters at once, just one by one is fine!), Incest, Outercourse (Which is stuff like titjobs, thigh jobs, grinding, hot dogging) Risky public spaces (Toilet stalls, changing booths. That kinda thing where people could get caught.) Facials, Freckles (Face and body). Big/nicely shaped bums (Especially if they jiggle). Creampies, Cum on tits/body, big cumshots, Thigh high socks. shower/water sex (pools, shower, hot tubs ect.) Mutual desire for sex.\n\nLimits: Pregnancy (Hard limit sorry), Vomit, Piss, Blood, Toilet stuff, Rape, Gangbangs (Unless it\u2019s multiple females) Male on Male, futas, rimming/pegging.\n\nThere might be more that I\u2019m forgetting so if you\u2019re unsure feel free to ask me! The rougher side of sex like Name calling, slapping choking spanking I can all do as well! : ) Without further ado let\u2019s jump into the starters!\n\n*Disclaimer: I am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+*\n\nHere's the basic list of ideas if you wanted to look them over before reading the full posts. I\u2019m also open to some ideas that I may have missed! And please note: I\u2019m looking for FEMALE characters only!\n\n**Rule 34/Fandom/Game Ideas:**  \n**Idea 1: My Harem (Hero) Academia.**  \n**Idea 2: Pok\u00e9mon**  \n**Idea 3: Naruto**  \n**Idea 4: Bleach**  \n**Idea 5: One piece.**  \n**Idea 6: Sword Art Online.**  \n**Idea 7: Fairy Tail.**  \n**Idea 8: Avatar The Last Airbender.**  \n**Idea 9: Persona (Girls from 4 and 5).**  \n**Idea 10: Harry Potter.**  \n**Idea 11: Final Fantasy.**  \n**Idea 12: The Witcher 3.**\n\n**OC Ideas:**  \n**Idea 13: Fantasy harem adventure.**  \n**Idea 14: Only Man of the town.**  \n**Idea 15: Zombie and Nuclear Apocalypse.**  \n**Idea 16: Sci-Fi space crew.**\n\n**Incest Ideas:**  \n**Idea 17: Brother sister/Mother son (Or both).**  \n**Idea 18: Aunt/Cousin. (Can be both)**  \n**Idea 19: Incest family vacation.**\n\n**Idea 1: My Harem (Hero) Academia.**\n\n*(So my character will be a transfer into Class 1-A. His power is the power of persuasion. With the power he\u2019s able to convince someone to do something as if it\u2019s their own will. However, he\u2019s hesitant to use it on other people and to tell everyone he even has it as he\u2019s been outcast at his last school for the villainous nature of his quirk. As such he can\u2019t use it to its full extent and can only issue small commands to begin with.*\n\n*My idea with this is that one or more (cannon or non) of the girls decide to help him out in a private setting and overtime it gets more and more sexual in nature. And as he becomes more confident, he\u2019s able to issue more longer-term commands. This can also be mixed in well with some story and some action to keep the plot interesting.)*\n\n**Starter:** It was a day which started like most others in Class 1-A. The students got ready in the dorms and headed to class to chat among themselves while they waited for Aizawa to enter. However, unlike most days there seemed to be an extra desk placed in the room. The seat caused some confusion which didn\u2019t last long as the first bell rang and Aizawa entered the room.\n\n\u201cMorning everyone.\u201d He stated in his mainly bored and sleepy tone which seemed to sound like he was stifling a yawn. \u201cToday we\u2019ve got a new student transferring in from another school. He\u2019s from Shiketsu, some of you may recognize the name since it\u2019s got the same level as prestige as U.A. but regardless make sure he feels welcome.\u201d He said pointing a sweeping stare at everyone and finally resting on the problem child of the U.A class Bakugo.\n\nWith that he fell silent and I felt it was my cue to enter. Swallowing a little at the nerves I steeled them quickly and entered. My blue eyes sweeping over some of the familiar faces in the room. Many of the students had standout performances in the UA sports festival and as well in the news reports about the villain attack on the training camp.\n\nI had a lot to live up to if I wanted to join these legends in training but regardless, I was determined to do just that. Breathing a little and shifting my auburn hair from my eyes I smiled the best I could. \u201cMy name is Schwarzer, Chris Schwarzer. It\u2019s a pleasure to meet you all.\u201d I say bowing to the class.\n\nSatisfied with the introduction Aizawa nodded to the spare seat in the room. Taking that as an order I nodded back and headed over to my seat sitting down and getting my books out. Curiously I turned to the seat next to me noticing one of the girls in the class and gave her a slight smile as Aizawa began his lesson.\n\n**Idea 2: Pokemon.**  \n(*So this one is super simple. Some trainers or a trainer and his Pok\u00e9mon go on a grand adventure. For this one my favourite Canon female are: Marnie, May, Hilda and May. And my favourite Anthro Pok\u00e9mon are Lopunny, Arcanine, Blaiziken That\u2019s just for reference though and you can really play whoever you like! Ocs are of course welcome too!)*\n\n**Trainer x Trainer Starter**:\n\nI like many others in the world of Pok\u00e9mon have just started on my journey. Although I had done so a little late. Regardless me and my starter Pok\u00e9mon Aipom which was a gift from my late father. Setting off with excitement to make a name of myself.\n\nThat excitement wore off pretty quickly however as an advanced trainer stepped in my path and soon, I realized how big the gap between us was. He wiped the floor with my aipom and laughed as he took my \u201cPrize money\u201d Scooping up my aipom I rushed through the rest of the route and over to the next town ducking quickly into the Pok\u00e9mon centre.\n\nLooking around there was a few new trainers who seemed to have fallen to the same fate as I had and I shook my head. Guys like that were total assholes and without hesitating I headed over to the counter where the nurse took my Aipom from me. Once he was gone, I was told there was going to be a short wait due to the amount of Pok\u00e9mon they had to treat. I nodded as I headed over and sat down in one of the seats.\n\n**Idea 3: Naruto.**  \n(*So for this one I like the idea that my character is a nomadic mercenary hired by the leaf to help train the ninja of the village, maybe he also has some kind of hidden power that boosts his chakra but also increases his libido. Not too sure how I wanna go about this one.*)\n\n**Starter:** The Hokage Tsunade Senju looked over me with a curious gaze and then down to my application form. \u201cYou\u2019re younger than I expected given everything you\u2019ve done.\u201d She stated honestly. \u201cBut the intelligence division did a thorough search into you and you check out.\u201d She stated as she slammed the approved stamp down onto my paper.\n\n\u201cJust remember, if you do anything to endanger this village, I\u2019ll snuff you out personally.\u201d She said in an icy and threatening tone.  \nFeeling a cold bead of sweat roll down the side of my face I nodded. \u201cOf course. I wouldn\u2019t dream of it.\u201d I say. Internally I make a mental note not to cross her in any way.\n\n\u201cGood.\u201d She said putting a smile across her features. \u201cYour first group is down on the training field waiting for you already.\u201d She stated. \u201cYour lodgings will be set up by the time you\u2019re done, here\u2019s the key.\u201d She said tossing the key to me which I caught and stuffed into my pocket.  \nI was a little shocked with how quick she wanted me to get to work but I nodded. \u201cRight!\u201d I say giving a respectful bow before heading out.\n\nIt took me a little longer than expected to actually find the training grounds as I hadn\u2019t ever been here before. And when I got there much to her credit there were a few ninja standing around. Approaching them I gave them a sheepish smile. \u201cSorry I\u2019m late guys.\u201d I called out. \u201cI got lost.\u201d I added on.\n\n**Idea 4: Bleach.**  \n(*So a new human soul reaper makes it into the soul society. His power isn\u2019t captain level to begin with simply being enough to take out the average hollow. And with the resurgence of the hollow threat the Soul Society has offered to give him a substitute badge to take out those hollows deemed too small for the soul society to handle. Maybe he\u2019s paired up with someone or someone like Orihime steps in to help him grow.*)\n\n**Starter:** Another boring day at school followed by a night of boring patrols. With all the big hollows being taken care of by \u201cFull-fledged\u201d Soul reapers it didn\u2019t leave me with much opportunity to train against bigger enemies.\n\nAt least that\u2019s what I thought originally. A few blocks from me there was a rift which opened up and the pure spiritual pressure that came from the hollow that stepped out of it was enough to make me feel as though gravity itself was pushing against me.\n\nIt was hard to breathe and even harder to stand as my hand clutched my blade in my left hand tightly. I shook my head as I heard the loud roar of the large breast and could even see it\u2019s towering form from my position.\n\nIt was nothing close to a menos, but it was enough to tower over a three-story building for sure. \u201cShit.\u201d I hissed to myself as I knew there were no soul reapers around at this stage. With a threat this big I was sure they\u2019d come, but until then it was up to me to buy some time and make sure no humans or souls were consumed.\n\nPushing myself forward I reached the park that the Hollow had appeared in. Thankfully the park was deserted at this time of night.  \nWhen he saw me the hollow. \u201cYou don\u2019t smell like much, but you\u2019ll do as a snack.\u201d The hollow commented as it charged forward.  \n\u201cJust evade, buy time.\u201d I comment to myself as I began to leap around the battle field looking a bit like and feeling like an idiot.\n\nThe hollow toyed with me a little while enjoying the chase before it seemed to ger bored. Just when I was thinking I was fast enough to keep avoiding it the creature\u2019s mouth opened and its forked tongue shot out at me with faster speed than I was anticipating I raised my blade to defend myself but it was a feeble attempt and I knew it wouldn\u2019t be enough.\n\n**Idea 5: One Piece.**  \n(*So I\u2019m not quite sure how to approach this one, but I\u2019ll give it a go. Much like the MHA starter my character will have the power of persuasion, having eaten the Persua-Persua fruit. I\u2019m thinking either he joins the Strawhats and goes on their adventures or he makes his own crew with girls from the story, I\u2019m gonna leave it fairly open ended so we can jump in whenever along the story we wanna go!)*\n\n**Starter:** Alone in a bar I sat staring in the amber liquid in my mug. I was down on my luck after having my whole crew and my ship destroyed in a long battle another pirate crew. The only reason I was able to live through the ordeal was due to my crew sacrificing themselves to give me a chance to escape.\n\nI spent days adrift with little food and water and soon washed up upon the island I was in. Immediately I found a tavern ready to drown my sorrows and feel sorry for myself for a little while.\n\nLetting out a sigh I downed the rest of my drink soon looking at the few drops of liquid bottom of my mug. I knew being a pirate wouldn\u2019t be easy, I knew it\u2019d be violent and end in violence. However, to lose in that fashion without even being able to use my devil fruit to calm or question our opponent and losing everything still took its toll on me.\n\nScratching at the growing stubble with one hand, the other I raised my mug to demand another drink and as such the bartender approached to fill my mug.  \n\u201cYou\u2019re looking a little rough there, you sure you need another?\u201d The bartender asked as he took the mug from me.  \n\u201cI don\u2019t have anything else to do. I don\u2019t even know what else to do with myself.\u201d I responded grumpily. \u201cJust fill it up.\u201d I demanded.  \n\u201cRight.\u201d The bartender responded as he filled it with more of the alcoholic amber liquid and slid It in front of me.\n\n**Idea 6: Sword Art Online.**  \n(*Fairly simple it\u2019s SAO set in the original death game. I love the idea, so I\u2019ve always loved rping this one. If you want to play canon characters my fave is for sure Lizbeth, but I\u2019m open to OC characters!)*\n\n**Starter**: It\u2019s been months since Akihiko Kayaba has trapped us into this death game. Or at least that\u2019s how some people looked at it. Others saw it as their dream come true. But most if not, all wanted to push forward and beat the game.\n\nDespite the desire to push forward little progress has been made. Guilds and parties have formed to push through dungeons but with the increased danger and with it more deaths; more and more people simply decided to live out their lives on the lower floors.\n\nUnlike those rushing in to push through the content I was happy enough to go through it at my own pace. This place was like a dream for me, save for the fact I had an increased chance of dying I was able to live in this game without the worries of the outside world.\n\nI was doing some late-night grinding in an area of dense forest. The sun had set and there was little light save for the bright moon poking through the trees. All was calm, the trees swayed with the wind and the occasional sound of creatures moving about was enough to calm me.\n\nHowever, the deeper I got into the forest the louder a sound became. At first it was quiet but as I approached, I heard it more clearly. It sounded like steel clashing against steel. Someone was fighting. Moving from a casual walk into a jog I quickly came to a small clearing where I saw two figures fighting, although in the low light I couldn\u2019t make it out until I got closer.\n\n**Idea 7: Fairy Tail.**  \n(*it\u2019s been a little while since I\u2019ve seen the series, but I\u2019ve always loved it! Given my time away I might have to take some time to refamiliarize myself with the magics. My character will simply be an entry level member into the guild to begin with, canon characters are welcome just as OCs are!*)\n\n**Starter**: Another day in magnolia and another party being held at the large guild building at the centre of town. A large-scale job had just finished with some of the senior ranking wizards. and even though I wasn\u2019t part of that mission, instead being on my own D-Rank job I joined in on the celebrations.\n\nI had only been part of the guild for a few days and so far, it\u2019s not been as exciting as I\u2019d hoped, although I figured that it\u2019d pick up once I proved myself. I was drinking by myself when I was approached by Makarov. He was wearing an essentric looking orange outfit. \u201cSchwarzer my boy!\u201d He said as he patted me on the shoulder. \u201cHow are you fitting in?\u201d He questioned.  \n\u201cFine sir! Everyone has been very welcoming.\u201d I say to him in response.  \n\u201cGlad to hear it! You\u2019ve been doing a good job, although I\u2019d like to see you do more.\u201d The male said. \u201cSo I\u2019ve arranged a partner for you on your next job, that way you can take something more challenging, what do you say?\u201d He questioned.\n\n\u201cYes of course!\u201d I say eagerly as a smile spread across my face.  \n\u201cGreat!\u201d He said cheerfully. \u201cI\u2019ll introduce you to who you\u2019ll be working with.\u201d He said as he stood from his spot and lead the way over to a female clearing his throat loud enough to get their attention.\n\n**Idea 8: Avatar the Last Airbender.**  \n(*So for this one I guess it can go two different ways. My fave girls from Avatar would probably be Ty Lee, Suki and Toph. Maybe my character is a powerful bender that either the fire nation or team Avatar wants on their side. I think it might be cool to think that Aang isn\u2019t the only airbender and instead a small faction managed to escape and continue the lineage. Either that or my character is a powerful firebender of some kind. I\u2019ll leave whichever you prefer to you in your first reply as I\u2019ll leave it open ended.)*\n\n**Starter:** The world was at war ever since the Fire nation attacked. With the intense fighting came mercenaries. Freelance benders or soldiers ready to fight on either side. For a fee of course. And despite my age, being only eighteen I was quite renown amongst the other bounty hunters for my bending.\n\nOf course, there were talks of the Avatar returning, having repelled an invasion in the south pole, the liberation of Omashu and then the fire nation prison. It seemed they were making quite the stir in the earth kingdom.\n\nIt\u2019d only be a matter of time before they reached the small town, I was in. Perhaps they were already here. But if that was the case surely there would be some kind of stir. Pushing my hair from my face I ordered another drink from the barkeep.  \n\u201cYou know you\u2019re my favourite customer Schwarzer\u2026. You\u2019re the only one who consistently pays his tab. Unlike the rest of these soldiers or the workers around here.\u201d The older man says in clear annoyance.\n\n\u201cWell who knows, if I wasn\u2019t so successful, I\u2019d probably mooch off you too.\u201d I admitted with a grin. \u201cTry not to talk too ill of the soldiers on either side.\u201d I added on flicking him an extra coin for a tip once my drink was finished. \u201cWell I better check if anyone has a job for me.\u201d I say as I pushed myself up from my seat.\n\n**Idea 9: Persona.**  \n(*So basically this is just gonna be a fairly interesting idea. My character along with the girls of persona 4 and 5 get stranded in this strange dimension where they have to fight their way out to make it back to their own worlds.*)\n\n**Starter:** It all happened so fast. One minute I was in a team meeting with my group discussing what we should use our newfound powers for next. And the next second, I had blinked and I was in some kind of strange room.\n\nOne by one more people were added into this room. Some of which were dressed in some elaborate costumes. And I frowned as I looked to each one of them, all of which I didn\u2019t recognize at all and judging by their looks they didn\u2019t recognize me. Although before we managed to introduce ourselves a booming voice broke the silence.\n\n\u201cWelcome all!\u201d The clearly male voice commented. \u201cTo the room of my design.\u201d He added on. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re all confused. And no doubt you\u2019ll want to return back to your homes. However, to do so you\u2019ll need to enter my labyrinth. \u201cMake it to the end and you\u2019ll all return home.\u201d The voice explained.\n\n\u201cOf course, this maze isn\u2019t without its dangers. Enemies, much like you encounter on a regular basis will roam these halls. As well as beasts of my own design far stronger than those\u2026 Fear no though for every check point you reach this room will become more furnished with amenities. For now, you simply have beds to rest on.\u201d He said as there was an audible click and the dark room was suddenly lit up. Sure, enough there were rows of beds all lined up one for each person to sleep on.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re ready to test yourselves step through this door and enter the first level of the labyrinth.\u201d He declared as a large door appeared and opened up in front of them.  \nFor a while nobody said anything probably all too stunned to even process the information. \u201cSo, I\u2019m guessing we\u2019re all persona users given what he just said.\u201d I spoke up. \u201cI guess we should probably start with names and strengths, right?\u201d I questioned the group. \u201cI\u2019m Chris Schwarzer.\u201d I say. \u201cMy persona Serapth focuses on ranged combat.\u201d I explained.\n\n**Idea 10: Harry Potter.**  \n(*So to keep this one interesting I\u2019m thinking of having it set in an AU where Voldemort and Harry don\u2019t exist. However, there are still dark wizards who are part of a cult around. Defs looking for a Hermionie, Luna or Ginny, you could even have other celebs/ecelebs as teachers or students for this one! Ocs are of course welcome too!)*\n\n**Starter:** Another year at Hogwarts, the last for some; and another year of learning was right around the corner. Although times were not peaceful in the wizarding world. Aurors who were the police of the magical world were going missing or showing up dead.\n\nThe ministry not wanting to make a panic kept it fairly under wraps, however some of the families have come forward with the information and rumours abounded about what was really happening.  \nStepping off the train I sighed a little rubbing my temple where a headache had begun to set in. During the train ride here, I found myself stuck next to a boy who wouldn\u2019t stop going on about the rumours and conspiracy theories.\n\nGlad to be off the train I looked around for a minute lost as to where I needed to go. \u201cI know it\u2019s around here somewhere.\u201d I commented, although my sense of direction was always off. Usually I followed everyone else. But this time it seemed I was one of the last ones off the train.\n\n**Idea 11: Final Fantasy.**  \n(*So this is simply going to be an idea with no starter since it will probably change depending on the many FF universes. My favourite however is defs FF7. (Tifa, Jessie and Aerith are best girls) with follow-ups being 12, 13, 15, 10, 8 and 9. Basically a fight would take the Main character of those series, Cloud, Noct, ect out of commission and needing a leader the other characters step up and hire mine on. Similar to some of my other prompts but I never said I was creative :\\^) With that being said though if you ARE interested in this one let me know and we can work out details depending on what world we\u2019re in!*)\n\n**Idea 12: The Witcher 3.**  \n(*So my character will be a Witcher. (wow!) Saving people, hunting things you know? The family business. Anyway, I\u2019m gonna leave it super open ended for you to come in however you like! If you wanna play a canon character my top two are for sure Ciri and Trist, and OC characters are accepted too!*)\n\n**Starter:** A Werewolf, an odd and rare contract, although I figured it wouldn\u2019t be a hard one. In face I figured with my silver blade that the creature would go down rather quickly. Starting the encounter, I was faced with a harsh reality due to my hubris. I started off well enough, however due to my carelessness I was quickly on the backfoot.\n\nThe beast roared as it swung its large clawed hand towards me. I had barely managed to roll out of the way of the attack. Probably due to the increasing levels of bloodless resulting in a careless action on my part. A level of confidence quickly pushed down by the fact a handful of open wounds stung at my flanks.\n\nMore scars for later given that I make it out of here, although with my silver blade thrown on the other side of the area leaving me with only a steel sword which barely even phases the thing. I had to reach my blade, although with my focus on dodging the attacks it was hard to find an opening to do so.\n\nI raised a hand and cast the igni sign launching flames at the creature who leapt back and I tried my best to make it past the creature only to have to dodge another strike as the beast recovered remarkably fast. \u201cStubborn bastard, aren\u2019t you?\u201d I questioned a little sourly.\n\n**Idea 13: Fantasy harem adventure.**  \n*(This one is fairly basic in nature. Basically, a young man with little combat experience leaves his poor hunting village once he\u2019s of age and sets off to join the adventurer\u2019s guild to make a name for himself and also to send money back home. He\u2019s fairly modest, naive and kind hearted. Which makes him likable and easy to take advantage of.*\n\n*We could add a story with war elements, racism and darker themes to show him that the world he idolizes isn\u2019t as cracked up as he thought it\u2019d be. Ideally, I\u2019d like a full harem party for this one but I\u2019m cool with one on one too.)*\n\n**Starter:** It had been a few days since I was finally able to leave the small village, I was raised in behind me. Sword on hip and keen to become an adventurer. Of course, I also wanted to make a name for myself and I was even more excited to see everything the world had to offer. With driving me forward I headed from my village over to the closest city which had a guild branch. A city called Ruan. It was nearly five times the size of my village if not more and yet it was nothing close to the capital city of Grancel.\n\nSmooth dirt paths soon gave way to cobblestone and my boots clacked rhythmically against the pavement as my steps soon got faster and faster as Ruan came into view. My stomach was in knots as I gripped the straps on my bag tightly and after steeling my nerves and taking in the sight of the large city, I headed through the large stone arch to the busy streets beyond.\n\nMy excited eyes looked around at every nook and cranny as I took in every detail that was on offer. Soon coming across the large marble and wood building of the adventurer\u2019s guild in front of me. I stood in front of the large building clearly awestruck and for a moment I felt completely overwhelmed. This was it. This was the first step I was going to take on my journey and yet I felt far too nervous to head inside. Instead I stood there shaking slightly as I tried to work up the courage to push those large oak doors aside and declare my presence to the world.\n\n**Idea 14: Man of the town.**  \n*(So again the premise is also pretty basic. My character wakes up in a town where there\u2019s no men, as if they all vanished at once. Including his father which leaves him home alone with his sister and mother. (It\u2019s up to you if you want incest in the plot or not.)* *We can have a story with an element of mystery to it too if you want! Or we can just bounce around the town having him bonk as many different people as you want.)*\n\n**Starter:** It\u2019s been a few weeks since all the men in the town vanished one day. One day they were there and the next they were gone. There was of course a panic even though it is much calmer than originally, it continues to creep in the back of everyone\u2019s mind. It doesn\u2019t help the fact that no outsiders have come into the town and some strange thick fog seems to stop everyone from leaving.\n\nHowever, with no answers it was left to the women of the town to pick up the slack and try to push for some level of normalcy. Except for me it seemed. Since the whole act started, I was in lockdown not being free to leave my home since my mother and sister was much too paranoid that I\u2019d disappear too. With the amount of time I spent indoors going stir crazy I began to wonder if it was better to be wherever the rest of them are.\n\nToday was different though and finally I was given the chance to leave the house while my mother was careless and rather quickly, I headed out into the street just glad to take in the scenery as I headed over to a nearby park. I headed over the soft grass feeling it beneath my shoes and then to the pond where I took a seat on one of the mounted benches.\n\n**Idea 15: Zombie and Nuclear Apocalypse.**  \n*(Not a whole lot to say here other than it\u2019s one of your run of the mill Zombie/Nuclear apocalypse scenarios. I might toy with the idea of having multiple zombie types like games such as Dying light and Left for dead in order to spice things up a little but we\u2019ll see where we go with it. As for nuclear I\u2019ll probably be following along the Fallout franchise. Being part of these worlds will probably make my character a bit more brash, blunt and even a little rude. However, given some time he\u2019ll warm up.)*\n\n**Zombie Starter:**  \nNo one knows quite when the outbreak started, however it swept over the globe causing panic. People eating people. People dying and coming back to life as a shambling corpse joining the armies of similar creatures. Society crumbled over time and the cities which were now hot zones for hordes of the undead creatures were left abandoned to all but the most daring or desperate of individuals. However, these rabid hordes weren\u2019t the only thing to look out for in the apocalypse.\n\nSociety had begun to reform in its most primal form. People grouped together for safety. Those who just wanted to live peacefully became easy prey for those who saw the end of the world as we knew it as a playground to kill pillage and steal what they\u2019d like. These bandits created their own factions with their own fortresses and seemed to have an endless supply of guns and ammo as they used it quite liberally.\n\nI had been on the trail of a particularly nasty group of bandits as they razed whatever small settlements, they had to the ground callously and without mercy. I had just arrived at one of these towns. Dying people lay scattered about while fires licked at the makeshift buildings. It was still quite fresh. Approaching a nearby body which seemed to be moving slightly I turned it over the man was in bad shape and was clearly on death\u2019s door. His eyes looking into mine in a pleading sense.\n\n\u201cDo you want me to make it quick?\u201d I asked him reaching my left hand down to my machete which hung on my belt. Weakly his hand reached out to grip my right as he gave a nod. I knew the death wouldn\u2019t be clean, as I unsheathed my blade. However, I couldn\u2019t waste any ammo on my pistol nor could I risk tipping off the bandits that did this that I was following them. With a quick swing I slammed the blade into the head of the man ending his life and after wiping the blade off on his shirt I slid it back into its sheath my eyes scanning the immediate area for any of the undead which had turned or for a slim chance of getting a glimpse of survivors.\n\n**Nuclear Apocalypse Starter:**\n\nThe world as we knew it ended in a flash. A white light followed by a rumble which washed over the world in nuclear fire. Billions died then and there reducing the world\u2019s population to the brink. Those who were lucky to survive a direct blast were mutated to become much different than humans and more akin to zombies. Those outside of it didn\u2019t have much quality of life as the radiation created mutated creatures which made living in a barren wasteland that much harder.\n\nThere were others however who were lucky enough to be given a spot in giant underground vaults. There they lived out their lives separated from the horrors that this new world wrought. One by one these vaults opened to allow these vault dwellers into the wasteland that was our world.\n\nTheir blue suits and clueless natures made them stand out and become easy prey to raiders, giant creatures and everything in between. Many of them didn\u2019t get far before being gutted and robbed for their illusive vault suits which earned enough to feed a scavenger or bandit for a month.\n\nThe world and society began to rebuild. And with small settlements and towns popping up here and there it wasn\u2019t all doom and gloom for the wasteland. Many were able to create jobs in local milita, mercenary work. Even trading or bartending.\n\nI was such a mercenary a few generations of my family lived through the bombing and the radiation which was lucky enough for me, I guess. I was hired to do whatever someone wanted for the right price. And today I was tasked with delving into a recently opened vault and check make contact with the inhabitants inside.\n\nColt python on my waist I headed over to the large vault door which at this point was sealed shut and knocked loudly. This job seemed rather easy and was paying a lot which made me wonder who I was working for and what purpose they had with these vault dwellers. However, I wasn\u2019t paid to ask questions nor did I really care at the end of the day. The less I knew the less guilt I could feel.\n\n**Idea 16: Space/Scifi.**  \n*(So this is a scifi adventure. My character is the captain of his own ship and is currently looking for recruits to join him and help run it. There will probably be lots of interesting planets our characters go to and I\u2019ll certainly be making them up as we go along! Your character can range as anything from a human to android or even an alien.)*\n\n**Starter:** Stepping out of The Tempest I breathed in the humid station air of Astra station. The station which was on the furthest reaches of the space ruled over the galactic council; was a haven for the depraved. Outlaws, mercenaries, drug dealers you name it Astra has it and in bountiful supply too.\n\nWhich made it a perfect spot to find someone who was desperate to get off the station. Someone who would work for cheap or for free. All I needed to do was to find them.  \n\u201cSchwarzer, don\u2019t forget to stock up on food, military rations are sad.\u201d A voice commented through the earpiece I had.  \n\u201cYeah. I\u2019ll head through the slums and to the market. Thanks, Evai.\u201d I responded.  \n\u201cAnd don\u2019t cause any trouble, I don\u2019t wanna rot in this ship while you\u2019re dead.\u201d The voice added on.  \n\u201cYeah yeah I\u2019ve got it.\u201d I responded as the communication line was severed and I started on my walk.\n\nI headed through a nearby door and down into the depths of the station. Soon I the overcrowded and frankly smelly slums. Beggars and gang members lined every corner all looking at me with a cautious eye as I passed. There were even a few tweaked out drug users laying scattered about in some dark corners. Even a few corpses.\n\nI didn\u2019t stop though, if you stayed in one place too long down here you were asking to be jumped and quickly, I pushed on heading over to the bustling markets. The food quality here wasn\u2019t the best although it was abundant. I even talked to a few of the store owners to see if they knew where I could find the extra hands to help me on my ship.\n\n**Idea 17: Brother sister/Mother son (Or both).**  \n(*So, this starter is gonna be fairly generic, however it\u2019s open to allowing any of the familial ties to be easily included. I have a few ideas for immediate family and will post them below and if you have any ideas, I\u2019m happy to hear them.)*\n\n**Starter:** It\u2019s a hot and lazy day in the middle of summer break. I had laid splayed out on the couch at home. Despite the air conditioner being on full blast my skin underneath my tank top was getting stuck to the leather couch; which did little to alleviate the heat fluster that was going on. I sighed after looking over the back of the couch to the pool outback longingly. I sighed a little resigning myself to bite the bullet and peeled myself from the couch.\n\nAs much as I wanted to strip down and run out, I wasn\u2019t entirely sure if I was home alone and as such, I headed up to my room to change into a pair of swimming trunks before heading back downstairs. Passing through the laundry and grabbing a towel on the way.\n\nI headed onto the back deck and draped my towel over the railing before I rushed over and leapt into the pool immediately feeling the cool water wash away any of the heat I had been feeling. I resurface and breathed a sigh of relief as I pushed my messy hair back from my face.\n\n**Idea 18: Aunt/Cousin (Can be both).**  \n*(Again like the incest scene above I\u2019m not quite sure how to spruce this one up so I\u2019ll leave it rather basic and we can go from there.)*\n\n**Starter:** My family has gone on holiday without me as I had to stay behind due to being caught up in exams. Rather than meeting up with them later they decided it would be more fun for me if I finished them up then headed over to spend some time with my Aunt and my cousin across the county. While I wouldn\u2019t be leaving the country, I was still getting a vacation in a way and as such I tried my best to be upbeat and positive about it, even if I was envious of the others.\n\nWhile it wasn\u2019t the same pristine beaches and high-class resorts that the rest of my family was going to, I was still grateful for the hospitality. The plane lands in the airport and after collecting my bags and checking my phone for a confirmation I was going to be picked up I sent my family and my aunt and cousin a quick text telling them I landed safely. After gathering my small suitcase from the conveyor belt, I wheeled it through security and out to the meeting area keeping my eyes peeled for any sign of my cousin or my auntie. There was a little confusion about who was going to greet me so I wasn\u2019t sure who to expect myself.\n\n**Idea 19: Incest family vacation.**  \n*(So, this one is again going to be like the other two before it. They kinda roll off each other in a way.* *However, I believe it allows for a wide range of engagements with multiple characters at some kind of beach resort.)*\n\n**Starter:** It\u2019s the dead middle of another scorching summer and rather than tough it out in our homes which has air-conditioning which never seemed to help, our large family decided to all go to a large resort (Could even be a cruise too) together. Many of the rooms were rather luxurious and I was more than excited to see what the rest of the hotel had to offer.\n\nWe pulled up into the lobby and while the parents were checking in I headed over to check out a map on the wall. It seemed there were quite a lot of different things to do around the resort. There was a pool with a poolside bar, a beach which had volleyball games, a massage parlour, hot tubs and many different activities ranging from native dances to eating competitions.\n\nJust the realization we were here and the excitement at the many possibilities that could come from the vacation. Maybe I\u2019d even meet someone nice and have a vacation fling. Although with so many family members running around, I doubted that I\u2019d get much peace to do that. Regardless I was eager to get up to the room, have a shower and change into my swimming trunks to explore all the different places.\n\nWe headed up to the rooms where I noticed mine had a large double bed. However, judging by my mother\u2019s comments outside It seemed there was some kind of mix-up in the rooms and I\u2019d be sharing the room with one of my family members. Not that I minded too much. I placed my suitcase down and waited to see who would come in and if they were interested in joining me look around.\n\n**Closing words:** So yeah that\u2019s about it! Thanks for reading and if you have any questions or suggestions, I\u2019m open to hearing them! I know this was probably a big read so thanks again for your time and I hope to talk to some of you soon!",

            "selftext": " \n\nHey there! Today I\u2019ve got a massive list of rp ideas and have written out some starters along with some ideas to how I see the rp going. I\u2019m open to change and ready to do other ideas too. So if you feel like you\u2019ve got an idea I might be interested in feel free to talk to me about those: ).\n\nAs for my replies. I write in first person mainly and my reply length varies. I generally do anything from a few sentences to a paragraph or more and generally require my partner to do the same. Fair warning the less detail you reply with the less interested I\u2019ll be in rping with you. (Not looking for a few words as a response)\n\nI enjoy having a story to go along with the smut so it\u2019s not just constant sex, some cute or action driven moments are fun as well. \u2013 Hand holding and cute dates are pleasant!  \nI mainly do my rps on kik, discord or here. I also have an RP facebook account, so feel free to ask for my users for those! : )\n\nMy kinks and limits list might be a big read, but none are compulsory. I\u2019m just here to have fun and hopefully meet some cool rp partners : )\n\nKinks: Harems (Doesn\u2019t mean having to play all characters at once, just one by one is fine!), Incest, Outercourse (Which is stuff like titjobs, thigh jobs, grinding, hot dogging) Risky public spaces (Toilet stalls, changing booths. That kinda thing where people could get caught.) Facials, Freckles (Face and body). Big/nicely shaped bums (Especially if they jiggle). Creampies, Cum on tits/body, big cumshots, Thigh high socks. shower/water sex (pools, shower, hot tubs ect.) Mutual desire for sex.\n\nLimits: Pregnancy (Hard limit sorry), Vomit, Piss, Blood, Toilet stuff, Rape, Gangbangs (Unless it\u2019s multiple females) Male on Male, futas, rimming/pegging.\n\nThere might be more that I\u2019m forgetting so if you\u2019re unsure feel free to ask me! The rougher side of sex like Name calling, slapping choking spanking I can all do as well! : ) Without further ado let\u2019s jump into the starters!\n\n*Disclaimer: I am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+*\n\nHere's the basic list of ideas if you wanted to look them over before reading the full posts. I\u2019m also open to some ideas that I may have missed! And please note: I\u2019m looking for FEMALE characters only!\n\n**Rule 34/Fandom/Game Ideas:**  \n**Idea 1: My Harem (Hero) Academia.**  \n**Idea 2: Pok\u00e9mon**  \n**Idea 3: Naruto**  \n**Idea 4: Bleach**  \n**Idea 5: One piece.**  \n**Idea 6: Sword Art Online.**  \n**Idea 7: Fairy Tail.**  \n**Idea 8: Avatar The Last Airbender.**  \n**Idea 9: Persona (Girls from 4 and 5).**  \n**Idea 10: Harry Potter.**  \n**Idea 11: Final Fantasy.**  \n**Idea 12: The Witcher 3.**\n\n**OC Ideas:**  \n**Idea 13: Fantasy harem adventure.**  \n**Idea 14: Only Man of the town.**  \n**Idea 15: Zombie and Nuclear Apocalypse.**  \n**Idea 16: Sci-Fi space crew.**\n\n**Incest Ideas:**  \n**Idea 17: Brother sister/Mother son (Or both).**  \n**Idea 18: Aunt/Cousin. (Can be both)**  \n**Idea 19: Incest family vacation.**\n\n**Idea 1: My Harem (Hero) Academia.**\n\n*(So my character will be a transfer into Class 1-A. His power is the power of persuasion. With the power he\u2019s able to convince someone to do something as if it\u2019s their own will. However, he\u2019s hesitant to use it on other people and to tell everyone he even has it as he\u2019s been outcast at his last school for the villainous nature of his quirk. As such he can\u2019t use it to its full extent and can only issue small commands to begin with.*\n\n*My idea with this is that one or more (cannon or non) of the girls decide to help him out in a private setting and overtime it gets more and more sexual in nature. And as he becomes more confident, he\u2019s able to issue more longer-term commands. This can also be mixed in well with some story and some action to keep the plot interesting.)*\n\n**Starter:** It was a day which started like most others in Class 1-A. The students got ready in the dorms and headed to class to chat among themselves while they waited for Aizawa to enter. However, unlike most days there seemed to be an extra desk placed in the room. The seat caused some confusion which didn\u2019t last long as the first bell rang and Aizawa entered the room.\n\n\u201cMorning everyone.\u201d He stated in his mainly bored and sleepy tone which seemed to sound like he was stifling a yawn. \u201cToday we\u2019ve got a new student transferring in from another school. He\u2019s from Shiketsu, some of you may recognize the name since it\u2019s got the same level as prestige as U.A. but regardless make sure he feels welcome.\u201d He said pointing a sweeping stare at everyone and finally resting on the problem child of the U.A class Bakugo.\n\nWith that he fell silent and I felt it was my cue to enter. Swallowing a little at the nerves I steeled them quickly and entered. My blue eyes sweeping over some of the familiar faces in the room. Many of the students had standout performances in the UA sports festival and as well in the news reports about the villain attack on the training camp.\n\nI had a lot to live up to if I wanted to join these legends in training but regardless, I was determined to do just that. Breathing a little and shifting my auburn hair from my eyes I smiled the best I could. \u201cMy name is Schwarzer, Chris Schwarzer. It\u2019s a pleasure to meet you all.\u201d I say bowing to the class.\n\nSatisfied with the introduction Aizawa nodded to the spare seat in the room. Taking that as an order I nodded back and headed over to my seat sitting down and getting my books out. Curiously I turned to the seat next to me noticing one of the girls in the class and gave her a slight smile as Aizawa began his lesson.\n\n**Idea 2: Pokemon.**  \n(*So this one is super simple. Some trainers or a trainer and his Pok\u00e9mon go on a grand adventure. For this one my favourite Canon female are: Marnie, May, Hilda and May. And my favourite Anthro Pok\u00e9mon are Lopunny, Arcanine, Blaiziken That\u2019s just for reference though and you can really play whoever you like! Ocs are of course welcome too!)*\n\n**Trainer x Trainer Starter**:\n\nI like many others in the world of Pok\u00e9mon have just started on my journey. Although I had done so a little late. Regardless me and my starter Pok\u00e9mon Aipom which was a gift from my late father. Setting off with excitement to make a name of myself.\n\nThat excitement wore off pretty quickly however as an advanced trainer stepped in my path and soon, I realized how big the gap between us was. He wiped the floor with my aipom and laughed as he took my \u201cPrize money\u201d Scooping up my aipom I rushed through the rest of the route and over to the next town ducking quickly into the Pok\u00e9mon centre.\n\nLooking around there was a few new trainers who seemed to have fallen to the same fate as I had and I shook my head. Guys like that were total assholes and without hesitating I headed over to the counter where the nurse took my Aipom from me. Once he was gone, I was told there was going to be a short wait due to the amount of Pok\u00e9mon they had to treat. I nodded as I headed over and sat down in one of the seats.\n\n**Idea 3: Naruto.**  \n(*So for this one I like the idea that my character is a nomadic mercenary hired by the leaf to help train the ninja of the village, maybe he also has some kind of hidden power that boosts his chakra but also increases his libido. Not too sure how I wanna go about this one.*)\n\n**Starter:** The Hokage Tsunade Senju looked over me with a curious gaze and then down to my application form. \u201cYou\u2019re younger than I expected given everything you\u2019ve done.\u201d She stated honestly. \u201cBut the intelligence division did a thorough search into you and you check out.\u201d She stated as she slammed the approved stamp down onto my paper.\n\n\u201cJust remember, if you do anything to endanger this village, I\u2019ll snuff you out personally.\u201d She said in an icy and threatening tone.  \nFeeling a cold bead of sweat roll down the side of my face I nodded. \u201cOf course. I wouldn\u2019t dream of it.\u201d I say. Internally I make a mental note not to cross her in any way.\n\n\u201cGood.\u201d She said putting a smile across her features. \u201cYour first group is down on the training field waiting for you already.\u201d She stated. \u201cYour lodgings will be set up by the time you\u2019re done, here\u2019s the key.\u201d She said tossing the key to me which I caught and stuffed into my pocket.  \nI was a little shocked with how quick she wanted me to get to work but I nodded. \u201cRight!\u201d I say giving a respectful bow before heading out.\n\nIt took me a little longer than expected to actually find the training grounds as I hadn\u2019t ever been here before. And when I got there much to her credit there were a few ninja standing around. Approaching them I gave them a sheepish smile. \u201cSorry I\u2019m late guys.\u201d I called out. \u201cI got lost.\u201d I added on.\n\n**Idea 4: Bleach.**  \n(*So a new human soul reaper makes it into the soul society. His power isn\u2019t captain level to begin with simply being enough to take out the average hollow. And with the resurgence of the hollow threat the Soul Society has offered to give him a substitute badge to take out those hollows deemed too small for the soul society to handle. Maybe he\u2019s paired up with someone or someone like Orihime steps in to help him grow.*)\n\n**Starter:** Another boring day at school followed by a night of boring patrols. With all the big hollows being taken care of by \u201cFull-fledged\u201d Soul reapers it didn\u2019t leave me with much opportunity to train against bigger enemies.\n\nAt least that\u2019s what I thought originally. A few blocks from me there was a rift which opened up and the pure spiritual pressure that came from the hollow that stepped out of it was enough to make me feel as though gravity itself was pushing against me.\n\nIt was hard to breathe and even harder to stand as my hand clutched my blade in my left hand tightly. I shook my head as I heard the loud roar of the large breast and could even see it\u2019s towering form from my position.\n\nIt was nothing close to a menos, but it was enough to tower over a three-story building for sure. \u201cShit.\u201d I hissed to myself as I knew there were no soul reapers around at this stage. With a threat this big I was sure they\u2019d come, but until then it was up to me to buy some time and make sure no humans or souls were consumed.\n\nPushing myself forward I reached the park that the Hollow had appeared in. Thankfully the park was deserted at this time of night.  \nWhen he saw me the hollow. \u201cYou don\u2019t smell like much, but you\u2019ll do as a snack.\u201d The hollow commented as it charged forward.  \n\u201cJust evade, buy time.\u201d I comment to myself as I began to leap around the battle field looking a bit like and feeling like an idiot.\n\nThe hollow toyed with me a little while enjoying the chase before it seemed to ger bored. Just when I was thinking I was fast enough to keep avoiding it the creature\u2019s mouth opened and its forked tongue shot out at me with faster speed than I was anticipating I raised my blade to defend myself but it was a feeble attempt and I knew it wouldn\u2019t be enough.\n\n**Idea 5: One Piece.**  \n(*So I\u2019m not quite sure how to approach this one, but I\u2019ll give it a go. Much like the MHA starter my character will have the power of persuasion, having eaten the Persua-Persua fruit. I\u2019m thinking either he joins the Strawhats and goes on their adventures or he makes his own crew with girls from the story, I\u2019m gonna leave it fairly open ended so we can jump in whenever along the story we wanna go!)*\n\n**Starter:** Alone in a bar I sat staring in the amber liquid in my mug. I was down on my luck after having my whole crew and my ship destroyed in a long battle another pirate crew. The only reason I was able to live through the ordeal was due to my crew sacrificing themselves to give me a chance to escape.\n\nI spent days adrift with little food and water and soon washed up upon the island I was in. Immediately I found a tavern ready to drown my sorrows and feel sorry for myself for a little while.\n\nLetting out a sigh I downed the rest of my drink soon looking at the few drops of liquid bottom of my mug. I knew being a pirate wouldn\u2019t be easy, I knew it\u2019d be violent and end in violence. However, to lose in that fashion without even being able to use my devil fruit to calm or question our opponent and losing everything still took its toll on me.\n\nScratching at the growing stubble with one hand, the other I raised my mug to demand another drink and as such the bartender approached to fill my mug.  \n\u201cYou\u2019re looking a little rough there, you sure you need another?\u201d The bartender asked as he took the mug from me.  \n\u201cI don\u2019t have anything else to do. I don\u2019t even know what else to do with myself.\u201d I responded grumpily. \u201cJust fill it up.\u201d I demanded.  \n\u201cRight.\u201d The bartender responded as he filled it with more of the alcoholic amber liquid and slid It in front of me.\n\n**Idea 6: Sword Art Online.**  \n(*Fairly simple it\u2019s SAO set in the original death game. I love the idea, so I\u2019ve always loved rping this one. If you want to play canon characters my fave is for sure Lizbeth, but I\u2019m open to OC characters!)*\n\n**Starter**: It\u2019s been months since Akihiko Kayaba has trapped us into this death game. Or at least that\u2019s how some people looked at it. Others saw it as their dream come true. But most if not, all wanted to push forward and beat the game.\n\nDespite the desire to push forward little progress has been made. Guilds and parties have formed to push through dungeons but with the increased danger and with it more deaths; more and more people simply decided to live out their lives on the lower floors.\n\nUnlike those rushing in to push through the content I was happy enough to go through it at my own pace. This place was like a dream for me, save for the fact I had an increased chance of dying I was able to live in this game without the worries of the outside world.\n\nI was doing some late-night grinding in an area of dense forest. The sun had set and there was little light save for the bright moon poking through the trees. All was calm, the trees swayed with the wind and the occasional sound of creatures moving about was enough to calm me.\n\nHowever, the deeper I got into the forest the louder a sound became. At first it was quiet but as I approached, I heard it more clearly. It sounded like steel clashing against steel. Someone was fighting. Moving from a casual walk into a jog I quickly came to a small clearing where I saw two figures fighting, although in the low light I couldn\u2019t make it out until I got closer.\n\n**Idea 7: Fairy Tail.**  \n(*it\u2019s been a little while since I\u2019ve seen the series, but I\u2019ve always loved it! Given my time away I might have to take some time to refamiliarize myself with the magics. My character will simply be an entry level member into the guild to begin with, canon characters are welcome just as OCs are!*)\n\n**Starter**: Another day in magnolia and another party being held at the large guild building at the centre of town. A large-scale job had just finished with some of the senior ranking wizards. and even though I wasn\u2019t part of that mission, instead being on my own D-Rank job I joined in on the celebrations.\n\nI had only been part of the guild for a few days and so far, it\u2019s not been as exciting as I\u2019d hoped, although I figured that it\u2019d pick up once I proved myself. I was drinking by myself when I was approached by Makarov. He was wearing an essentric looking orange outfit. \u201cSchwarzer my boy!\u201d He said as he patted me on the shoulder. \u201cHow are you fitting in?\u201d He questioned.  \n\u201cFine sir! Everyone has been very welcoming.\u201d I say to him in response.  \n\u201cGlad to hear it! You\u2019ve been doing a good job, although I\u2019d like to see you do more.\u201d The male said. \u201cSo I\u2019ve arranged a partner for you on your next job, that way you can take something more challenging, what do you say?\u201d He questioned.\n\n\u201cYes of course!\u201d I say eagerly as a smile spread across my face.  \n\u201cGreat!\u201d He said cheerfully. \u201cI\u2019ll introduce you to who you\u2019ll be working with.\u201d He said as he stood from his spot and lead the way over to a female clearing his throat loud enough to get their attention.\n\n**Idea 8: Avatar the Last Airbender.**  \n(*So for this one I guess it can go two different ways. My fave girls from Avatar would probably be Ty Lee, Suki and Toph. Maybe my character is a powerful bender that either the fire nation or team Avatar wants on their side. I think it might be cool to think that Aang isn\u2019t the only airbender and instead a small faction managed to escape and continue the lineage. Either that or my character is a powerful firebender of some kind. I\u2019ll leave whichever you prefer to you in your first reply as I\u2019ll leave it open ended.)*\n\n**Starter:** The world was at war ever since the Fire nation attacked. With the intense fighting came mercenaries. Freelance benders or soldiers ready to fight on either side. For a fee of course. And despite my age, being only eighteen I was quite renown amongst the other bounty hunters for my bending.\n\nOf course, there were talks of the Avatar returning, having repelled an invasion in the south pole, the liberation of Omashu and then the fire nation prison. It seemed they were making quite the stir in the earth kingdom.\n\nIt\u2019d only be a matter of time before they reached the small town, I was in. Perhaps they were already here. But if that was the case surely there would be some kind of stir. Pushing my hair from my face I ordered another drink from the barkeep.  \n\u201cYou know you\u2019re my favourite customer Schwarzer\u2026. You\u2019re the only one who consistently pays his tab. Unlike the rest of these soldiers or the workers around here.\u201d The older man says in clear annoyance.\n\n\u201cWell who knows, if I wasn\u2019t so successful, I\u2019d probably mooch off you too.\u201d I admitted with a grin. \u201cTry not to talk too ill of the soldiers on either side.\u201d I added on flicking him an extra coin for a tip once my drink was finished. \u201cWell I better check if anyone has a job for me.\u201d I say as I pushed myself up from my seat.\n\n**Idea 9: Persona.**  \n(*So basically this is just gonna be a fairly interesting idea. My character along with the girls of persona 4 and 5 get stranded in this strange dimension where they have to fight their way out to make it back to their own worlds.*)\n\n**Starter:** It all happened so fast. One minute I was in a team meeting with my group discussing what we should use our newfound powers for next. And the next second, I had blinked and I was in some kind of strange room.\n\nOne by one more people were added into this room. Some of which were dressed in some elaborate costumes. And I frowned as I looked to each one of them, all of which I didn\u2019t recognize at all and judging by their looks they didn\u2019t recognize me. Although before we managed to introduce ourselves a booming voice broke the silence.\n\n\u201cWelcome all!\u201d The clearly male voice commented. \u201cTo the room of my design.\u201d He added on. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re all confused. And no doubt you\u2019ll want to return back to your homes. However, to do so you\u2019ll need to enter my labyrinth. \u201cMake it to the end and you\u2019ll all return home.\u201d The voice explained.\n\n\u201cOf course, this maze isn\u2019t without its dangers. Enemies, much like you encounter on a regular basis will roam these halls. As well as beasts of my own design far stronger than those\u2026 Fear no though for every check point you reach this room will become more furnished with amenities. For now, you simply have beds to rest on.\u201d He said as there was an audible click and the dark room was suddenly lit up. Sure, enough there were rows of beds all lined up one for each person to sleep on.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re ready to test yourselves step through this door and enter the first level of the labyrinth.\u201d He declared as a large door appeared and opened up in front of them.  \nFor a while nobody said anything probably all too stunned to even process the information. \u201cSo, I\u2019m guessing we\u2019re all persona users given what he just said.\u201d I spoke up. \u201cI guess we should probably start with names and strengths, right?\u201d I questioned the group. \u201cI\u2019m Chris Schwarzer.\u201d I say. \u201cMy persona Serapth focuses on ranged combat.\u201d I explained.\n\n**Idea 10: Harry Potter.**  \n(*So to keep this one interesting I\u2019m thinking of having it set in an AU where Voldemort and Harry don\u2019t exist. However, there are still dark wizards who are part of a cult around. Defs looking for a Hermionie, Luna or Ginny, you could even have other celebs/ecelebs as teachers or students for this one! Ocs are of course welcome too!)*\n\n**Starter:** Another year at Hogwarts, the last for some; and another year of learning was right around the corner. Although times were not peaceful in the wizarding world. Aurors who were the police of the magical world were going missing or showing up dead.\n\nThe ministry not wanting to make a panic kept it fairly under wraps, however some of the families have come forward with the information and rumours abounded about what was really happening.  \nStepping off the train I sighed a little rubbing my temple where a headache had begun to set in. During the train ride here, I found myself stuck next to a boy who wouldn\u2019t stop going on about the rumours and conspiracy theories.\n\nGlad to be off the train I looked around for a minute lost as to where I needed to go. \u201cI know it\u2019s around here somewhere.\u201d I commented, although my sense of direction was always off. Usually I followed everyone else. But this time it seemed I was one of the last ones off the train.\n\n**Idea 11: Final Fantasy.**  \n(*So this is simply going to be an idea with no starter since it will probably change depending on the many FF universes. My favourite however is defs FF7. (Tifa, Jessie and Aerith are best girls) with follow-ups being 12, 13, 15, 10, 8 and 9. Basically a fight would take the Main character of those series, Cloud, Noct, ect out of commission and needing a leader the other characters step up and hire mine on. Similar to some of my other prompts but I never said I was creative :\\^) With that being said though if you ARE interested in this one let me know and we can work out details depending on what world we\u2019re in!*)\n\n**Idea 12: The Witcher 3.**  \n(*So my character will be a Witcher. (wow!) Saving people, hunting things you know? The family business. Anyway, I\u2019m gonna leave it super open ended for you to come in however you like! If you wanna play a canon character my top two are for sure Ciri and Trist, and OC characters are accepted too!*)\n\n**Starter:** A Werewolf, an odd and rare contract, although I figured it wouldn\u2019t be a hard one. In face I figured with my silver blade that the creature would go down rather quickly. Starting the encounter, I was faced with a harsh reality due to my hubris. I started off well enough, however due to my carelessness I was quickly on the backfoot.\n\nThe beast roared as it swung its large clawed hand towards me. I had barely managed to roll out of the way of the attack. Probably due to the increasing levels of bloodless resulting in a careless action on my part. A level of confidence quickly pushed down by the fact a handful of open wounds stung at my flanks.\n\nMore scars for later given that I make it out of here, although with my silver blade thrown on the other side of the area leaving me with only a steel sword which barely even phases the thing. I had to reach my blade, although with my focus on dodging the attacks it was hard to find an opening to do so.\n\nI raised a hand and cast the igni sign launching flames at the creature who leapt back and I tried my best to make it past the creature only to have to dodge another strike as the beast recovered remarkably fast. \u201cStubborn bastard, aren\u2019t you?\u201d I questioned a little sourly.\n\n**Idea 13: Fantasy harem adventure.**  \n*(This one is fairly basic in nature. Basically, a young man with little combat experience leaves his poor hunting village once he\u2019s of age and sets off to join the adventurer\u2019s guild to make a name for himself and also to send money back home. He\u2019s fairly modest, naive and kind hearted. Which makes him likable and easy to take advantage of.*\n\n*We could add a story with war elements, racism and darker themes to show him that the world he idolizes isn\u2019t as cracked up as he thought it\u2019d be. Ideally, I\u2019d like a full harem party for this one but I\u2019m cool with one on one too.)*\n\n**Starter:** It had been a few days since I was finally able to leave the small village, I was raised in behind me. Sword on hip and keen to become an adventurer. Of course, I also wanted to make a name for myself and I was even more excited to see everything the world had to offer. With driving me forward I headed from my village over to the closest city which had a guild branch. A city called Ruan. It was nearly five times the size of my village if not more and yet it was nothing close to the capital city of Grancel.\n\nSmooth dirt paths soon gave way to cobblestone and my boots clacked rhythmically against the pavement as my steps soon got faster and faster as Ruan came into view. My stomach was in knots as I gripped the straps on my bag tightly and after steeling my nerves and taking in the sight of the large city, I headed through the large stone arch to the busy streets beyond.\n\nMy excited eyes looked around at every nook and cranny as I took in every detail that was on offer. Soon coming across the large marble and wood building of the adventurer\u2019s guild in front of me. I stood in front of the large building clearly awestruck and for a moment I felt completely overwhelmed. This was it. This was the first step I was going to take on my journey and yet I felt far too nervous to head inside. Instead I stood there shaking slightly as I tried to work up the courage to push those large oak doors aside and declare my presence to the world.\n\n**Idea 14: Man of the town.**  \n*(So again the premise is also pretty basic. My character wakes up in a town where there\u2019s no men, as if they all vanished at once. Including his father which leaves him home alone with his sister and mother. (It\u2019s up to you if you want incest in the plot or not.)* *We can have a story with an element of mystery to it too if you want! Or we can just bounce around the town having him bonk as many different people as you want.)*\n\n**Starter:** It\u2019s been a few weeks since all the men in the town vanished one day. One day they were there and the next they were gone. There was of course a panic even though it is much calmer than originally, it continues to creep in the back of everyone\u2019s mind. It doesn\u2019t help the fact that no outsiders have come into the town and some strange thick fog seems to stop everyone from leaving.\n\nHowever, with no answers it was left to the women of the town to pick up the slack and try to push for some level of normalcy. Except for me it seemed. Since the whole act started, I was in lockdown not being free to leave my home since my mother and sister was much too paranoid that I\u2019d disappear too. With the amount of time I spent indoors going stir crazy I began to wonder if it was better to be wherever the rest of them are.\n\nToday was different though and finally I was given the chance to leave the house while my mother was careless and rather quickly, I headed out into the street just glad to take in the scenery as I headed over to a nearby park. I headed over the soft grass feeling it beneath my shoes and then to the pond where I took a seat on one of the mounted benches.\n\n**Idea 15: Zombie and Nuclear Apocalypse.**  \n*(Not a whole lot to say here other than it\u2019s one of your run of the mill Zombie/Nuclear apocalypse scenarios. I might toy with the idea of having multiple zombie types like games such as Dying light and Left for dead in order to spice things up a little but we\u2019ll see where we go with it. As for nuclear I\u2019ll probably be following along the Fallout franchise. Being part of these worlds will probably make my character a bit more brash, blunt and even a little rude. However, given some time he\u2019ll warm up.)*\n\n**Zombie Starter:**  \nNo one knows quite when the outbreak started, however it swept over the globe causing panic. People eating people. People dying and coming back to life as a shambling corpse joining the armies of similar creatures. Society crumbled over time and the cities which were now hot zones for hordes of the undead creatures were left abandoned to all but the most daring or desperate of individuals. However, these rabid hordes weren\u2019t the only thing to look out for in the apocalypse.\n\nSociety had begun to reform in its most primal form. People grouped together for safety. Those who just wanted to live peacefully became easy prey for those who saw the end of the world as we knew it as a playground to kill pillage and steal what they\u2019d like. These bandits created their own factions with their own fortresses and seemed to have an endless supply of guns and ammo as they used it quite liberally.\n\nI had been on the trail of a particularly nasty group of bandits as they razed whatever small settlements, they had to the ground callously and without mercy. I had just arrived at one of these towns. Dying people lay scattered about while fires licked at the makeshift buildings. It was still quite fresh. Approaching a nearby body which seemed to be moving slightly I turned it over the man was in bad shape and was clearly on death\u2019s door. His eyes looking into mine in a pleading sense.\n\n\u201cDo you want me to make it quick?\u201d I asked him reaching my left hand down to my machete which hung on my belt. Weakly his hand reached out to grip my right as he gave a nod. I knew the death wouldn\u2019t be clean, as I unsheathed my blade. However, I couldn\u2019t waste any ammo on my pistol nor could I risk tipping off the bandits that did this that I was following them. With a quick swing I slammed the blade into the head of the man ending his life and after wiping the blade off on his shirt I slid it back into its sheath my eyes scanning the immediate area for any of the undead which had turned or for a slim chance of getting a glimpse of survivors.\n\n**Nuclear Apocalypse Starter:**\n\nThe world as we knew it ended in a flash. A white light followed by a rumble which washed over the world in nuclear fire. Billions died then and there reducing the world\u2019s population to the brink. Those who were lucky to survive a direct blast were mutated to become much different than humans and more akin to zombies. Those outside of it didn\u2019t have much quality of life as the radiation created mutated creatures which made living in a barren wasteland that much harder.\n\nThere were others however who were lucky enough to be given a spot in giant underground vaults. There they lived out their lives separated from the horrors that this new world wrought. One by one these vaults opened to allow these vault dwellers into the wasteland that was our world.\n\nTheir blue suits and clueless natures made them stand out and become easy prey to raiders, giant creatures and everything in between. Many of them didn\u2019t get far before being gutted and robbed for their illusive vault suits which earned enough to feed a scavenger or bandit for a month.\n\nThe world and society began to rebuild. And with small settlements and towns popping up here and there it wasn\u2019t all doom and gloom for the wasteland. Many were able to create jobs in local milita, mercenary work. Even trading or bartending.\n\nI was such a mercenary a few generations of my family lived through the bombing and the radiation which was lucky enough for me, I guess. I was hired to do whatever someone wanted for the right price. And today I was tasked with delving into a recently opened vault and check make contact with the inhabitants inside.\n\nColt python on my waist I headed over to the large vault door which at this point was sealed shut and knocked loudly. This job seemed rather easy and was paying a lot which made me wonder who I was working for and what purpose they had with these vault dwellers. However, I wasn\u2019t paid to ask questions nor did I really care at the end of the day. The less I knew the less guilt I could feel.\n\n**Idea 16: Space/Scifi.**  \n*(So this is a scifi adventure. My character is the captain of his own ship and is currently looking for recruits to join him and help run it. There will probably be lots of interesting planets our characters go to and I\u2019ll certainly be making them up as we go along! Your character can range as anything from a human to android or even an alien.)*\n\n**Starter:** Stepping out of The Tempest I breathed in the humid station air of Astra station. The station which was on the furthest reaches of the space ruled over the galactic council; was a haven for the depraved. Outlaws, mercenaries, drug dealers you name it Astra has it and in bountiful supply too.\n\nWhich made it a perfect spot to find someone who was desperate to get off the station. Someone who would work for cheap or for free. All I needed to do was to find them.  \n\u201cSchwarzer, don\u2019t forget to stock up on food, military rations are sad.\u201d A voice commented through the earpiece I had.  \n\u201cYeah. I\u2019ll head through the slums and to the market. Thanks, Evai.\u201d I responded.  \n\u201cAnd don\u2019t cause any trouble, I don\u2019t wanna rot in this ship while you\u2019re dead.\u201d The voice added on.  \n\u201cYeah yeah I\u2019ve got it.\u201d I responded as the communication line was severed and I started on my walk.\n\nI headed through a nearby door and down into the depths of the station. Soon I the overcrowded and frankly smelly slums. Beggars and gang members lined every corner all looking at me with a cautious eye as I passed. There were even a few tweaked out drug users laying scattered about in some dark corners. Even a few corpses.\n\nI didn\u2019t stop though, if you stayed in one place too long down here you were asking to be jumped and quickly, I pushed on heading over to the bustling markets. The food quality here wasn\u2019t the best although it was abundant. I even talked to a few of the store owners to see if they knew where I could find the extra hands to help me on my ship.\n\n**Idea 17: Brother sister/Mother son (Or both).**  \n(*So, this starter is gonna be fairly generic, however it\u2019s open to allowing any of the familial ties to be easily included. I have a few ideas for immediate family and will post them below and if you have any ideas, I\u2019m happy to hear them.)*\n\n**Starter:** It\u2019s a hot and lazy day in the middle of summer break. I had laid splayed out on the couch at home. Despite the air conditioner being on full blast my skin underneath my tank top was getting stuck to the leather couch; which did little to alleviate the heat fluster that was going on. I sighed after looking over the back of the couch to the pool outback longingly. I sighed a little resigning myself to bite the bullet and peeled myself from the couch.\n\nAs much as I wanted to strip down and run out, I wasn\u2019t entirely sure if I was home alone and as such, I headed up to my room to change into a pair of swimming trunks before heading back downstairs. Passing through the laundry and grabbing a towel on the way.\n\nI headed onto the back deck and draped my towel over the railing before I rushed over and leapt into the pool immediately feeling the cool water wash away any of the heat I had been feeling. I resurface and breathed a sigh of relief as I pushed my messy hair back from my face.\n\n**Idea 18: Aunt/Cousin (Can be both).**  \n*(Again like the incest scene above I\u2019m not quite sure how to spruce this one up so I\u2019ll leave it rather basic and we can go from there.)*\n\n**Starter:** My family has gone on holiday without me as I had to stay behind due to being caught up in exams. Rather than meeting up with them later they decided it would be more fun for me if I finished them up then headed over to spend some time with my Aunt and my cousin across the county. While I wouldn\u2019t be leaving the country, I was still getting a vacation in a way and as such I tried my best to be upbeat and positive about it, even if I was envious of the others.\n\nWhile it wasn\u2019t the same pristine beaches and high-class resorts that the rest of my family was going to, I was still grateful for the hospitality. The plane lands in the airport and after collecting my bags and checking my phone for a confirmation I was going to be picked up I sent my family and my aunt and cousin a quick text telling them I landed safely. After gathering my small suitcase from the conveyor belt, I wheeled it through security and out to the meeting area keeping my eyes peeled for any sign of my cousin or my auntie. There was a little confusion about who was going to greet me so I wasn\u2019t sure who to expect myself.\n\n**Idea 19: Incest family vacation.**  \n*(So, this one is again going to be like the other two before it. They kinda roll off each other in a way.* *However, I believe it allows for a wide range of engagements with multiple characters at some kind of beach resort.)*\n\n**Starter:** It\u2019s the dead middle of another scorching summer and rather than tough it out in our homes which has air-conditioning which never seemed to help, our large family decided to all go to a large resort (Could even be a cruise too) together. Many of the rooms were rather luxurious and I was more than excited to see what the rest of the hotel had to offer.\n\nWe pulled up into the lobby and while the parents were checking in I headed over to check out a map on the wall. It seemed there were quite a lot of different things to do around the resort. There was a pool with a poolside bar, a beach which had volleyball games, a massage parlour, hot tubs and many different activities ranging from native dances to eating competitions.\n\nJust the realization we were here and the excitement at the many possibilities that could come from the vacation. Maybe I\u2019d even meet someone nice and have a vacation fling. Although with so many family members running around, I doubted that I\u2019d get much peace to do that. Regardless I was eager to get up to the room, have a shower and change into my swimming trunks to explore all the different places.\n\nWe headed up to the rooms where I noticed mine had a large double bed. However, judging by my mother\u2019s comments outside It seemed there was some kind of mix-up in the rooms and I\u2019d be sharing the room with one of my family members. Not that I minded too much. I placed my suitcase down and waited to see who would come in and if they were interested in joining me look around.\n\n**Closing words:** So yeah that\u2019s about it! Thanks for reading and if you have any questions or suggestions, I\u2019m open to hearing them! I know this was probably a big read so thanks again for your time and I hope to talk to some of you soon!",

            "selftext": "Alright  before reading this, and before you start getting into the idea of  role-playing with me, you need to know you\u2019re going to have to be  patient with my replies, I have a job now, my replies may be slow, but I  will try to make it entertaining and erotic for you, also with one of  my prompts I had so many replies, I lost track of who actually wanted to  role-play what.\n\nSo what if there  was a transfer teacher at UA teaching English, a hero from the UK, a pro  hero my hero academia version of myself who\u2019s quirk was simply just  physically amplification, allowing them to heal better than others as a  slow regenerative healing factor so long as they are eating enough  protein and other vitamins and minerals for the body to regenerate and  have better reflexes, and if they work hard enough at the gym, then they  have more stamina and strength than their body should proportionally be  able to work up to have.\n\nHero  name warrior, they are a sort of martial artist physical tank type hero,  physically speaking in terms of strength he can beat Endeavour, but he  can\u2019t exactly shoot fire, so there are a number of advantages that  endeavour would have if they ever had a disagreement.\n\nIn the UA classes, instead of going by his hero name he goes by, Sensei Thorn or Mr Thorn.\n\nAs  for a hero costume, back when he was in the west, he just wore a suit  of armour, while in Europe it was a European knight\u2019s suit of armour,  while overseas in Japan, Samurai armour because why not, in terms of  support items if it ever were to come up in the role-play because I  don\u2019t mind where it goes, hand held Martial weapons, as somewhat like  early series Endeavour, if push comes to shove, killing is an option,  but last resort.\n\nDue to my ability  to heal, my character doesn\u2019t need as much sleep as others, so my  character could double up as a gym instructor, or have a day life as a  teacher and a night life running a hero agency, and scouting UA for  sidekicks, of course only the female students.\n\nI  am sure that a few characters will not like my character, (for example  Mineta). As my character is the newest teacher at UA. A tall handsome  fit and toned foreigner who gives plenty of attention to the female  students as I show my charming smile and personality, explaining that  I\u2019m simply interested in how useful their quirks could be as potential  sidekicks. \u201cAfter all Momo isn\u2019t simply just a beautiful pretty face  with a wonderful dark eyes the colour of jades, no her quirk could be  incredibly useful for me, for example if I need a staff, a sword or a  bow and arrow, she could just give it to me, why would I not want to  talk her into being my sidekick for me in the future.\u201d\n\nEvery  instance where one of the students might be worried that I\u2019m trying to  flirt with one of the girls and get them under my control, hand waved  away with my confidence and charm and wit, until one of the girls in  class 1A, becomes my personal plaything, but she won\u2019t be the last.\n\nWhat  will start out at first as a taboo student teacher relationship, will  quickly become controlling and abusive as I start to bring race play  into it, and soon even though which ever character you pick to role-play  as to be my first plaything, they will end up being simply a member of  my harem, until you find yourself no longer disgusted at the idea, but  longing for another slap on the, a UA student humiliated in broad  daylight like I am entitled to you, like you are an object.\n\nAt  first your characters will try their hardest to make me think you are  repulsed when I tell them that it\u2019s what all their exotic rice whore  bodies are good for as I comment on your beauty and show of my  confidence, all your characters will try to pretend that I\u2019m not getting  into your head I tease you telling you that we both know Asian women  are naturally submissive.\n\nThe more  your character(s) see my confident, arrogant entitled eyes and smile  looking down into your eyes burning into your soul washing your will  away, the more you feel it\u2019s hard to say now.\n\nI  have a number of kinks including humiliation, degradation, bondage  objectification, Bimbofication, race play, misogyny, female and Asian  inferiority, so I thought it would be fun to make this prompt.\n\nMy kinks include.\nMisogyny.\nFemale humiliation.\nFemale degradation.\nBimbofiction (a little bit).\nHypnosis (a little bit).\nFemale objectification.\nRape.\nDomestic Abuse.\nAge Gap (I prefer to be older).\nRough Sex.\nIntelligence Loss.\nFemale Inferiority.\nBondage.\nWhipping.\nBody Writing/Queen of Hearts/Bleached Tattoos.\nFemale Orgasm Denial and Edging.\nSlave Training/Tasks.\nMale and Racial Supremacy and Worship.\n\nNot  all of my kinks need to be brought into the story, because it is  important for us both to enjoy it, if you want to role-play, it is  important for me to know your limits, so that we can both enjoy this, we  might share 2 kinks in common and then the rest are limits for you, in  which case I would need to know so that we can both enjoy this, or  perhaps you share all of my kinks.\n\nIf you want to role-play with me, let\u2019s message each other.",

Well, there\u2019s an abundance of sex scenes in both but, why don\u2019t we make some more?\n\nI am willing and able to play any named Game of Thrones character (Or a few Oc\u2019s) in a sexual way. This will be purely smut so don\u2019t expect a lot of story based shit unless you really want it.\n\nIf this becomes a more long term thing, you\u2019ll have your choice after each \u201csession\u201d to pick which character you would like to play or play as.\n\nThings I want out of you: 5+ lines per response at least. I know it sounds harsh but I prefer longe responses as it makes it more enjoyable and keeps me from getting bored. I also expect us both to be aware that we are both people and we should certainly keep that in mind.\n\nAnywho! If you\u2019re interested in this please send me a message and I look forward to seeing (and rping) with you all!",

            "selftext": "[Opened as long as you can see it]\n\nGood day everyone! I recently made an alt Reddit account shortly after my main one for subs like these. I've got about three weeks of experience on this platform thus far, but I'm by no means an amateur when it comes to roleplay! Today I'm in the mood for a particular roleplay involving a game of a series near and dear to me, and my favorite character within that game.\n\nYou already saw the title, so you know it's Fire Emblem. And yeah, it's Three Houses. Shocker, I know. The character in question is none other than our dear eternal loner, Bernadetta Von Varley! I will be playing as her for this roleplay, in all of her glory.\n\nI have two plots in mind for a roleplay with her, but feel free to weak these ideas or propose your own.\n\nThe first one is rather simple; some time after Bernadetta marries your character, some talk between the two of rhem emerges about them potentially raising a family. And we all know how those start!\n\nThe second one is a bit different and could perhaps lead to some fluffier/sweeter moments; in this one, Bernadetta sustains an injury (perhaps a sprained ankle) that will keep her bedridden until it heals. At first, she thinks that this is amazing. She has an excuse to stay in her room all day for weeks, maybe even a month or two! Though it's a lot less exciting when your character is assigned as her caretaker, either because they volunteered, or are perhaps at fault for her injury. Either way, it's their job to deliver food and water, and to make sure that she is caught up on her studies and training. Overtime, they start to bond, and Bernadetta starts having him stick around longer and longer. And... Let's just say their relationship reaches a climax...\n\nYou can play just about any character that has romantic supports with Bernadetta, or you can even submit your own OC if you'd like!\n\nHere is my f-list: https://www.f-list.net/c/heartgasm/\n\nNot all kinks can/will apply, and that's okay! And feel free to ask about any kinks in the \"maybe\" section and we can talk about potentially including them if you enjoy them.\n\nAs for my personal roleplay style, I tend to write in first-person for OCs, and third-person for anyone else. I write a decent bit, but I'm not really sure how much text can fit into a \"line\" on Reddit, so I can't really quantify it right now. I also have good grammar, and I don't use asterisks. As for how to contact me, I prefer DMs/texts over inbox messages, as the latter can get kinda crowded.\n\nAlso, I am aware that we both have lives, so even if I'm feeling lonely, I won't be upset at you if you are unable to reply. Take your time if you really need it! I'm gonna log off of Reddit and sift through replies later, so I won't reply immediately, but I hope to hear from you soon!",

            "selftext": "I will roleplay a crime lord, I can be 30 or another age if you want.\n\n\n\nAs    a Crime lord I have been rising in power and expanding aggressively  in   England, trading in sex slaves and drugs, with my ruthlessness I  have   even started to corrupt politics and as I expand aggressively I  am   starting to affect other countries, as a result of my ruthlessness  and   the fact that wherever you are necessarily not safe from my  influence   you have decided to try and take me down so you start to  research me.\n\n\n\nYou   learn every  time someone challenges my leadership I take off my suit   and tie and  humbly wear a Gi (Martial Art training uniform) they are   allowed any  melee weapon of their choice, they can even fight me as a    team, I  have these battles filmed and have the footage placed on the   Internet  as a form of propaganda.\n\n\n\nDue to my fitness, my training and my ruthlessness my villain name/crime name is the Conqueror.\n\n\n\nYou    have watched some of my battles on the Internet to research me, every    attack missed me and I perfectly disarmed every weapon, in one video    that filled you with fear, it was 5vs1 and I didn\u2019t even sweat once.  The   last opponent that I defeated was a woman who questioned my  leadership   thinking I was too ruthless, in the video you even see me  rape her  from  the video you can see I am at least 10 inches long.\n\n\n\nAfter    seeing me in action you have decided to take me down, even if it   causes  a power vacuum it has to be better than my rule empire. But   instead I  will end up wearing you down and humiliating you, beating you   down to  your knees breaking your will and crushing your resistance  and  use your  body is my new play thing and slave ending your super  heroine  life.\n\n\nAs  for how the  Conqueror  looks, personality and powers. The Conqueror is a  raging  egomaniac with  a holier than thou mind set and a god complex  demanding  to be  worshipped like a god, believing he is impossibly  powerful, and  tell no  one his powers to create a ora of mystery of how  powerful and   dangerour he is, charasmatic sadistic and loves to see the  fear in   someones eyes as they loose to him. He loves to take control and  power   and infulence over others, hence the criminal empire and  corrupting   politics. He has a perfect toned physique yet hairy body,  imagine a 7ft   tall blonde version of Sephiroth from Final Fantasy with a  more hairy   body.\n\n\n\nHis powers are as follows.\n\nImmense pain tolerance.\n\nSuper human speed.\n\nSuper human reflexes.\n\nSuper human strength.\n\nSuper human durability.\n\nSuper human stamina and stamina regeneration.\n\nSuper senses.\n\nGreater healing creating a much stronger appitite and motabolisim.\n\nAlso tecknically Martial Arts (unarmed and melee weapons) mastery could be counted as a \"power\" but he wasn't born with that.\n\n\n\nYou    can Describe to me any superheroine body type costume, superheroine    name, The age you will role-play, any powers in the weaknesses you  have,   and any other details that may make this fun.\n\n\n\nWhen you have described that, this is the start of the role-play. Here is a portenal start.\n\n\n\nYou    have broken down the gates to my mansion, every guard has fired shots    at you relentlessly like their life depends on it and has even tried    knives and fists, clearly they are afraid of me and failing and        disappointing me, with all my Guards defeated you have broken into my    mansion and find women in cages wearing slave collars, they desperately    beg for you to release them, of course you break them free and tell   them  to run to the police and they thank you before you make your way   to my  personal study, and you see me reading a book drinking whiskey,   dressed  in my suit as if you mean nothing to me, there is no way I   would not  have known that you are coming, but I clearly don\u2019t even   respect you  enough to get dressed for battle. That\u2019s the start of the   role-play  unless you have another idea.\n\n\n\nMy kinks include.\n\nMisogyny.\n\nFemale humiliation.\n\nFemale degradation.\n\nBimbofiction (a little bit).\n\nHypnosis (a little bit).\n\nFemale objectification.\n\nRape.\n\nDomestic Abuse.\n\nAge Gap (I prefer to be older).\n\nRough Sex.\n\nIntelligence Loss.\n\nFemale Inferiority.\n\nBondage.\n\nWhipping.\n\nBody Writing/Queen of Hearts/Bleached Tattoos.\n\nFemale Orgasm Denial and Edging.\n\nSlave Training/Tasks.\n\nMale and Racial Supremacy and Worship.\n\n\n\nNot    all of my kinks need to be brought into the story, because it is    important for us both to enjoy it, if you want to role-play, it is    important for me to know your limits, so that we can both enjoy this, we might share 2 kinks in common and then the rest are limits for   you,  in which case I would need to know so that we can both enjoy this,   or  perhaps you share all of my kinks.\n\n\n\nIf you want to role-play with me, let\u2019s message each other.\n\n\n\nNow    I would love to discuss kinks over messages or chat, and if you want   to  change some details around, we can do before starting, but you get   the  general idea, message me or start a chat if you are  interested in   see  where we could go from here.",

            "selftext": " \n\nHey there! Today I\u2019ve got a massive list of rp ideas and have written out some starters along with some ideas to how I see the rp going. I\u2019m open to change and ready to do other ideas too. So if you feel like you\u2019ve got an idea I might be interested in feel free to talk to me about those: ).\n\nAs for my replies. I write in first person mainly and my reply length varies. I generally do anything from a few sentences to a paragraph or more and generally require my partner to do the same. Fair warning the less detail you reply with the less interested I\u2019ll be in rping with you. (Not looking for a few words as a response)\n\nI enjoy having a story to go along with the smut so it\u2019s not just constant sex, some cute or action driven moments are fun as well. \u2013 Hand holding and cute dates are pleasant!  \nI mainly do my rps on kik, discord or here. I also have an RP facebook account, so feel free to ask for my users for those! : )\n\nMy kinks and limits list might be a big read, but none are compulsory. I\u2019m just here to have fun and hopefully meet some cool rp partners : )\n\nKinks: Harems (Doesn\u2019t mean having to play all characters at once, just one by one is fine!), Incest, Outercourse (Which is stuff like titjobs, thigh jobs, grinding, hot dogging) Risky public spaces (Toilet stalls, changing booths. That kinda thing where people could get caught.) Facials, Freckles (Face and body). Big/nicely shaped bums (Especially if they jiggle). Creampies, Cum on tits/body, big cumshots, Thigh high socks. shower/water sex (pools, shower, hot tubs ect.) Mutual desire for sex.\n\nLimits: Pregnancy (Hard limit sorry), Vomit, Piss, Blood, Toilet stuff, Rape, Gangbangs (Unless it\u2019s multiple females) Male on Male, futas, rimming/pegging.\n\nThere might be more that I\u2019m forgetting so if you\u2019re unsure feel free to ask me! The rougher side of sex like Name calling, slapping choking spanking I can all do as well! : ) Without further ado let\u2019s jump into the starters!\n\n*Disclaimer: I am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+*\n\nHere's the basic list of ideas if you wanted to look them over before reading the full posts. I\u2019m also open to some ideas that I may have missed! And please note: I\u2019m looking for FEMALE characters only!\n\n**Rule 34/Fandom/Game Ideas:**  \n**Idea 1: My Harem (Hero) Academia.**  \n**Idea 2: Pok\u00e9mon**  \n**Idea 3: Naruto**  \n**Idea 4: Bleach**  \n**Idea 5: One piece.**  \n**Idea 6: Sword Art Online.**  \n**Idea 7: Fairy Tail.**  \n**Idea 8: Avatar The Last Airbender.**  \n**Idea 9: Persona (Girls from 4 and 5).**  \n**Idea 10: Harry Potter.**  \n**Idea 11: Final Fantasy.**  \n**Idea 12: The Witcher 3.**\n\n**OC Ideas:**  \n**Idea 13: Fantasy harem adventure.**  \n**Idea 14: Only Man of the town.**  \n**Idea 15: Zombie and Nuclear Apocalypse.**  \n**Idea 16: Sci-Fi space crew.**\n\n**Incest Ideas:**  \n**Idea 17: Brother sister/Mother son (Or both).**  \n**Idea 18: Aunt/Cousin. (Can be both)**  \n**Idea 19: Incest family vacation.**\n\n**Idea 1: My Harem (Hero) Academia.**\n\n*(So my character will be a transfer into Class 1-A. His power is the power of persuasion. With the power he\u2019s able to convince someone to do something as if it\u2019s their own will. However, he\u2019s hesitant to use it on other people and to tell everyone he even has it as he\u2019s been outcast at his last school for the villainous nature of his quirk. As such he can\u2019t use it to its full extent and can only issue small commands to begin with.*\n\n*My idea with this is that one or more (cannon or non) of the girls decide to help him out in a private setting and overtime it gets more and more sexual in nature. And as he becomes more confident, he\u2019s able to issue more longer-term commands. This can also be mixed in well with some story and some action to keep the plot interesting.)*\n\n**Starter:** It was a day which started like most others in Class 1-A. The students got ready in the dorms and headed to class to chat among themselves while they waited for Aizawa to enter. However, unlike most days there seemed to be an extra desk placed in the room. The seat caused some confusion which didn\u2019t last long as the first bell rang and Aizawa entered the room.\n\n\u201cMorning everyone.\u201d He stated in his mainly bored and sleepy tone which seemed to sound like he was stifling a yawn. \u201cToday we\u2019ve got a new student transferring in from another school. He\u2019s from Shiketsu, some of you may recognize the name since it\u2019s got the same level as prestige as U.A. but regardless make sure he feels welcome.\u201d He said pointing a sweeping stare at everyone and finally resting on the problem child of the U.A class Bakugo.\n\nWith that he fell silent and I felt it was my cue to enter. Swallowing a little at the nerves I steeled them quickly and entered. My blue eyes sweeping over some of the familiar faces in the room. Many of the students had standout performances in the UA sports festival and as well in the news reports about the villain attack on the training camp.\n\nI had a lot to live up to if I wanted to join these legends in training but regardless, I was determined to do just that. Breathing a little and shifting my auburn hair from my eyes I smiled the best I could. \u201cMy name is Schwarzer, Chris Schwarzer. It\u2019s a pleasure to meet you all.\u201d I say bowing to the class.\n\nSatisfied with the introduction Aizawa nodded to the spare seat in the room. Taking that as an order I nodded back and headed over to my seat sitting down and getting my books out. Curiously I turned to the seat next to me noticing one of the girls in the class and gave her a slight smile as Aizawa began his lesson.\n\n**Idea 2: Pokemon.**  \n(*So this one is super simple. Some trainers or a trainer and his Pok\u00e9mon go on a grand adventure. For this one my favourite Canon female are: Marnie, May, Hilda and May. And my favourite Anthro Pok\u00e9mon are Lopunny, Arcanine, Blaiziken That\u2019s just for reference though and you can really play whoever you like! Ocs are of course welcome too!)*\n\n**Trainer x Trainer Starter**:\n\nI like many others in the world of Pok\u00e9mon have just started on my journey. Although I had done so a little late. Regardless me and my starter Pok\u00e9mon Aipom which was a gift from my late father. Setting off with excitement to make a name of myself.\n\nThat excitement wore off pretty quickly however as an advanced trainer stepped in my path and soon, I realized how big the gap between us was. He wiped the floor with my aipom and laughed as he took my \u201cPrize money\u201d Scooping up my aipom I rushed through the rest of the route and over to the next town ducking quickly into the Pok\u00e9mon centre.\n\nLooking around there was a few new trainers who seemed to have fallen to the same fate as I had and I shook my head. Guys like that were total assholes and without hesitating I headed over to the counter where the nurse took my Aipom from me. Once he was gone, I was told there was going to be a short wait due to the amount of Pok\u00e9mon they had to treat. I nodded as I headed over and sat down in one of the seats.\n\n**Idea 3: Naruto.**  \n(*So for this one I like the idea that my character is a nomadic mercenary hired by the leaf to help train the ninja of the village, maybe he also has some kind of hidden power that boosts his chakra but also increases his libido. Not too sure how I wanna go about this one.*)\n\n**Starter:** The Hokage Tsunade Senju looked over me with a curious gaze and then down to my application form. \u201cYou\u2019re younger than I expected given everything you\u2019ve done.\u201d She stated honestly. \u201cBut the intelligence division did a thorough search into you and you check out.\u201d She stated as she slammed the approved stamp down onto my paper.\n\n\u201cJust remember, if you do anything to endanger this village, I\u2019ll snuff you out personally.\u201d She said in an icy and threatening tone.  \nFeeling a cold bead of sweat roll down the side of my face I nodded. \u201cOf course. I wouldn\u2019t dream of it.\u201d I say. Internally I make a mental note not to cross her in any way.\n\n\u201cGood.\u201d She said putting a smile across her features. \u201cYour first group is down on the training field waiting for you already.\u201d She stated. \u201cYour lodgings will be set up by the time you\u2019re done, here\u2019s the key.\u201d She said tossing the key to me which I caught and stuffed into my pocket.  \nI was a little shocked with how quick she wanted me to get to work but I nodded. \u201cRight!\u201d I say giving a respectful bow before heading out.\n\nIt took me a little longer than expected to actually find the training grounds as I hadn\u2019t ever been here before. And when I got there much to her credit there were a few ninja standing around. Approaching them I gave them a sheepish smile. \u201cSorry I\u2019m late guys.\u201d I called out. \u201cI got lost.\u201d I added on.\n\n**Idea 4: Bleach.**  \n(*So a new human soul reaper makes it into the soul society. His power isn\u2019t captain level to begin with simply being enough to take out the average hollow. And with the resurgence of the hollow threat the Soul Society has offered to give him a substitute badge to take out those hollows deemed too small for the soul society to handle. Maybe he\u2019s paired up with someone or someone like Orihime steps in to help him grow.*)\n\n**Starter:** Another boring day at school followed by a night of boring patrols. With all the big hollows being taken care of by \u201cFull-fledged\u201d Soul reapers it didn\u2019t leave me with much opportunity to train against bigger enemies.\n\nAt least that\u2019s what I thought originally. A few blocks from me there was a rift which opened up and the pure spiritual pressure that came from the hollow that stepped out of it was enough to make me feel as though gravity itself was pushing against me.\n\nIt was hard to breathe and even harder to stand as my hand clutched my blade in my left hand tightly. I shook my head as I heard the loud roar of the large breast and could even see it\u2019s towering form from my position.\n\nIt was nothing close to a menos, but it was enough to tower over a three-story building for sure. \u201cShit.\u201d I hissed to myself as I knew there were no soul reapers around at this stage. With a threat this big I was sure they\u2019d come, but until then it was up to me to buy some time and make sure no humans or souls were consumed.\n\nPushing myself forward I reached the park that the Hollow had appeared in. Thankfully the park was deserted at this time of night.  \nWhen he saw me the hollow. \u201cYou don\u2019t smell like much, but you\u2019ll do as a snack.\u201d The hollow commented as it charged forward.  \n\u201cJust evade, buy time.\u201d I comment to myself as I began to leap around the battle field looking a bit like and feeling like an idiot.\n\nThe hollow toyed with me a little while enjoying the chase before it seemed to ger bored. Just when I was thinking I was fast enough to keep avoiding it the creature\u2019s mouth opened and its forked tongue shot out at me with faster speed than I was anticipating I raised my blade to defend myself but it was a feeble attempt and I knew it wouldn\u2019t be enough.\n\n**Idea 5: One Piece.**  \n(*So I\u2019m not quite sure how to approach this one, but I\u2019ll give it a go. Much like the MHA starter my character will have the power of persuasion, having eaten the Persua-Persua fruit. I\u2019m thinking either he joins the Strawhats and goes on their adventures or he makes his own crew with girls from the story, I\u2019m gonna leave it fairly open ended so we can jump in whenever along the story we wanna go!)*\n\n**Starter:** Alone in a bar I sat staring in the amber liquid in my mug. I was down on my luck after having my whole crew and my ship destroyed in a long battle another pirate crew. The only reason I was able to live through the ordeal was due to my crew sacrificing themselves to give me a chance to escape.\n\nI spent days adrift with little food and water and soon washed up upon the island I was in. Immediately I found a tavern ready to drown my sorrows and feel sorry for myself for a little while.\n\nLetting out a sigh I downed the rest of my drink soon looking at the few drops of liquid bottom of my mug. I knew being a pirate wouldn\u2019t be easy, I knew it\u2019d be violent and end in violence. However, to lose in that fashion without even being able to use my devil fruit to calm or question our opponent and losing everything still took its toll on me.\n\nScratching at the growing stubble with one hand, the other I raised my mug to demand another drink and as such the bartender approached to fill my mug.  \n\u201cYou\u2019re looking a little rough there, you sure you need another?\u201d The bartender asked as he took the mug from me.  \n\u201cI don\u2019t have anything else to do. I don\u2019t even know what else to do with myself.\u201d I responded grumpily. \u201cJust fill it up.\u201d I demanded.  \n\u201cRight.\u201d The bartender responded as he filled it with more of the alcoholic amber liquid and slid It in front of me.\n\n**Idea 6: Sword Art Online.**  \n(*Fairly simple it\u2019s SAO set in the original death game. I love the idea, so I\u2019ve always loved rping this one. If you want to play canon characters my fave is for sure Lizbeth, but I\u2019m open to OC characters!)*\n\n**Starter**: It\u2019s been months since Akihiko Kayaba has trapped us into this death game. Or at least that\u2019s how some people looked at it. Others saw it as their dream come true. But most if not, all wanted to push forward and beat the game.\n\nDespite the desire to push forward little progress has been made. Guilds and parties have formed to push through dungeons but with the increased danger and with it more deaths; more and more people simply decided to live out their lives on the lower floors.\n\nUnlike those rushing in to push through the content I was happy enough to go through it at my own pace. This place was like a dream for me, save for the fact I had an increased chance of dying I was able to live in this game without the worries of the outside world.\n\nI was doing some late-night grinding in an area of dense forest. The sun had set and there was little light save for the bright moon poking through the trees. All was calm, the trees swayed with the wind and the occasional sound of creatures moving about was enough to calm me.\n\nHowever, the deeper I got into the forest the louder a sound became. At first it was quiet but as I approached, I heard it more clearly. It sounded like steel clashing against steel. Someone was fighting. Moving from a casual walk into a jog I quickly came to a small clearing where I saw two figures fighting, although in the low light I couldn\u2019t make it out until I got closer.\n\n**Idea 7: Fairy Tail.**  \n(*it\u2019s been a little while since I\u2019ve seen the series, but I\u2019ve always loved it! Given my time away I might have to take some time to refamiliarize myself with the magics. My character will simply be an entry level member into the guild to begin with, canon characters are welcome just as OCs are!*)\n\n**Starter**: Another day in magnolia and another party being held at the large guild building at the centre of town. A large-scale job had just finished with some of the senior ranking wizards. and even though I wasn\u2019t part of that mission, instead being on my own D-Rank job I joined in on the celebrations.\n\nI had only been part of the guild for a few days and so far, it\u2019s not been as exciting as I\u2019d hoped, although I figured that it\u2019d pick up once I proved myself. I was drinking by myself when I was approached by Makarov. He was wearing an essentric looking orange outfit. \u201cSchwarzer my boy!\u201d He said as he patted me on the shoulder. \u201cHow are you fitting in?\u201d He questioned.  \n\u201cFine sir! Everyone has been very welcoming.\u201d I say to him in response.  \n\u201cGlad to hear it! You\u2019ve been doing a good job, although I\u2019d like to see you do more.\u201d The male said. \u201cSo I\u2019ve arranged a partner for you on your next job, that way you can take something more challenging, what do you say?\u201d He questioned.\n\n\u201cYes of course!\u201d I say eagerly as a smile spread across my face.  \n\u201cGreat!\u201d He said cheerfully. \u201cI\u2019ll introduce you to who you\u2019ll be working with.\u201d He said as he stood from his spot and lead the way over to a female clearing his throat loud enough to get their attention.\n\n**Idea 8: Avatar the Last Airbender.**  \n(*So for this one I guess it can go two different ways. My fave girls from Avatar would probably be Ty Lee, Suki and Toph. Maybe my character is a powerful bender that either the fire nation or team Avatar wants on their side. I think it might be cool to think that Aang isn\u2019t the only airbender and instead a small faction managed to escape and continue the lineage. Either that or my character is a powerful firebender of some kind. I\u2019ll leave whichever you prefer to you in your first reply as I\u2019ll leave it open ended.)*\n\n**Starter:** The world was at war ever since the Fire nation attacked. With the intense fighting came mercenaries. Freelance benders or soldiers ready to fight on either side. For a fee of course. And despite my age, being only eighteen I was quite renown amongst the other bounty hunters for my bending.\n\nOf course, there were talks of the Avatar returning, having repelled an invasion in the south pole, the liberation of Omashu and then the fire nation prison. It seemed they were making quite the stir in the earth kingdom.\n\nIt\u2019d only be a matter of time before they reached the small town, I was in. Perhaps they were already here. But if that was the case surely there would be some kind of stir. Pushing my hair from my face I ordered another drink from the barkeep.  \n\u201cYou know you\u2019re my favourite customer Schwarzer\u2026. You\u2019re the only one who consistently pays his tab. Unlike the rest of these soldiers or the workers around here.\u201d The older man says in clear annoyance.\n\n\u201cWell who knows, if I wasn\u2019t so successful, I\u2019d probably mooch off you too.\u201d I admitted with a grin. \u201cTry not to talk too ill of the soldiers on either side.\u201d I added on flicking him an extra coin for a tip once my drink was finished. \u201cWell I better check if anyone has a job for me.\u201d I say as I pushed myself up from my seat.\n\n**Idea 9: Persona.**  \n(*So basically this is just gonna be a fairly interesting idea. My character along with the girls of persona 4 and 5 get stranded in this strange dimension where they have to fight their way out to make it back to their own worlds.*)\n\n**Starter:** It all happened so fast. One minute I was in a team meeting with my group discussing what we should use our newfound powers for next. And the next second, I had blinked and I was in some kind of strange room.\n\nOne by one more people were added into this room. Some of which were dressed in some elaborate costumes. And I frowned as I looked to each one of them, all of which I didn\u2019t recognize at all and judging by their looks they didn\u2019t recognize me. Although before we managed to introduce ourselves a booming voice broke the silence.\n\n\u201cWelcome all!\u201d The clearly male voice commented. \u201cTo the room of my design.\u201d He added on. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re all confused. And no doubt you\u2019ll want to return back to your homes. However, to do so you\u2019ll need to enter my labyrinth. \u201cMake it to the end and you\u2019ll all return home.\u201d The voice explained.\n\n\u201cOf course, this maze isn\u2019t without its dangers. Enemies, much like you encounter on a regular basis will roam these halls. As well as beasts of my own design far stronger than those\u2026 Fear no though for every check point you reach this room will become more furnished with amenities. For now, you simply have beds to rest on.\u201d He said as there was an audible click and the dark room was suddenly lit up. Sure, enough there were rows of beds all lined up one for each person to sleep on.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re ready to test yourselves step through this door and enter the first level of the labyrinth.\u201d He declared as a large door appeared and opened up in front of them.  \nFor a while nobody said anything probably all too stunned to even process the information. \u201cSo, I\u2019m guessing we\u2019re all persona users given what he just said.\u201d I spoke up. \u201cI guess we should probably start with names and strengths, right?\u201d I questioned the group. \u201cI\u2019m Chris Schwarzer.\u201d I say. \u201cMy persona Serapth focuses on ranged combat.\u201d I explained.\n\n**Idea 10: Harry Potter.**  \n(*So to keep this one interesting I\u2019m thinking of having it set in an AU where Voldemort and Harry don\u2019t exist. However, there are still dark wizards who are part of a cult around. Defs looking for a Hermionie, Luna or Ginny, you could even have other celebs/ecelebs as teachers or students for this one! Ocs are of course welcome too!)*\n\n**Starter:** Another year at Hogwarts, the last for some; and another year of learning was right around the corner. Although times were not peaceful in the wizarding world. Aurors who were the police of the magical world were going missing or showing up dead.\n\nThe ministry not wanting to make a panic kept it fairly under wraps, however some of the families have come forward with the information and rumours abounded about what was really happening.  \nStepping off the train I sighed a little rubbing my temple where a headache had begun to set in. During the train ride here, I found myself stuck next to a boy who wouldn\u2019t stop going on about the rumours and conspiracy theories.\n\nGlad to be off the train I looked around for a minute lost as to where I needed to go. \u201cI know it\u2019s around here somewhere.\u201d I commented, although my sense of direction was always off. Usually I followed everyone else. But this time it seemed I was one of the last ones off the train.\n\n**Idea 11: Final Fantasy.**  \n(*So this is simply going to be an idea with no starter since it will probably change depending on the many FF universes. My favourite however is defs FF7. (Tifa, Jessie and Aerith are best girls) with follow-ups being 12, 13, 15, 10, 8 and 9. Basically a fight would take the Main character of those series, Cloud, Noct, ect out of commission and needing a leader the other characters step up and hire mine on. Similar to some of my other prompts but I never said I was creative :\\^) With that being said though if you ARE interested in this one let me know and we can work out details depending on what world we\u2019re in!*)\n\n**Idea 12: The Witcher 3.**  \n(*So my character will be a Witcher. (wow!) Saving people, hunting things you know? The family business. Anyway, I\u2019m gonna leave it super open ended for you to come in however you like! If you wanna play a canon character my top two are for sure Ciri and Trist, and OC characters are accepted too!*)\n\n**Starter:** A Werewolf, an odd and rare contract, although I figured it wouldn\u2019t be a hard one. In face I figured with my silver blade that the creature would go down rather quickly. Starting the encounter, I was faced with a harsh reality due to my hubris. I started off well enough, however due to my carelessness I was quickly on the backfoot.\n\nThe beast roared as it swung its large clawed hand towards me. I had barely managed to roll out of the way of the attack. Probably due to the increasing levels of bloodless resulting in a careless action on my part. A level of confidence quickly pushed down by the fact a handful of open wounds stung at my flanks.\n\nMore scars for later given that I make it out of here, although with my silver blade thrown on the other side of the area leaving me with only a steel sword which barely even phases the thing. I had to reach my blade, although with my focus on dodging the attacks it was hard to find an opening to do so.\n\nI raised a hand and cast the igni sign launching flames at the creature who leapt back and I tried my best to make it past the creature only to have to dodge another strike as the beast recovered remarkably fast. \u201cStubborn bastard, aren\u2019t you?\u201d I questioned a little sourly.\n\n**Idea 13: Fantasy harem adventure.**  \n*(This one is fairly basic in nature. Basically, a young man with little combat experience leaves his poor hunting village once he\u2019s of age and sets off to join the adventurer\u2019s guild to make a name for himself and also to send money back home. He\u2019s fairly modest, naive and kind hearted. Which makes him likable and easy to take advantage of.*\n\n*We could add a story with war elements, racism and darker themes to show him that the world he idolizes isn\u2019t as cracked up as he thought it\u2019d be. Ideally, I\u2019d like a full harem party for this one but I\u2019m cool with one on one too.)*\n\n**Starter:** It had been a few days since I was finally able to leave the small village, I was raised in behind me. Sword on hip and keen to become an adventurer. Of course, I also wanted to make a name for myself and I was even more excited to see everything the world had to offer. With driving me forward I headed from my village over to the closest city which had a guild branch. A city called Ruan. It was nearly five times the size of my village if not more and yet it was nothing close to the capital city of Grancel.\n\nSmooth dirt paths soon gave way to cobblestone and my boots clacked rhythmically against the pavement as my steps soon got faster and faster as Ruan came into view. My stomach was in knots as I gripped the straps on my bag tightly and after steeling my nerves and taking in the sight of the large city, I headed through the large stone arch to the busy streets beyond.\n\nMy excited eyes looked around at every nook and cranny as I took in every detail that was on offer. Soon coming across the large marble and wood building of the adventurer\u2019s guild in front of me. I stood in front of the large building clearly awestruck and for a moment I felt completely overwhelmed. This was it. This was the first step I was going to take on my journey and yet I felt far too nervous to head inside. Instead I stood there shaking slightly as I tried to work up the courage to push those large oak doors aside and declare my presence to the world.\n\n**Idea 14: Man of the town.**  \n*(So again the premise is also pretty basic. My character wakes up in a town where there\u2019s no men, as if they all vanished at once. Including his father which leaves him home alone with his sister and mother. (It\u2019s up to you if you want incest in the plot or not.)* *We can have a story with an element of mystery to it too if you want! Or we can just bounce around the town having him bonk as many different people as you want.)*\n\n**Starter:** It\u2019s been a few weeks since all the men in the town vanished one day. One day they were there and the next they were gone. There was of course a panic even though it is much calmer than originally, it continues to creep in the back of everyone\u2019s mind. It doesn\u2019t help the fact that no outsiders have come into the town and some strange thick fog seems to stop everyone from leaving.\n\nHowever, with no answers it was left to the women of the town to pick up the slack and try to push for some level of normalcy. Except for me it seemed. Since the whole act started, I was in lockdown not being free to leave my home since my mother and sister was much too paranoid that I\u2019d disappear too. With the amount of time I spent indoors going stir crazy I began to wonder if it was better to be wherever the rest of them are.\n\nToday was different though and finally I was given the chance to leave the house while my mother was careless and rather quickly, I headed out into the street just glad to take in the scenery as I headed over to a nearby park. I headed over the soft grass feeling it beneath my shoes and then to the pond where I took a seat on one of the mounted benches.\n\n**Idea 15: Zombie and Nuclear Apocalypse.**  \n*(Not a whole lot to say here other than it\u2019s one of your run of the mill Zombie/Nuclear apocalypse scenarios. I might toy with the idea of having multiple zombie types like games such as Dying light and Left for dead in order to spice things up a little but we\u2019ll see where we go with it. As for nuclear I\u2019ll probably be following along the Fallout franchise. Being part of these worlds will probably make my character a bit more brash, blunt and even a little rude. However, given some time he\u2019ll warm up.)*\n\n**Zombie Starter:**  \nNo one knows quite when the outbreak started, however it swept over the globe causing panic. People eating people. People dying and coming back to life as a shambling corpse joining the armies of similar creatures. Society crumbled over time and the cities which were now hot zones for hordes of the undead creatures were left abandoned to all but the most daring or desperate of individuals. However, these rabid hordes weren\u2019t the only thing to look out for in the apocalypse.\n\nSociety had begun to reform in its most primal form. People grouped together for safety. Those who just wanted to live peacefully became easy prey for those who saw the end of the world as we knew it as a playground to kill pillage and steal what they\u2019d like. These bandits created their own factions with their own fortresses and seemed to have an endless supply of guns and ammo as they used it quite liberally.\n\nI had been on the trail of a particularly nasty group of bandits as they razed whatever small settlements, they had to the ground callously and without mercy. I had just arrived at one of these towns. Dying people lay scattered about while fires licked at the makeshift buildings. It was still quite fresh. Approaching a nearby body which seemed to be moving slightly I turned it over the man was in bad shape and was clearly on death\u2019s door. His eyes looking into mine in a pleading sense.\n\n\u201cDo you want me to make it quick?\u201d I asked him reaching my left hand down to my machete which hung on my belt. Weakly his hand reached out to grip my right as he gave a nod. I knew the death wouldn\u2019t be clean, as I unsheathed my blade. However, I couldn\u2019t waste any ammo on my pistol nor could I risk tipping off the bandits that did this that I was following them. With a quick swing I slammed the blade into the head of the man ending his life and after wiping the blade off on his shirt I slid it back into its sheath my eyes scanning the immediate area for any of the undead which had turned or for a slim chance of getting a glimpse of survivors.\n\n**Nuclear Apocalypse Starter:**\n\nThe world as we knew it ended in a flash. A white light followed by a rumble which washed over the world in nuclear fire. Billions died then and there reducing the world\u2019s population to the brink. Those who were lucky to survive a direct blast were mutated to become much different than humans and more akin to zombies. Those outside of it didn\u2019t have much quality of life as the radiation created mutated creatures which made living in a barren wasteland that much harder.\n\nThere were others however who were lucky enough to be given a spot in giant underground vaults. There they lived out their lives separated from the horrors that this new world wrought. One by one these vaults opened to allow these vault dwellers into the wasteland that was our world.\n\nTheir blue suits and clueless natures made them stand out and become easy prey to raiders, giant creatures and everything in between. Many of them didn\u2019t get far before being gutted and robbed for their illusive vault suits which earned enough to feed a scavenger or bandit for a month.\n\nThe world and society began to rebuild. And with small settlements and towns popping up here and there it wasn\u2019t all doom and gloom for the wasteland. Many were able to create jobs in local milita, mercenary work. Even trading or bartending.\n\nI was such a mercenary a few generations of my family lived through the bombing and the radiation which was lucky enough for me, I guess. I was hired to do whatever someone wanted for the right price. And today I was tasked with delving into a recently opened vault and check make contact with the inhabitants inside.\n\nColt python on my waist I headed over to the large vault door which at this point was sealed shut and knocked loudly. This job seemed rather easy and was paying a lot which made me wonder who I was working for and what purpose they had with these vault dwellers. However, I wasn\u2019t paid to ask questions nor did I really care at the end of the day. The less I knew the less guilt I could feel.\n\n**Idea 16: Space/Scifi.**  \n*(So this is a scifi adventure. My character is the captain of his own ship and is currently looking for recruits to join him and help run it. There will probably be lots of interesting planets our characters go to and I\u2019ll certainly be making them up as we go along! Your character can range as anything from a human to android or even an alien.)*\n\n**Starter:** Stepping out of The Tempest I breathed in the humid station air of Astra station. The station which was on the furthest reaches of the space ruled over the galactic council; was a haven for the depraved. Outlaws, mercenaries, drug dealers you name it Astra has it and in bountiful supply too.\n\nWhich made it a perfect spot to find someone who was desperate to get off the station. Someone who would work for cheap or for free. All I needed to do was to find them.  \n\u201cSchwarzer, don\u2019t forget to stock up on food, military rations are sad.\u201d A voice commented through the earpiece I had.  \n\u201cYeah. I\u2019ll head through the slums and to the market. Thanks, Evai.\u201d I responded.  \n\u201cAnd don\u2019t cause any trouble, I don\u2019t wanna rot in this ship while you\u2019re dead.\u201d The voice added on.  \n\u201cYeah yeah I\u2019ve got it.\u201d I responded as the communication line was severed and I started on my walk.\n\nI headed through a nearby door and down into the depths of the station. Soon I the overcrowded and frankly smelly slums. Beggars and gang members lined every corner all looking at me with a cautious eye as I passed. There were even a few tweaked out drug users laying scattered about in some dark corners. Even a few corpses.\n\nI didn\u2019t stop though, if you stayed in one place too long down here you were asking to be jumped and quickly, I pushed on heading over to the bustling markets. The food quality here wasn\u2019t the best although it was abundant. I even talked to a few of the store owners to see if they knew where I could find the extra hands to help me on my ship.\n\n**Idea 17: Brother sister/Mother son (Or both).**  \n(*So, this starter is gonna be fairly generic, however it\u2019s open to allowing any of the familial ties to be easily included. I have a few ideas for immediate family and will post them below and if you have any ideas, I\u2019m happy to hear them.)*\n\n**Starter:** It\u2019s a hot and lazy day in the middle of summer break. I had laid splayed out on the couch at home. Despite the air conditioner being on full blast my skin underneath my tank top was getting stuck to the leather couch; which did little to alleviate the heat fluster that was going on. I sighed after looking over the back of the couch to the pool outback longingly. I sighed a little resigning myself to bite the bullet and peeled myself from the couch.\n\nAs much as I wanted to strip down and run out, I wasn\u2019t entirely sure if I was home alone and as such, I headed up to my room to change into a pair of swimming trunks before heading back downstairs. Passing through the laundry and grabbing a towel on the way.\n\nI headed onto the back deck and draped my towel over the railing before I rushed over and leapt into the pool immediately feeling the cool water wash away any of the heat I had been feeling. I resurface and breathed a sigh of relief as I pushed my messy hair back from my face.\n\n**Idea 18: Aunt/Cousin (Can be both).**  \n*(Again like the incest scene above I\u2019m not quite sure how to spruce this one up so I\u2019ll leave it rather basic and we can go from there.)*\n\n**Starter:** My family has gone on holiday without me as I had to stay behind due to being caught up in exams. Rather than meeting up with them later they decided it would be more fun for me if I finished them up then headed over to spend some time with my Aunt and my cousin across the county. While I wouldn\u2019t be leaving the country, I was still getting a vacation in a way and as such I tried my best to be upbeat and positive about it, even if I was envious of the others.\n\nWhile it wasn\u2019t the same pristine beaches and high-class resorts that the rest of my family was going to, I was still grateful for the hospitality. The plane lands in the airport and after collecting my bags and checking my phone for a confirmation I was going to be picked up I sent my family and my aunt and cousin a quick text telling them I landed safely. After gathering my small suitcase from the conveyor belt, I wheeled it through security and out to the meeting area keeping my eyes peeled for any sign of my cousin or my auntie. There was a little confusion about who was going to greet me so I wasn\u2019t sure who to expect myself.\n\n**Idea 19: Incest family vacation.**  \n*(So, this one is again going to be like the other two before it. They kinda roll off each other in a way.* *However, I believe it allows for a wide range of engagements with multiple characters at some kind of beach resort.)*\n\n**Starter:** It\u2019s the dead middle of another scorching summer and rather than tough it out in our homes which has air-conditioning which never seemed to help, our large family decided to all go to a large resort (Could even be a cruise too) together. Many of the rooms were rather luxurious and I was more than excited to see what the rest of the hotel had to offer.\n\nWe pulled up into the lobby and while the parents were checking in I headed over to check out a map on the wall. It seemed there were quite a lot of different things to do around the resort. There was a pool with a poolside bar, a beach which had volleyball games, a massage parlour, hot tubs and many different activities ranging from native dances to eating competitions.\n\nJust the realization we were here and the excitement at the many possibilities that could come from the vacation. Maybe I\u2019d even meet someone nice and have a vacation fling. Although with so many family members running around, I doubted that I\u2019d get much peace to do that. Regardless I was eager to get up to the room, have a shower and change into my swimming trunks to explore all the different places.\n\nWe headed up to the rooms where I noticed mine had a large double bed. However, judging by my mother\u2019s comments outside It seemed there was some kind of mix-up in the rooms and I\u2019d be sharing the room with one of my family members. Not that I minded too much. I placed my suitcase down and waited to see who would come in and if they were interested in joining me look around.\n\n**Closing words:** So yeah that\u2019s about it! Thanks for reading and if you have any questions or suggestions, I\u2019m open to hearing them! I know this was probably a big read so thanks again for your time and I hope to talk to some of you soon!",
