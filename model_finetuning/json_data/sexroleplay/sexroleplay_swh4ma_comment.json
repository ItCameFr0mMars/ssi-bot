            "body": "I hope you're flexible with kinks and limits. Here are mine:\n\nKinks: incest, age difference, step family (I don't know if that counts as a kink), forbidden love, free use, oral sex (even if it's sloppy), handjobs, receiving a blowjob AND handjob at the same time, tittyfucks, if I'm playing a submissive guy or girl then I like receiving rimjobs, throatfucking, hairpulling, vaginal sex, anal sex, heterosexual sex, homosexual sex, lesbian sex, interracial sex, rough yet passionate sex, risky sex (sex in risky places (places where you can get caught having sex (like a restaurant bathroom, etc)), pregnancy, breeding, rule34 (that includes sex with the supernatural (even aliens), furries and cartoon or video game babes), being cummed in and on (if I'm being submissive), cumming inside someone (and on someone (so facials and creampies) if they'd like) (if I'm dom), twerking, choking, spanking and consensual sex (That's all I can currently think of)\n\nI also don't mind gentle sex, romance (depending on the rp and the relationship between our characters) (is romance even a kink? I don't know but I'm putting it down as one), light bondage (ie tying someone up before fucking them - but that's as far as I'll go) or mattress breaking~\n\nLimits: Pedophilia, lolis and shotas (basically, if you want us to be kids, no ifs or buts, I'm blocking you because that's just wrong), degradation, being bitten, biting, sensation play, cum control, cum/orgasm denial (although, it does depend. I don't want my partner to cum early but yet I don't want them to last for what seems like forever either so...), forced stuff, hardcore bdsm, master/slave relationships, mistress/slave relationships, cuckold/cheating (well... Cheating just depends on my mood AND the characters we play), femdom (unless I'm doing a lesbian rp and the other girl is domming me either as a regular girl (ie a girl with a pussy as opposed to a futa) OR as a futa. If you want me to play a dominant futa tho, I can), physically abusing my sexual partner during sex, piss, shit, iceplay, dubcon, rape (that's all I can think of)",
